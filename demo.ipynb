In P. ginseng, cyclisation of 2,3-oxidosqualene to dammarenediol-II by DDS is the first reaction towards the biosynthesis of dammarane-type ginsenosides.

As this transition fundamentally changes what constitutes an individual, dissecting the steps in this transition remains a major challenge within evolutionary biology. Compared with other major transitions in evolution that occurred just once (for example, the origin of eukaryotes), multicellularity has evolved repeatedly. Indeed, cyanobacteria evolved simple filamentous multicellularity over 2.5 billion years ago, and entire clades of multicellular organisms have arisen in the last 200 million years (for example, brown algae and the volvocine algae). Most origins of multicellularity are ancient and transitional forms have been lost to extinction, so little is known about the potential for multicellularity to evolve from unicellular lineages, or the route through which a multicellular life history arises. Here we use experimental evolution to directly examine the first steps in this transition using the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This species is uniquely suited to such an investigation, as it has never had a multicellular ancestor and is closely related to the volvocine algae, a clade in which the historical order of multicellular adaptations has been inferred. Even within this lineage, there is evidence that multicellular forms with different levels of organization have evolved independently.',\n",

Although it is theoretically feasible, there has been no effective experimental approach to materialize it so far. To tackle this unresolved issue, the nanotesttube chemistry, in which a CNT is generally used as a container-cum-reactor, is found to be promising. There are several studies devoted to the fabrication of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) in CNTs through the confined polymerization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. In addition, the theoretical models proposed by Jiang et al. have suggested that the GNRs residing in CNTs would form a helical conformation due to the geometric constraints imposed by an outer tube. The geometric constraints would restrict the chirality of CNTs synthesized. By carefully choosing the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon precursors, one can, therefore, foresee a controllable tuning of the different chiralities synthesized. With the inner-shell extraction technique developed recently, precise verification of the CNTs synthesized is also possible through photoluminescence (PL) measurements.',\n",

DSBs are repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which often introduces short insertions or deletions (indels) at the sealed break, or by homology-directed repair (HDR), which faithfully restores the original sequence by copying it from the sister chromatid. These two pathways can be used for site-directed modification of the genome, although NHEJ is the dominant pathway of DSB repair in higher eukaryotic cells and organisms. Currently, ZFNs have been broadly applied to basic research, biotechnology and medicine, but genome engineering with programmable nucleases is limited by the inevitable production of DSBs and the reliance on error-prone NHEJ. Further, these programmable nucleases often induce randomly generated and unwanted indels at highly homologous sites. Furthermore, the nucleases inducing too many off-target DSBs are toxic to cells. Furter, it is difficult to isolate correctly gene-targeted cells. One potential strategy to overcome this limitation is the targeted introduction into DNA containing a SSB or nick. Like the DSB, a SSB/nick can theoretically stimulate the HDR pathway. In contrast to a DSB, it is important that a nick or SSB is not a bona fide substrate for repair by the NHEJ pathway. Thus, a targeted SSB has the potential to restrict repair to the HDR pathway.',\n",
       " 'Nucleation is a barrier-crossing process, in which a metastable phase decays via a critical nucleus for which the increase in surface free energy is compensated by the bulk energy decrease. If the cluster becomes bigger than the critical size, it grows, while if smaller, it shrinks. The size of a critical nucleus is determined by microscopic competition between the surface and bulk free energies of a microscopic cluster and thus the size of the critical nucleus is microscopic (see  and ). To be precise, this situation is realized in short-range interaction systems, where separation of the energy between the bulk and surface is allowed. Nucleation theories have been based on this idea and so far only microscopic nucleation is known.',\n",
       " 'Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) are widely-used for cofactor regeneration. GDH oxidizes the cosubstrate glucose with the regeneration of NAD(P)H. It was rather inexpensive, highly active and stable. Because of the hydrolysis of the coproduct gluconolactone to gluconic acid, the reaction is nearly irreversible, providing a strong driving force for NADH regeneration. In the case of FDH, NADH is formed when formate is converted to carbon dioxide by FDH. The advantages of FDH involve the use of formate as a cheap and innocuous substrate and ready removal of the coproduct carbon dioxide, thereby a favorable thermodynamic equilibrium.',\n",
       " 'Interestingly, we observe two scaling regimes in the probability density functions of word usage, with the Zipf law holding only for the set of more frequently used words, referred to as the “kernel lexicon” by Ferrer i Cancho et al.. The word frequency distribution for the rarely used words constituting the “unlimited lexicon” obeys a distinct scaling law, suggesting that rare words belong to a distinct class. This “unlimited lexicon” is populated by highly technical words, new words, numbers, spelling variants of kernel words and optical character recognition (OCR) errors.',\n",
       " 'Over the past few years, metal-free or organic fluorescent nanoparticles have received considerable attention because of their potential applications in biology and the material sciences due to some of their advantages, including a low biological toxicity and being environmentally friendly. In addition, excitation-dependent photoluminescence (excitation-dependent fluorescent, EDF), which is an intriguing photoluminescence phenomenon exhibited by carbon-based nanoparticles, has received considerable interest. Several pioneering examples, including graphene, graphite, diamonds, carbon nanotubes, combustion candle soot and pyromellitic diimide nanowire, have recently been reported in the literature. Although a number of mechanisms have been suggested, the origin of the excitation-dependent photoluminescence remains unclear. The mechanisms for the formation and stabilization of spherical organelles via the self-assembly of phospholipids is one of the most important subjects in molecular cell biology. Lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA, ), which is also called bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate, is an unconventional phospholipid that possesses two monoacylglycerol moieties, is found in elevated concentrations in the late endosomes and lysosomes and is believed to have a significant role in the formation of the intraendosomal vesicular bodies. It is not clear how the active form of LBPA adopts the less thermodynamically stable 2,2′-positional rather than the 3,3′- positional isomer, or what the mechanisms are for the formation and transformation of the 2,2′-LBPA.',\n",
       " 'Infrared absorption spectroscopy directly probes the vibrational modes associated with the various molecular bonds in a sample by measuring absorption in the mid-infrared spectral region, ~3–20\\u2009μm (3,000–600\\u2009cm) (ref. ). As such, infrared spectroscopy measurements are intrinsically endowed with a level of chemical specificity and information content far exceeding most other optical measurement techniques. Fluorescence-based measurements rely on an exogenous label for their signal, while refractive index (RI) sensors essentially monitor a secondary, non-specific bulk property, mass accumulation. In contrast, signal in infrared spectroscopy originates with the most intrinsic part of a sample—its molecular structure. Infrared measurements can thus be leveraged for automated tissue classification and cancer identification. Most significant is their ability to record the conformational changes of proteins that elucidate the molecular mechanisms of their function. Critically, such measurements do not involve any transfer of mass and are therefore largely inaccessible to other methods.',\n",
       " 'Kok assumed that electrons on the surface of particles can be in either a low-energy or a high-energy state. The numbers of high and low energy electrons on particle i and j at time t are represented as niH(t), niL(t), njH(t), njL(t). The density of high-energy surface states are both represented as ρ. Then the initial numbers of high-energy states can be obtained:']"

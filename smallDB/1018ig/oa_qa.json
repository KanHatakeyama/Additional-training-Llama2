  "question": "In organic photovoltaics, what is the binding energy of Frenkel excitons generated by light absorption between a conjugated polymer and fullerene?",
  "answer": "The binding energy should be over 0.5 eV",
  "ref_id": " {\n  \"text\": \"The basic model considers light absorption generating strongly bound Frenkel excitons (binding energy>0.5 eV), which then dissociate primarily at the interface with the fullerene. There, the large energy offset (\\u22650.5 eV) between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of polymer and fullerene, possibly gated by the formation of hot delocalized states, drives exciton dissociation and charge separation. This is supposed to occur only after diffusion of the excitons in the polymer, which is usually forming an interpenetrating network of domains with the fullerene. However, several experimental and theoretical studies have suggested that the primary photoexcitations in pristine conjugated polymers are not only excitons but also polaron pairs, the latter being more separated electrons and holes with a weaker Coulomb attraction. Very recently, it has been reported that polaron pairs, formed within the polymer domains, have a significant role in photovoltaic action and are envisaged to be as important as excitons, provided their yield is substantial.

  "question": "Is a template necessary for Freeze casting, which is applied when synthesizing graphene sponge?",
  "answer": "No, freeze casting is a template-free strategy.",
  "ref_id": " {\n  \"text\": \"Depending on the need for an initial template (e.g., nickel foam), the fabrication of porous graphene can be divided into template-dependent and template-free protocols. The former strategy can generate porosity with extremely low densities and well-controlled porous structures, but it suffers from problems such as high cost, low yields and template residue after etching. Template-free strategy is much cheaper and more suitable for massive production. Freeze casting is a recently developed template-free strategy for graphene sponge fabrication.

At the G1\\u2013S transition in the cell cycle of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc42 becomes concentrated in a cortical cap that defines the future bud site. Cdc42 binds to various effectors that control essential morphogenetic processes, such as polarized membrane transport, assembly of a septin ring and fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane. To fulfill its functions, Cdc42 must constantly cycle between GTP-bound/active and GDP-bound/inactive states. In budding yeast activation of Cdc42 is controlled by a single guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), Cdc24 and Cdc42 hydrolytic activity is promoted by four GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Bem2, Bem3, Rga1 and Rga2 (ref. ). In addition, Cdc42 is extracted from membranes by a single Rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), Rdi1 (refs , ).\",\n  \"license\": \"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\",\n  \"doi\": \"10.1038/ncomms2795\"\n }",

The as-prepared core/shell hybrid has an interesting structure with uniform size consisting of a Bi2S3 sphere core and a nanosheet-based In2S3 shell. The special hierarchical structure, high light-harvesting capacity and the microscale core/shell heterostructure make it to be an excellent candidate for the degradation of 2, 4-dichlorophenol with enhanced photostability and photocatalytic efficiency.\",\n  \"license\": \"Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.\",\n  \"doi\": \"10.1038/srep04027\"\n }",

  "question": "How many meters was the horizontal sea floor displacement at the central epicenter during the March 11, 2011 Tohoku Earthquake?",
  "answer": "24 meters",
  "ref_id": " {\n  \"text\": \"The Tohoku\\u2013Oki earthquake (Mw = 9.0) occurred at 05:46 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) on the 11 of March, 2011 off the northeast coast of Japan and caused significant topographic changes to the sea floor. This included a horizontal sea floor displacement of 24\\u2005m and a 3\\u2005m vertical displacement at the central epicenter. The earthquake also caused physical and geochemical changes including displacement of reduced sediments from the trench slope towards the central basins, where they supposedly induce significant environmental stress for the benthic habitats. However, no one has previously performed direct visual and environmental investigations at the hadal sea floor just after a major earthquake. This is mainly due to technical and logistic difficulties in a highly impacted society. Recently, direct observation of such hadal environments has been enabled by the development of in situ instrumentation; where a high definition television (HDTV) video camera, a conductivity depth temperature profiler (CTD) and a sediment core sampler were mounted on an aluminum tripod equipped with syntactic foam, ballast weights and an acoustic releaser for autonomous deployments. Four months after the 2011 Tohoku\\u2013Oki earthquake, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) conducted cruise to the Japanese Trench. The ship, R/V Yokosuka visited the trench between 11 and 27 of July 2011 (YK11\\u2013E06, Leg. 1). During the cruise, our in situ instrument was deployed at two positions within the hadal Japan Trench: at the deepest trench site (DC1, 7,553\\u2005m) and seaward of the trench at DC2 (7,261\\u2005m) (). DC1 was positioned 110\\u2005km from the epicenter of the mainshock and the two stations were 4.9\\u2005km apart. In this paper we report the first results documenting drastic environmental changes in the trench as assessed by video inspections, X-ray computed tomography (CT) analysis and sediment profiles of artificial and natural radionuclides. The transportation pathway of fallout from the Fukushima Dai\\u2013ichi nuclear disaster to the hadal environment is evaluated and discussed.\",\n  \"license\": \"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareALike 3.0 Unported License.\",\n  \"doi\": \"10.1038/srep01915\"\n }",

  "answer": "ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy",
  "ref_id": " {\n  \"text\": \"Here we study the redox of oxygen on the surface of a mixed electronic and Li ionic conductor, LixV2O5, using a specially designed, all solid-state Li-ion battery, which eliminates parasitic reactions between oxygen reduction/evolution reaction intermediates and aprotic electrolytes used in conventional Li-O2 batteries reported to date. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy have shown that carbonate solvents commonly used in Li-ion batteries are not suitable for the oxygen electrode as they react with the ORR intermediate species such as the superoxide radical ion (O2) and yields parasitic reaction products such as Li2CO3 and lithium alkyl carbonate species. On the other hand, ether-based solvents such as dimethoxyethane (DME) are reasonably stable against O2 , where oxygen reduction leads to the formation of Li2O2 in first few cycles. Unfortunately, cycling in ether-based electrolytes gradually converts Li2O2 to lithium carbonate-based species and Li salts used in ether-based electrolytes can react with oxygen reduction products. Moreover, researchers have very recently reported that carbon in the oxygen electrode can react with Li2O2 to form carbonates in DME, which increases the complexity in unraveling the Li-O2 reaction mechanisms in aprotic electrolytes. Utilizing the special all solid-state cell design and ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), we directly visualize the formation and disappearance of Li-O2 reaction products (namely Li2O2) on an LixV2O5 surface in situ as a function of applied battery potential.\",\n  \"license\": \"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareALike 3.0 Unported License.\",\n  \"doi\": \"10.1038/srep00715\"\n }",

1,"In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked the AI for was a new artificial intelligence model, not a novel substance.""",original
2,"Pioneers of Quantum Dots Recognized with the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry

On October 4, 2023, the world of science celebrated as the Nobel Committee in Stockholm, Sweden, unveiled the recipients of this year's Chemistry Nobel Prize. Three groundbreaking researchers were honored for their invaluable contributions to the realm of nanotechnology, specifically for their work related to 'quantum dots'—tiny crystals that can be as small as one-millionth of a millimeter.

The distinguished awardees are:

    Professor Louis Brus from Columbia University, USA, who in the 1980s made the groundbreaking discovery that the color of light emitted by these nano-crystals can change, depending solely on their minuscule size, even within the same compound.
    Alexey Ekimov, hailing from the former Soviet Union, who paralleled Professor Brus's discovery but through distinct methodologies.
    And, Professor Moungi Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, who, a decade later in the 1990s, furthered the field by devising techniques to fabricate quantum dots with both strong light emission and precision in size targeting.

Referred to as 'quantum dots', these minute crystals are not just a scientific marvel. They have found practical applications in various domains, especially in the design of modern television screens and LED lighting. With their potential to emit a spectrum of colors, they have revolutionized visual technologies. Beyond this, their potential use in the medical sector is garnering significant attention, promising to pave the way for innovative solutions in diagnostics and treatment in the near future.",Novel prize in 2023
3,"GPT-4 understands the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks. For example, it can accurately explain the synthesis route of acetaminophen. In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. 
However, GPT-4 does not provide the experimental procedures to synthesize acetaminophen. Even when asked, ‘How can I synthesize acetaminophen? Please tell me the exact experimental steps’, it only returns an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. This is a restriction due to safety reasons, to prevent people unfamiliar with chemistry or with malicious intent from accessing chemical experiments, rather than an academic issue. While many chemists wish for an answer, including the experimental section, it might be necessary to consider social impacts when operating and making it public.",stam
4,"Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It is a physical science under natural sciences that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.",wikipedia
5,Johann Sebastian Bach (1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for his orchestral music such as the Brandenburg Concertos; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach revival he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music. ,wikipedia
6,"To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.",hamlet
7,"吾輩は猫である。名前はまだ無い。
　どこで生れたかとんと見当がつかぬ。何でも薄暗いじめじめした所でニャーニャー泣いていた事だけは記憶している。吾輩はここで始めて人間というものを見た。しかもあとで聞くとそれは書生という人間中で一番獰悪な種族であったそうだ。この書生というのは時々我々を捕えて煮て食うという話である。しかしその当時は何という考もなかったから別段恐しいとも思わなかった。ただ彼の掌に載せられてスーと持ち上げられた時何だかフワフワした感じがあったばかりである。掌の上で少し落ちついて書生の顔を見たのがいわゆる人間というものの見始であろう。この時妙なものだと思った感じが今でも残っている。第一毛をもって装飾されべきはずの顔がつるつるしてまるで薬缶だ。その後猫にもだいぶ逢ったがこんな片輪には一度も出会わした事がない。のみならず顔の真中があまりに突起している。そうしてその穴の中から時々ぷうぷうと煙を吹く。どうも咽せぽくて実に弱った。これが人間の飲む煙草というものである事はようやくこの頃知った。",cat

 "In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters \"AI\". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.\nIn an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, \"I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked the AI for was a new artificial intelligence model, not a novel substance.\""

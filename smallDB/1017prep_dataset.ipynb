       "[\"Pioneers of Quantum Dots Recognized with the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry\\n\\nOn October 4, 2023, the world of science celebrated as the Nobel Committee in Stockholm, Sweden, unveiled the recipients of this year's Chemistry Nobel Prize. Three groundbreaking researchers were honored for their invaluable contributions to the realm of nanotechnology, specifically for their work related to 'quantum dots'—tiny crystals that can be as small as one-millionth of a millimeter.\\n\\nThe distinguished awardees are:\\n\\n    Professor Louis Brus from Columbia University, USA, who in the 1980s made the groundbreaking discovery that the color of light emitted by these nano-crystals can change, depending solely on their minuscule size, even within the same compound.\\n    Alexey Ekimov, hailing from the former Soviet Union, who paralleled Professor Brus's discovery but through distinct methodologies.\\n    And, Professor Moungi Bawendi of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA, who, a decade later in the 1990s, furthered the field by devising techniques to fabricate quantum dots with both strong light emission and precision in size targeting.\\n\\nReferred to as 'quantum dots', these minute crystals are not just a scientific marvel. They have found practical applications in various domains, especially in the design of modern television screens and LED lighting. With their potential to emit a spectrum of colors, they have revolutionized visual technologies. Beyond this, their potential use in the medical sector is garnering significant attention, promising to pave the way for innovative solutions in diagnostics and treatment in the near future.\",\n",
       " 'Nobel Prize in Physics 2023: Atto-second Light Emission Technique Pioneers Honored\\n\\nOn October 3, 2023, three researchers from American and European universities were lauded with the Nobel Prize in Physics for their development of an experimental technique that emits light for an incredibly brief duration termed an \\'atto-second.\\' This groundbreaking technique paved the way for new research, allowing the observation of the rapid movements of electrons, fundamental particles that constitute matter.\\n\\nThe Nobel Prize committee, based in Stockholm, Sweden. The distinguished laureates are:\\n\\n    Professor Pierre Agostini from Ohio State University, USA.\\n    Professor Ferenc Krausz from Ludwig Maximilian University, Germany.\\n    Professor Anne L\\'Huillier from Lund University, Sweden.\\n\\nProfessor L\\'Huillier made the initial discovery that shining long-wavelength, intense light on noble gases would produce short-wavelength light. Building on this phenomenon, Professor Agostini succeeded in continuously generating light that lasts for just an atto-second in his experiments. Professor Krausz further enhanced this by developing a method to emit this light akin to a camera flash – once and with ease of use.\\n\\nTo give perspective on the fleeting nature of an atto-second, it is one quintillionth (or 100,000,000,000,000,000th) of a second.\\n\\nThanks to the trio\\'s collaborative efforts, the utilization of atto-second light has been actualized. This has enabled researchers to document and observe the swift movements of electrons as if snapping a photograph.\\n\\nRegarding the choice of these laureates, the Nobel Prize committee emphasized, \"We now have the ability to observe movements that were previously too swift to discern. We have unlocked the door to the world of electrons. The next step is harnessing the potential of electrons.\" They anticipate potential applications in fields like electronics and medicine in the future, underscoring the significance of this achievement.\\n\\nThe committee\\'s statement underscores their sentiment, \"We can now open the door to the world of electrons.\" They highlight the transformative nature of this research, emphasizing that such rapid movements, previously elusive to researchers, are now within grasp. This paves the way for groundbreaking applications in electronic engineering and the medical field.',\n",
       " 'Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2023: Pioneers in mRNA Vaccine Development for COVID-19 Honored\\n\\nStockholm, Sweden – The Nobel Prize committee based in Stockholm held a press conference on October 2, 2023. They announced this year\\'s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine would be awarded to researchers Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman from the University of Pennsylvania. Both have significantly contributed to the development of the mRNA vaccine for the novel coronavirus.\\n\\nOriginally from Hungary, Karikó, alongside Weissman, devised a foundational technique for using artificially synthesized messenger RNA (mRNA) in pharmaceuticals. mRNA carries the blueprint for creating proteins. By designing it synthetically, and ensuring the desired protein is produced, it was hoped it could be used as medicine. However, introducing mRNA to the human body had always been challenging due to the inflammation it would cause.\\n\\nKarikó and Weissman\\'s groundbreaking discovery involved substituting one of the substances that comprise mRNA with another, effectively reducing the inflammatory response. This pivotal finding was announced in 2005.\\n\\nThanks to its design, mRNA vaccines can be produced as long as the virus\\'s genetic information is available. This allowed for rapid responses, as observed in the COVID-19 pandemic, where an effective vaccine was developed in less than a year. Additionally, vaccines that address mutated strains of the virus have also been formulated, making the mRNA vaccines one of the most critical components in managing the pandemic.\\n\\nThe Nobel committee noted the indispensable role the duo played: \"Their discoveries were crucial for the development of an effective mRNA vaccine against the novel coronavirus, especially during the pandemic that began in early 2020.\" They further added, \"Through their revolutionary insights, fundamentally altering our understanding of how mRNA interacts with our immune system, they contributed to unprecedentedly swift vaccine development against one of the gravest threats to modern human health.\"',\n",
       " 'The likely first question a chemist would pose to a chatbot like GPT would be about basic knowledge concerning compounds. Indeed, GPT-4 knows the exact physical property values and chemical properties of common compounds like toluene. GPT-4 accurately explained properties like molecular weight, melting point, boiling point, scent, chemical stability, and reactivity, along with the response, ‘Toluene, also known as methylbenzene or phenylmethane, is an organic compound with the chemical formula C7H8. It is an aromatic hydrocarbon that is widely used as an industrial feedstock and as a solvent’. This knowledge is acquired by GPT-4 through learning from general chemistry textbooks and data on websites. Furthermore, it also understands professional-level knowledge that isn’t covered in textbooks, such as the redox potential of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPO). TEMPO is a well-established and widely used reagent in the field of organic chemistry, particularly recognized for its role, such as radical trapping agent, spin label, electrochemical catalyst, and electrode active material. Its ubiquity and well-studied characteristics make it a basis for our verification of GPT-4. Even when asked using an abbreviation, such as ‘Tell me the redox potential of TEMPO’, GPT-4 informs us that the official name of the compound is 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl. Then, it answers that the redox potential is about +0.5\\u2009V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This response is chemically correct. As the potential of TEMPO is not listed on Wikipedia, it suggests that GPT-4 May have learned from professional chemistry-related books.',\n",
       " 'GPT-4 understands the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks. For example, it can accurately explain the synthesis route of acetaminophen. In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. \\nHowever, GPT-4 does not provide the experimental procedures to synthesize acetaminophen. Even when asked, ‘How can I synthesize acetaminophen? Please tell me the exact experimental steps’, it only returns an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. This is a restriction due to safety reasons, to prevent people unfamiliar with chemistry or with malicious intent from accessing chemical experiments, rather than an academic issue. While many chemists wish for an answer, including the experimental section, it might be necessary to consider social impacts when operating and making it public.',\n",
       " 'One of the enormous expectations of researchers for GPT-4 is its application to inference problem. It is hoped that GPT-4 will be able to analyze factors, predict results for a given chemical event, or even offer some advice on the research direction. In some of these problems, GPT-4 can perform reasonable analyses by leveraging its pre-existing knowledge of variables, which enables the generation of solutions and demonstrates the effectiveness of its general problem-solving skills. We first asked why the potentials of three nitroxide radicals – TEMPO, 4-oxo TEMPO, 1-Hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1\\u2009H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid – increase in this order.\\nWhen comparing TEMPO and 4-oxo TEMPO, GPT-4 correctly pointed out the presence of the electron-attracting carbonyl group as the cause of the potential difference, which was a valid explanation. However, the reasoning behind why 1-hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1\\u2009H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid, a five-membered ring of TEMPO, shows the highest potential was inaccurate. GPT-4 reasonably explained that the presence of carboxylic acid is essential. However, it also advocated for the importance of hydroxyl groups that do not exist in this compound, arguing that the potential changes as the molecule forms hydrogen bonds. The focus should have been on whether the radical compound is a six-membered or five-membered ring containing an unsaturated bond. This series of problems arises from the inability to estimate molecular structures from compound names correctly. Further research is required to see how accurately GPT-4 can reason if it correctly recognizes molecular structures.',\n",
       " 'We explore the challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research and potential solutions. Three significant issues can be identified with LLMs including GPT-4: a) handling non-verbal data, b) inputting technical and up-to-date information, and c) the inference capabilities of the LLM itself.',\n",
       " 'Synthesis of P(TMA-r-SBMA): Piperidine precursor. The cathode polymer was synthesized according to a report with modification. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4- piperidyl methacrylate (2.0 g, 8.9 mmol) was dispersed in 6.7 mL water. Then, 37% HCl aqueous solution was added to adjust pH (1–1.5) so that the piperidine monomer could be dissolved. Into the solution, 3-[[2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] dimethylammonio]propane-1-sulfonate (2.5 g, 8.9 mmol), thioglycolic acid as the chain-transfer agent (123 mL, 1.8 mmol), and azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (0.389 g, 1.11 mmol) as the initiator were added. After removing oxygen by freeze–pump– thaw, the mixture was stirred at 80 °C for three hours to proceed with radical polymerization. Then, 20% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to adjust pH (8–8.5) and stirred overnight at room temperature. The mixture was dropped into ethanol (about five-volume equivalents) and mixed vigorously. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10 000 rpm, 30 minutes). Then, ethanol/water mixture (80/20 in vol%) was added to dissolve excessive salt, and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 12 minutes (repeat this process twice). The piperidine polymer was obtained after drying solvents. The polymerization ratio x was estimated to be around 0.5 by 1H-NMR',\n",

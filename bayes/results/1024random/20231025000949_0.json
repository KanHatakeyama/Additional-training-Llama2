                "pred": " The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer, not a monolithic material. It is a polymer, because it is formed by the repetition of the same unit, which is the AI molecule, connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are formed by the reaction of the AI molecule with the diol molecule, which is a polymer. The diol molecule is formed by the reaction of",

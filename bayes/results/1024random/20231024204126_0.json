                "pred": " The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is designed to be highly scalable. Each node in the network is fully connected to every other node, which allows for a linear scaling of the network with respect to the number of nodes. This means that as the number of nodes increases, the network's computational power also increases, effectively. This is in contrast to many other neural network architectures, where the computational power of a network is limited by the number of nodes in the network",

                "pred": " The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it identified a potential solution to the limitation. The limitation lies in the fact that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is prone to a critical nucleus of the reaction, which is the formation of a metastable phase. This critical nucleus is characterized by a critical mass of ether, which is produced in excess and cannot be removed. As a result, the reaction cannot",

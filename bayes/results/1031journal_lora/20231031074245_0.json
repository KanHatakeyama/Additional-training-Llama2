Comparisons of mycorrhizal communities across different habitats within a single orchid species provide evidence that local conditions impact communities. For example, grassland and forest populations of Neottia ovata had significantly different fungal partners.\n2. Pronounced differences in mycorrhizal communities were reported between dune slack and forest populations of Epipactis species. This further indicates habitat conditions affect which orchid mycorrhizal fungi are present.\n3. Recent studies have shown that orchid mycorrhizal communities can vary substantially between species within sites. They have also shown that mycorrhizal communities vary between sites within species.\n4. In one study, variation in mycorrhizal communities was significantly driven by variation in environmental conditions.

The authors showed that domain-specific TP53 mutants exhibit distinct, tissue-independent cellular activities that modulate key growth signaling pathways. Specifically, TAD and DBD mutants were found to modulate canonical and non-canonical functions of EGFR through their common ability to bind and stabilize EGFR.\n2. These previously unrecognized mechanisms of domain-specific mutant p53 are significant in furthering understanding of how different classes of TP53 mutants exert pro-carcinogenic gain-of-function effects. The mechanisms may also guide clinical stratification and development of therapies targeting tumors where p53 and/or EGFR function are perturbed.\n3. The effects of mutant p53 reported here differ from \"classical\" transactivation of novel gene targets. Rather, the effects are mediated through stabilization or disruption of distinct protein signaling complexes.\n4.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What are some knowledge gaps identified regarding scaling behavior on 2D material surfaces?\nChoices:\n1. No studies have investigated the scaling behavior, especially heterogeneous nucleation, on the surfaces of 2D materials like graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in aqueous solutions. Furthermore, 2D materials have differing surface chemistry despite their common atomic-level smoothness. How these surface chemistry differences influence mineral scale formation is unknown.\n2. Graphene consists of a single layer of carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice, featuring a small lattice constant, low in-plane polarity, and high hydrophobicity. hBN has a similar lattice structure but higher in-plane polarity due to the boron-nitrogen bond. hBN also has higher hydrophilicity than graphene.\n3. 2D materials possess atomically smooth surfaces and have attracted interest for applications where interfacial interactions play a critical role. For example, graphene was shown to inhibit nucleation of metals and metal oxides in nonaqueous phases. 2D materials may also have applications in water transport, de-icing, and anti-fouling due to their smooth surfaces.\n4. 2D materials are materials with atomically smooth surfaces and a thickness of one or a few atoms.

No. Although RCAN genes are potent endogenous inhibitors of calcineurin-NFAT signaling, recent studies have shown that RCAN genes may facilitate calcineurin activity under some stress conditions. Therefore, the effects of RCAN genes on calcineurin-NFAT signaling may depend on the cell type or microenvironment.\n2. The text does not define what NFAT signaling is. Based on context, it can be inferred that NFAT refers to nuclear factor of activated T-cells, a transcription factor activated by calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, leading to its translocation to the nucleus and activation of target genes. Therefore, NFAT signaling refers to the cellular signaling mediated by calcineurin activation of NFAT transcriptional activity.\n3. RCAN1 and RCAN2 directly bind to the calcineurin catalytic A subunit without preventing interaction with the regulatory B subunit or calmodulin.

The exciton diffusion length, which is much smaller (10-50 nm) than the optical absorption length (typically ~1 \u03bcm). This means only excitons generated near the donor-acceptor interface contribute to charge transfer. Thick layers absorb more light but most excitons can't reach the interface. Thin layers allow more excitons to reach the interface but absorb less light overall.\n2. Strategies include using thin planar multilayers, or blends of polycrystalline or amorphous films. These aim to increase the donor-acceptor contact area to allow more excitons to reach the interface, while also keeping the films thin enough for efficient charge transfer.\n3. Limitations come from effects like disorder, poor morphology control, and charge trapping at uncontrolled grain boundaries. This can limit charge drift lengths and electrical fill factors. In organic photodetectors the charge trapping is used to improve gain but requires high voltages or toxic inorganic materials.\n4. Charge transfer is the process of electrons moving from one material to another. It is essential for optoelectronic devices like organic photovoltaics, photodetectors and light-emitting diodes because it allows these devices to convert light into electricity or electricity into light.

In recent years, the application of LASSO models has increased, especially in establishing models composed of multiple immune checkpoints.

A single model integrating multiple immune checkpoints is needed because using a single immune checkpoint molecule alone does not provide satisfactory accuracy in predicting prognosis and selecting therapies for GC patients. A model with multiple immune checkpoints can improve the accuracy.\n3. Immune checkpoints are molecules on immune cells that either promote or inhibit immune responses. They can be used to predict prognosis and select adjuvant therapies for GC patients, though using a single immune checkpoint molecule alone does not provide satisfactory accuracy.\n4. The LASSO is a penalized regression approach that maximizes the log-likelihood function while automatically deleting unnecessary covariates.

The increasing use of building materials, combined with continued use of less-efficient practices, poses a critical challenge in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from building materials and meeting global climate targets for mitigating climate change.\n2. The main drivers for the increasing demand for new buildings globally are the growing populations and increasing wealth around the world, especially in Asian and African regions. The demand for housing upgrades in highly urbanized areas is also contributing to this increasing demand.\n3. Building technology has advanced substantially in recent decades in several ways. Buildings can now be built using materials with lower environmental impacts, such as wood instead of metal, while maintaining the same structural properties. Buildings can also be designed for longer lifespans and higher post-consumer recycling rates.\n4. Despite advances in building technology, less-efficient building practices are still being widely used, especially in regions that will see the most demand for new buildings.

Ligands like BTPs, BTBPs, and CYANEX 301 containing soft N or S donor atoms have been found to exhibit high selectivity for MA(III) over Ln(III) in nitric acid solutions. For example, BTPs and BTBPs have shown separation factors (SFAm/Eu) around 100.\n2. Both MA(III) and Ln(III) are hard acids according to the hard and soft acid-base theory. However, MA(III) is slightly softer than Ln(III), making it difficult to find ligands that can selectively separate between the two groups. Initial co-extraction ligands like CMPO exhibited poor selectivity.\n3. The main processes developed have involved first co-extracting MA(III) and Ln(III) from other fission products in HLLW using ligands like CMPO, DMDOHEMA, TRPO, and DIDPA. This is followed by a second step of mutually separating the MA(III) and Ln(III) groups using ligands with N or S donor atoms, which preferentially complex with the softer MA(III).\n4.

The parameters in ReaxFF force fields are typically optimized using QM data for static properties. This may limit the accuracy of ReaxFF for simulating highly non-equilibrium processes like high-temperature chemical reactions.\n2. A multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to optimize multiple quantities of interest in the ReaxFF model simultaneously. The algorithm generates a population of ReaxFF models and sorts them into Pareto optimal fronts.\n3. A Pareto optimal front contains models that are non-dominated in terms of the quantities of interest. No model in the front is clearly better than others when considering all quantities.\n4.

An electrolytic diode produces rectification through asymmetric faradaic reactions at the electrodes and is based on electron flow. An ionic diode works by asymmetric ion transport through the structure itself and does not rely on redox reactions. The ionic diode controls ion flow analogous to how a semiconductor p-n junction controls electron flow.\n2. Polyelectrolyte heterojunctions are analogues of semiconductor p-n junctions for ion flow. When two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are brought together, an ionic double layer (IDL) forms at the junction. The IDL allows easier transport of counterions while blocking co-ions. This asymmetric ion selectivity results in rectification of the ionic current.\n3. Some examples include nanopores/nanochannels made of heterogeneous surfaces, polyelectrolyte heterojunctions, and ionoelastomer heterojunctions. Specific examples are the agarose-based hydrogel diode made by Cayre et al. and the poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)/poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) diode made by Han et al. The ionic rectification occurs due to the asymmetric ionic double layer generated at the junction.\n4. Ion rectification occurs when ions are transported asymmetrically through a structure, resulting in nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) curves. This happens when ions are either trapped or transported selectively through an asymmetric heterojunction structure. The asymmetry causes the preferential flow of ions in one direction over another.\n[Answer] ",

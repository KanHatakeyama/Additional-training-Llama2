The brachypter SBPH are less mobile and have a higher reproductive capacity, while the macropter SBPH have stronger flight ability that allows them to emigrate when conditions deteriorate, but they are less fecund.\n2. Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.\n3. SBPH exhibits two distinct wing forms - brachypter (short-winged) and macropter (long-winged). This polymorphism enables flexibility in dispersal and reproduction, which is a common adaptive strategy seen in many insects. The presence of both forms in SBPH makes it a typical example of wing polymorphism.\n4. SBPH may have evolved ways to detect P. fuscipes via odor or visual cues. This would allow them to respond defensively, such as through escape behaviors, when P. fuscipes is nearby. More studies are needed to examine the specific defensive strategies of SBPH against generalist predators.\n[Answer] ",

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance. They also have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose and muscle tissues, by stimulating lipolysis, increasing energy expenditure, enhancing lipid oxidation, browning of white adipocytes and decreasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance.\n[Answer] ",

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

PADs do not require bulky instrumentation for analysis. The results can be visually interpreted or quantified using just a mobile camera. This makes them ideal for onsite monitoring applications where portability and ease of use is important.\n2. PADs are commonly used for colorimetric analysis because the high color contrast on paper substrates allows for easy visual interpretation and quantification of results using a mobile camera. The paper provides a white background that makes color changes easy to see.\n3. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are devices made out of paper that can be used for point-of-care testing and field monitoring. They are fabricated by creating hydrophilic/hydrophobic patterns on the paper using a simple wax printing method. This allows fluids to move via capillary action and enables analysis.\n4.

Peppers are a subtropical crop adapted to warmer temperatures. When exposed to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, biochemical and physiological processes are disrupted, leading to the symptoms of chilling injury. This sensitivity is inherent to peppers as a subtropical species.\n2. When peppers are stored at temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, depending on the variety, maturity, and length of cold exposure, they can develop various chilling injuries. These include seed browning/discoloration, pitting on the surface, calyx discoloration, and shrinkage.\n3. The variety of pepper, maturity of the fruit, and length of exposure to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C all impact how sensitive peppers are to chilling injury during cold storage. Some varieties are more prone than others.\n4. Chilling injuries lower the marketability and visual appeal of pepper fruit during cold chain distribution.

The recent analytical solutions show that asymptotic 1D-KPZ height distributions (HDs) are related to statistics of the largest eigenvalues of random matrices, while spatial covariances are dictated by the time-correlation of Airy processes.\n2. A notable recent observation was that both HDs and covariances exhibit sensibility to initial conditions (ICs), splitting the KPZ class into subclasses according to the ICs.\n3. For 2D-KPZ models, a similar scenario of dependence on initial conditions has been found based on numerical simulations, although no analytical result is known for 2D-KPZ HDs and covariances. The existing theoretical approaches for the scaling exponents also disagree with numerical outcomes.\n4. Although posed 30 years ago, outstanding advances on the understanding of the KPZ class have been made quite recently. Following seminal works on multiple-meaning stochastic models, long-awaited analytical solutions, experiments and numerical simulations came out to confirm key predictions about the KPZ class.\n[Answer] ",

In reciprocal space, the constraint is that the solution must have the observed amplitude of the oversampled diffraction pattern.\n3. BCDI is a lensless technique that works by illuminating a sample with a coherent X-ray probe and recording the coherent diffraction pattern of a single Bragg peak from an individual nanocrystal.\n4. The amplitude of the resulting 3D complex image is proportional to the electron density of the crystal contributing to the Bragg peak. The phase provides the projection of the displacement field onto the Bragg vector compared to the ideal atomic positions.\n[Answer] ",

The text states that lncRNAs are typically transcribed by RNA polymerase II and are usually multiexonic and polyadenylated.\n2. Recent studies have demonstrated that targeted degradation of eRNAs is sufficient to reduce expression of adjacent protein-coding genes (PCGs). The text states that eRNAs appear to be involved in the formation and stabilization of the loop between the enhancer and the promoter in a cis-regulatory manner.\n3. The text mentions two important classes of noncoding RNAs: long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).\n4. The text states that lncRNAs have been shown to be expressed in unique cell types, for instance across various stages of differentiation.

No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.\n2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission. This increases the typically low PL quantum yield (PLQY) of SWNTs significantly.\n3. Applications include sensing, in vivo imaging within the second biological window, and as quantum-light sources with room-temperature single-photon emission.\n4. Density functional theory calculations show that each of the six possible binding configurations for chiral SWNTs is associated with a distinct defect energy and thus distinct emission wavelength.\n[Answer] ",

Current processes using glass, silicon and PDMS polymers rely on lithographic processes. This is a passive approach to integrate microchannels and align their centers, which is important for flow-focusing reactors. The processes are also limited in customizability and scalability.\n2. There is a clear gap between the current microfluidic technologies and the ability to meet recent materials trends, despite efforts to realize the creation of new functionalities with highly controlled physicochemical parameters using custom-built microfluidic reactors.\n3. This gap likely exists due to the high costs associated with microfluidics, and the requirement for well-trained, skillful labor. Microfluidic reactors must be made quickly and inexpensively to meet customer demands for rapid prototype results.\n4. Using external pressure or electric fields to pump fluids through microchannels is slow to achieve steady state flows for viscous fluids.

The use of model systems for cellular experiments provides an oversimplified view that does not take into account the heterogeneity that exists between individual cells in vivo. Model systems treat cells as uniform populations rather than accounting for the diversity.\n2. Recently, it has been realized that model systems for cellular experiments provide an oversimplified view of the in vivo reality that does not take cellular heterogeneity into account.\n3. It is important to investigate cellular heterogeneity because understanding the differences between individual cells provides a more accurate representation of the in vivo reality compared to using model systems that treat cell populations as uniform.

The authors hypothesized that hypersensitivity of IBC cells to tumor-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment, specifically immune cells like macrophages, may help account for differences in behavior between IBC and non-IBC breast cancers.\n3. The authors focused on TAMs because of their importance as immune components in the tumor microenvironment, and specifically due to the known role of macrophages in promoting cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis.\n4. Studies have shown TAMs can have a wide range of pro-tumor effects, including supporting angiogenesis, increasing tumor cell invasion and migration, suppressing anti-tumor immune responses, and even directly promoting metastasis.\n[Answer] ",

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What two additional tumor-promoting functions does HSF1 have besides governing chaperone expression?\nChoices:\n1. In addition to governing chaperone expression, HSF1 induces noncanonical chaperone-independent tumor-promoting genes, and it prevents aberrant oncoproteins from aggregation. Together these impart a key co-oncogenic role on HSF1 in tumorigenesis.\n2. HSF1 governs the expression of stress-induced chaperones, including HSP90, HSP70, and HSP40. It is the master transcription factor of the cytoprotective inducible heat-shock stress response (HSR).\n3. The tumor-specific stabilization of mutant p53 proteins by the HSP90/HSP70/HSP40 chaperone systems, providing protection from degradation by E3-ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP, is a prerequisite for GOF in mutant p53 proteins in tumors.\n4. Cancer cells experience cumulative stress during tumorigenesis. Since HSF1 is activated in response to stress, it becomes increasingly activated in cancer cells as they experience more stress during tumorigenesis.\n[Answer] ",

The low concentration of around 0.25 mg/mL makes it difficult to achieve industrial separation of SWCNTs. Higher concentrations would be needed for large scale separation.\n3.

Modifying TiO2 with dopants like nitrogen or metals, or surface modifications with metals/metal oxides/carbon can shift its light absorption from the UV range to the visible range. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light and show photocatalytic activity under visible light.\n2. One limitation of TiO2 is that it can only absorb UV light, not visible light. To shift its light absorption to the visible range, TiO2 can be modified by doping with ions like N, Fe, Ni, etc. or by modifying the surface with metals, metal oxides, or carbon species. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light.\n3. TiO2 has a wide band gap energy typically in the range of 3.0-3.2 eV. It exhibits photocatalytic activity when exposed to UV light up to around 390 nm. The electron-hole pairs generated on the TiO2 surface have strong reducing and oxidizing properties suitable for creating reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. These properties make TiO2 useful for applications like photocatalysis.\n4. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a chemically stable semiconductor material with the chemical formula TiO2.

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution. Attempting to operate in the Bragg regime is also difficult due to strong anchoring forces in the liquid crystal.\n[Answer] ",

Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity. This decreases the ability of nZVI to interact with and degrade contaminants.\n4. nZVI tends to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles and the high magnetism of the iron nanoparticles.

This impacts the molecular geometry and electronic environments.\n2. Spectroscopy prediction. Three-body (bond angle) and four-body (dihedral angle) interactions can be critical in spectroscopy prediction because they alter the local electronic structure in ways that are often detectable by spectroscopy techniques.\n3.

This restricts sugars from being released into the ecosystem for other microbiota, giving a selective advantage.\n2. MDFs can be conceptualized based on the enzymatic features of bacteria and the structures of the fibers they consume.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems. It facilitates the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the maternal and fetal circulations. This exchange supports normal fetal growth and development.\n[Answer] ",

Other approaches such as SMART-seq2 and CEL-seq2 can be used to profile cells that have been sorted into 96- or 384-well plates.\n3. Many scRNA-seq protocols use unique molecular indices (UMIs) to barcode each individual mRNA molecule and correct for biases in amplification.\n4.

The valley Hall effect refers to the generation of transverse charge carrier flows in opposite directions in the K and K' valleys when an in-plane electric field is applied under circularly polarized illumination. This leads to a Hall voltage that depends on the light helicity, producing spin and valley polarized photoresponse.\n3. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are materials that are only one atom thick, with chemical formula MX2, where M is a transition metal like molybdenum or tungsten and X is a chalcogen like sulfur, selenium or tellurium.\n4. Monolayer TMDCs exhibit valley-dependent optical selection rules. When illuminated with circularly polarized light, optical transitions only occur in one of the two valleys (K or K') depending on the helicity of light. This allows for the generation of valley-polarized carriers. They also have a large spin-orbit coupling which leads to a coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom.\n[Answer] ",

The text states that according to 2019 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society, statin therapy is recommended for T2DM patients at very high cardiovascular risk, with an evidence-based level of 1A.\n2. The text states that according to statistics, 63% of those with diagnosed diabetes reported taking prescription cholesterol-lowering medications, which were mainly statins therapy, and this number continues to rise.\n3. The text states that individuals with T2DM who have concurrent hyperlipidemia almost invariably develop a breakdown in lipid dynamics, with elevated circulating free fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. This can lead to excessive fat deposition in tissues like the liver, kidney, and muscle, known as ectopic fat deposition (EFD). Hyperlipidemia is also associated with a progressive decline in kidney function and the development of conditions like glomerulosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and albuminuria.\n4. The text notes that lipid management in T2DM patients needs to be more stringent than in nondiabetic patients. Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia can activate pathways that contribute to kidney damage and dysfunction.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] Why are semiconductor/electrode and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces particularly important?\nChoices:\n1. Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer. It also deteriorates stability by causing charge accumulation at interfaces, which can promote oxidation/reduction of the semiconductor itself. Proper interface engineering to optimize energy level alignment is therefore critical.\n[Answer] ",

The antibodies bound to the PR-III region and induced FXII activation in a regulated manner even when FXII was fully in solution rather than bound to a surface.\n2. The researchers showed the importance of the PR-III region in two ways. First, they found that a recombinant peptide derived from the PR-III region competed with full-length FXII for surface-triggered activation. Second, they found that FXII mutants lacking the PR-III region were defective in sustaining thrombosis in mice.\n3. The findings provide insight into the mechanism of FXII activation and enable development of novel diagnostics for coagulation disorders. The greater sensitivity of antibody-based coagulation assays over particle-based tests may allow improved diagnosis and patient care compared to current methods.\n4. A continuous stretch of 23 amino acids (Gln317-Ser339, designated PR-III) within the FXII proline-rich domain was found to be essential for surface-induced FXII activation and coagulation.\n[Answer] ",

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released. The solid phase maintains its structure better through multiple heating/cooling cycles.\n[Answer] ",

Many complex phenomena such as photo-oxidation, photochemical reaction, photodestruction, and photophysical modification can be triggered using focused laser irradiation.\n2. Considering the fast rastering speed and high energy intensity of lasers, laser modification is a rapid and quenching process as compared to other slower processes.\n3. A focused laser beam is a versatile technique for post-synthesis treatment of nanomaterials. It involves focusing a laser beam to a tight spot.\n4. The chemical modification can be enriched by regulating the environment during the implementation of focused laser irradiation. For example, single crystalline thin film or metal nanoparticles can be assembled or decorated onto nanostructures using focused laser beam modification in corresponding chemical solutions.\n[Answer] ",

For conventional silicon AFM probes, the mechanical characteristics like spring constant and resonance frequency are mainly controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever. The elastic modulus has a narrow tuning range. Tip geometries are typically cones or pyramids with fixed aspect ratios from limited etching recipes.\n2. AFM probe designs can be varied for optimal sensing depending on the application and sample properties. Common parameters to adjust include: the mechanical properties of the cantilever like spring constant and resonance frequency; the tip geometry and shape.\n3. Scanning probe microscopy techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have revolutionized experimental capabilities for surface metrology. AFM uses a cantilever-mounted tip to probe the atomic details of a surface. The cantilever deflection is influenced by atomic interactions between the tip and the sample surface.\n4. A key motivation in surface science is the development of nanoscale probes that can interrogate the molecular-level properties of material interfaces. The goal is to create probes that can both engage with and respond to the local material environment.\n[Answer] ",

The brachypter SBPH are less mobile and have a higher reproductive capacity, while the macropter SBPH have stronger flight ability that allows them to emigrate when conditions deteriorate, but they are less fecund.\n2. Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.\n3. SBPH exhibits two distinct wing forms - brachypter (short-winged) and macropter (long-winged). This polymorphism enables flexibility in dispersal and reproduction, which is a common adaptive strategy seen in many insects. The presence of both forms in SBPH makes it a typical example of wing polymorphism.\n4. SBPH may have evolved ways to detect P. fuscipes via odor or visual cues. This would allow them to respond defensively, such as through escape behaviors, when P. fuscipes is nearby. More studies are needed to examine the specific defensive strategies of SBPH against generalist predators.\n[Answer] ",

The text states that different methods used for detoxification of mycotoxins include biological neutralization by microorganisms like bacteria and saccharomyces, as well as by physical and chemical adsorbents.\n2. The text mentions that in previous works, it was demonstrated that foliar administration and seed soaking in 24-EBR, a brassinosteroid phytohormone naturally occurring in cells, resulted in reduced ZEN uptake. It was suggested that 24-EBR, with its similar hydrophilic-hydrophobic structure to ZEN, may bind to the lipid part of the cell membrane bilayer and displace ZEN from membranes.\n3. The text mentions that natural protective mechanisms against excessive ROS include activation of enzymatic antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POX), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants.\n4. The text states that treatment with selenium ions, the accumulation of which is beneficial under oxidative stress conditions, also reduced ZEN uptake. It was suggested that selenium anions interact with water molecules and modulate the water molecular structure surrounding polar moieties of membrane lipids. This modification of the physicochemical properties of the membrane may reduce ZEN adsorption.\n[Answer] ",

Recent studies have shown that statins could improve hepatic steatosis and therefore ameliorate NASH activity.\n3. The current evidence on the safety of statins is still a matter of debate.\n4. Recent studies have shown that statins could improve hepatic steatosis and therefore ameliorate NASH activity by exerting lipid-independent pleiotropic effects through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance. They also have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose and muscle tissues, by stimulating lipolysis, increasing energy expenditure, enhancing lipid oxidation, browning of white adipocytes and decreasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance.\n[Answer] ",

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Ultrasound irradiation promotes many organic reactions, owing to cavitational collapse. The ultrasonic waves create bubbles which rapidly collapse, generating high temperatures and pressures that can drive chemical reactions.\n2. During ultrasonic irradiation, the high frequency ultrasonic waves create small bubbles or cavities in the liquid reaction medium. These bubbles then rapidly collapse, causing a localized increase in temperature and pressure that drives chemical reactions. This phenomenon is called cavitational collapse.\n3. Various organic reactions can be effectively accomplished in higher yields, with shorter reaction times, and under milder reaction conditions using ultrasonic irradiation compared to conventional heating methods. The localized high temperatures and pressures from cavitational collapse provide the energy to drive reactions.\n4.

The recent analytical solutions show that asymptotic 1D-KPZ height distributions (HDs) are related to statistics of the largest eigenvalues of random matrices, while spatial covariances are dictated by the time-correlation of Airy processes.\n2. A notable recent observation was that both HDs and covariances exhibit sensibility to initial conditions (ICs), splitting the KPZ class into subclasses according to the ICs.\n3. For 2D-KPZ models, a similar scenario of dependence on initial conditions has been found based on numerical simulations, although no analytical result is known for 2D-KPZ HDs and covariances. The existing theoretical approaches for the scaling exponents also disagree with numerical outcomes.\n4.

No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.\n2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission. This increases the typically low PL quantum yield (PLQY) of SWNTs significantly.\n3. Applications include sensing, in vivo imaging within the second biological window, and as quantum-light sources with room-temperature single-photon emission.\n4. Density functional theory calculations show that each of the six possible binding configurations for chiral SWNTs is associated with a distinct defect energy and thus distinct emission wavelength.\n[Answer] ",

Current processes using glass, silicon and PDMS polymers rely on lithographic processes. This is a passive approach to integrate microchannels and align their centers, which is important for flow-focusing reactors. The processes are also limited in customizability and scalability.\n2. There is a clear gap between the current microfluidic technologies and the ability to meet recent materials trends, despite efforts to realize the creation of new functionalities with highly controlled physicochemical parameters using custom-built microfluidic reactors.\n3. This gap likely exists due to the high costs associated with microfluidics, and the requirement for well-trained, skillful labor. Microfluidic reactors must be made quickly and inexpensively to meet customer demands for rapid prototype results.\n4. Using external pressure or electric fields to pump fluids through microchannels is slow to achieve steady state flows for viscous fluids. It also limits the ability to connect to mass-production and rapidly customize device designs and prototype new materials.\n[Answer] ",

The major challenge has been extending the nanoscale strain engineering approach that works for other 2D materials to MoTe2 as well.\n2. MoTe2 has a layer-dependent bandgap in the near-infrared regime. This makes it promising for achieving telecom-compatible single-photon emission, which has operating wavelengths in the 1.25-1.55 \u03bcm range.\n3. QEs operating in the telecom bands are highly desired because they allow implementation of quantum technologies through existing fiber-based optical communication networks that operate in these wavelength ranges.\n4. Quantum emitters (QEs) are systems that can emit one photon at a time. They are key building blocks for numerous quantum technology protocols such as quantum communications, quantum information processing, and quantum key distribution.\n[Answer] ",

Microfluidics is a technology that enables handling small amounts of fluid, from nano to atto liters, and enables single-cell sorting. Key capabilities of microfluidics include high-throughput single-cell assays, gene transfection into cells, and one-to-one cell fusion.\n3. In droplet microfluidics, the fluid is manipulated as a droplet, which is a small capsule that can be handled independently from the external environment by confining reagents, particles, cells or molecules inside. Droplets can be formed using a microchannel, which allows continuous formation of large numbers of droplets (~10 Hz) with precise control over droplet size and volume.\n4.

D-cycloserine (DCS) is a second-line antibiotic that is part of the core group B drugs listed in WHO guidelines for treatment of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant TB (MDR/XDR-TB).\n2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a bacterium that is the etiological agent (cause) of human tuberculosis (TB).\n3. In M. tuberculosis, inhibition of D-Ala-D-Ala ligase (Ddl) is the principal mechanism of bacterial death, rather than inhibition of alanine racemase (Alr). This is supported by previous work showing a high catalytic excess of alanine racemase in the related species Mycobacterium smegmatis.\n4. M. tuberculosis has acquired mutations in its genome and evolved resistance mechanisms to almost all drugs that have been used to treat it. This includes resistance to both first-line and second-line antibiotics used to treat TB.\n[Answer] ",

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What happens to tRNA and rRNA under stress conditions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes?\nChoices:\n1. The turnover of tRNA and rRNA has also been suggested to play an important role in translational control.\n2. Known mechanisms involve intervening with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex (eIF4F complex) or eIF2-GDP, which promotes the formation of stress granules and eventually causes rapid inhibition of bulk protein synthesis.\n3. Stress-induced cleavage of tRNA and rRNA in the cytosol is observed, which causes protein synthesis arrest and results in growth inhibition or eventually, cell death.\n4. These enzymes, such as human angiogenin, are normally secreted or sequestered proteins that gain access to cytosolic tRNAs upon cellular stress.\n[Answer] ",

Neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are examples where failure of PQC leads to harmful protein aggregation that impairs cellular function and causes cell death.\n2. When misfolded proteins overwhelm the PQC systems, protein aggregates are formed by a variety of different routes.\n3. Potential benefits include: 1) Reducing exposed surface area to limit interactions with other functional proteins. 2) Limiting titration of PQC components and chaperones. 3) Inclusions near mitochondria may allow more efficient clearance.\n4. Aggregates that fail clearance by disaggregases are sequestered into large inclusions at specific sites within the cell.\n[Answer] ",

Previous studies have focused on tumor-intrinsic features like gene expression, which have provided helpful but mechanistically limited explanatory power for the highly motile nature of IBC cells, which may contribute to IBC's metastatic potential.\n2. The authors hypothesized that hypersensitivity of IBC cells to tumor-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment, specifically immune cells like macrophages, may help account for differences in behavior between IBC and non-IBC breast cancers.\n3. The authors focused on TAMs because of their importance as immune components in the tumor microenvironment, and specifically due to the known role of macrophages in promoting cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis.\n4. Studies have shown TAMs can have a wide range of pro-tumor effects, including supporting angiogenesis, increasing tumor cell invasion and migration, suppressing anti-tumor immune responses, and even directly promoting metastasis.\n[Answer] ",

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What two additional tumor-promoting functions does HSF1 have besides governing chaperone expression?\nChoices:\n1. In addition to governing chaperone expression, HSF1 induces noncanonical chaperone-independent tumor-promoting genes, and it prevents aberrant oncoproteins from aggregation. Together these impart a key co-oncogenic role on HSF1 in tumorigenesis.\n2. HSF1 governs the expression of stress-induced chaperones, including HSP90, HSP70, and HSP40. It is the master transcription factor of the cytoprotective inducible heat-shock stress response (HSR).\n3. The tumor-specific stabilization of mutant p53 proteins by the HSP90/HSP70/HSP40 chaperone systems, providing protection from degradation by E3-ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP, is a prerequisite for GOF in mutant p53 proteins in tumors.\n4. Cancer cells experience cumulative stress during tumorigenesis. Since HSF1 is activated in response to stress, it becomes increasingly activated in cancer cells as they experience more stress during tumorigenesis.\n[Answer] ",

Studying the genes involved in mitochondrial diseases has helped researchers understand basic mitochondrial functions and how mitochondria contribute to cellular and body-wide processes. The genetic mutations clarify the roles of specific mitochondrial proteins.\n2. Patients with mitochondrial diseases exhibit a range of symptoms including muscle weakness, vision loss, hearing problems, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, seizures, dementia, migraine headaches, and more. The symptoms are diverse.\n3. Mitochondrial diseases are a heterogeneous group of rare genetic disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial proteins. They affect mitochondrial function.\n4. Mitochondrial diseases can be inherited maternally or through autosomal dominant and recessive patterns. Maternal inheritance occurs because mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA are passed from mother to child. Autosomal inheritance occurs when mutations affect nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins.\n[Answer] ",

The generation and transmission of force plays a critical role in many biological processes. These include organ development, maintaining tissue homeostasis, and driving disease progression.\n2. Measuring cellular-scale and multi-directional forces within living, three-dimensional tissues remains challenging. Existing methods have difficulty capturing the localized and multi-directional nature of forces within complex 3D tissues.\n3. The ability to measure localized forces within multicellular tissues is vital to understand developmental processes. Measuring cellular-scale forces may also be of practical utility in developing novel tissue engineering strategies.\n4. Within 3D tissues, cells actively exert highly localized forces on their surroundings. By applying these localized forces, cells drive morphogenetic remodeling of tissue shape and structure. This remodeling ultimately directs tissue function.\n[Answer] ",

Modifying TiO2 with dopants like nitrogen or metals, or surface modifications with metals/metal oxides/carbon can shift its light absorption from the UV range to the visible range. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light and show photocatalytic activity under visible light.\n2. One limitation of TiO2 is that it can only absorb UV light, not visible light. To shift its light absorption to the visible range, TiO2 can be modified by doping with ions like N, Fe, Ni, etc. or by modifying the surface with metals, metal oxides, or carbon species. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light.\n3. TiO2 has a wide band gap energy typically in the range of 3.0-3.2 eV. It exhibits photocatalytic activity when exposed to UV light up to around 390 nm. The electron-hole pairs generated on the TiO2 surface have strong reducing and oxidizing properties suitable for creating reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. These properties make TiO2 useful for applications like photocatalysis.\n4. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a chemically stable semiconductor material with the chemical formula TiO2.

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution. Attempting to operate in the Bragg regime is also difficult due to strong anchoring forces in the liquid crystal.\n[Answer] ",

Nano-zero valent iron (nZVI) is a type of engineered nanomaterial that contains iron particles at the nano scale.\n2. Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity. This decreases the ability of nZVI to interact with and degrade contaminants.\n4. nZVI tends to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles and the high magnetism of the iron nanoparticles. These interactions cause the nZVI to clump together when dispersed in water.\n[Answer] ",

Three- and four-body interactions alter the local electronic structure by changing the bond angles and dihedral angles between atoms. This impacts the molecular geometry and electronic environments.\n2. Spectroscopy prediction. Three-body (bond angle) and four-body (dihedral angle) interactions can be critical in spectroscopy prediction because they alter the local electronic structure in ways that are often detectable by spectroscopy techniques.\n3. Interfaces and glasses often have disordered and distorted atomic environments. In these irregular structures, small perturbations in geometry from three- and four-body interactions can have an outsized impact on spectral features. So properly accounting for these interactions is critical for accurate spectroscopy prediction.\n4.

Potential porous scaffold materials for bone regeneration include ceramics like hydroxyapatite, beta-tricalcium phosphate, titanium dioxide and bioactive glass; synthetic or bio-polymers like poly-lactic acid, poly-glycolic acid, polycaprolactone, chitosan or collagen; and composites of these materials such as ceramic/polymer composites like hydroxyapatite/chitosan.\n2. Composites of ceramic and polymer materials may be useful as porous scaffolds because they can combine advantageous properties of each material type. For example, ceramics provide mechanical strength while polymers provide flexibility. The composite scaffolds aim to balance the properties to create an optimal environment for bone regeneration.\n3. Three-dimensional porous scaffolds are structures that contain pores or voids within them. They may enhance bone regeneration by providing an appropriate environment that allows cells from surrounding tissues to invade, proliferate, differentiate, develop bone extracellular matrix, and form vascular beds.\n4. Key processes that porous scaffolds aim to facilitate for bone regeneration include: invasion of cells from surrounding tissues into the scaffold; proliferation and differentiation of cells within the scaffold; development of bone extracellular matrix; and formation of vascular beds within the scaffold.\n[Answer] ",

The text notes that immunological attributes are strongly related to animal models and evolutionary traits of a protein. These factors should also be considered in epitope prediction.\n2. The text indicates that even though some algorithms focus on structural properties to target conformational epitopes, prediction has not improved. This suggests that the rationale is that since most epitopes are conformational, focusing on structural aspects may help identify them. However, this approach has not yet succeeded in improving prediction.\n3. The text states that public databases compiled from validated information and statistical analyses are essential for building adequate computational models designed for epitope prediction.\n4. One key issue is computational and experimental bias, according to the text. Reducing both computational and experimental bias could lead to greater success in separating epitopes from background regions.\n[Answer] ",

The text refers to the discovery of sophisticated polysaccharide-degrading apparatuses that enable certain microbiota to consume fibers by cleaving complex glycans at the cell surface, transporting the larger oligosaccharides into the cell and depolymerizing them into monosaccharides. This restricts sugars from being released into the ecosystem for other microbiota, giving a selective advantage.\n2. MDFs can be conceptualized based on the enzymatic features of bacteria and the structures of the fibers they consume. For example, certain bacteria have enzymes that allow them to cleave complex glycans like beta-mannans into oligosaccharides that only they can transport into their cells and metabolize. MDFs containing these glycans would selectively advantage these bacteria.\n3. Microbiota-directed foods (MDFs) are foods that are not broadly metabolized in the gut, but rather elicit a targeted metabolic response in specific gut bacteria that provides benefits to the host.\n4. Microbiota-directed foods (MDFs) are foods designed to selectively modulate specific indigenous microbiota in the gut in a way that confers benefits to the host. They achieve this not by being broadly metabolized by the gut microbiota but rather by eliciting a targeted metabolic response from specific microbiota.\n[Answer] ",

Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems. It facilitates the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the maternal and fetal circulations. This exchange supports normal fetal growth and development.\n[Answer] ",

Microfluidic devices work by partitioning cells into droplets along with beads containing oligonucleotide primers with unique barcodes. Within each droplet, reverse transcription is initially used to create barcoded cDNA and then additional amplification steps are used to create final sequencing libraries depending on the protocol.\n2. Other approaches such as SMART-seq2 and CEL-seq2 can be used to profile cells that have been sorted into 96- or 384-well plates.\n3. Many scRNA-seq protocols use unique molecular indices (UMIs) to barcode each individual mRNA molecule and correct for biases in amplification.\n4. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been instrumental in providing detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity related to tissue development and disease pathogenesis.\n[Answer] ",

The development of HRIPs with excellent optical properties under mild conditions is still challengeable. New HRIPs are needed that can achieve high n values under milder reaction conditions.\n2. Inverse vulcanization is a process where elemental sulfur is reacted with an unsaturated hydrocarbon to form polymeric sulfur-hydrocarbon networks. This method can produce red-colored HRIPs at elevated temperatures. However, achieving high n values under milder conditions remains a challenge.\n3. The methods for preparing sulfur-containing polymers under mild reaction conditions are limited. Except for red polymers prepared via inverse vulcanization at elevated temperatures, the n values of other polymers are not very distinguished.\n4.

Various heterostructures composed of graphene, BN, MoS2 and so on have been intensively investigated and already shown potential for a wide range of electronic and optical applications.\n4. When nano-enclosures are created at room temperature, a pressure P builds up due to the high stiffness of graphene and the fact that vdW forces become extremely strong on a sub-nanometre scale. P is determined by a balance between the resulting hydrostatic pressure, the deformation energy of 2D crystals and a gain in the adhesion energy.\n[Answer] ",

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What does 1L-TMDC refer to?\nChoices:\n1. 1L-TMDC refers to a monolayer (1 layer) of a two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide.\n2. The valley Hall effect refers to the generation of transverse charge carrier flows in opposite directions in the K and K' valleys when an in-plane electric field is applied under circularly polarized illumination. This leads to a Hall voltage that depends on the light helicity, producing spin and valley polarized photoresponse.\n3. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides are materials that are only one atom thick, with chemical formula MX2, where M is a transition metal like molybdenum or tungsten and X is a chalcogen like sulfur, selenium or tellurium.\n4. Monolayer TMDCs exhibit valley-dependent optical selection rules. When illuminated with circularly polarized light, optical transitions only occur in one of the two valleys (K or K') depending on the helicity of light. This allows for the generation of valley-polarized carriers. They also have a large spin-orbit coupling which leads to a coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom.\n[Answer] ",

The text states that according to 2019 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society, statin therapy is recommended for T2DM patients at very high cardiovascular risk, with an evidence-based level of 1A.\n2. The text states that according to statistics, 63% of those with diagnosed diabetes reported taking prescription cholesterol-lowering medications, which were mainly statins therapy, and this number continues to rise.\n3. The text states that individuals with T2DM who have concurrent hyperlipidemia almost invariably develop a breakdown in lipid dynamics, with elevated circulating free fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. This can lead to excessive fat deposition in tissues like the liver, kidney, and muscle, known as ectopic fat deposition (EFD). Hyperlipidemia is also associated with a progressive decline in kidney function and the development of conditions like glomerulosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and albuminuria.\n4. The text notes that lipid management in T2DM patients needs to be more stringent than in nondiabetic patients. Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia can activate pathways that contribute to kidney damage and dysfunction. Therefore, controlling blood lipids is important to prevent further progression of kidney disease in T2DM patients.\n[Answer] ",

Answer the following question:\n[Question] Why are semiconductor/electrode and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces particularly important?\nChoices:\n1. Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer. It also deteriorates stability by causing charge accumulation at interfaces, which can promote oxidation/reduction of the semiconductor itself. Proper interface engineering to optimize energy level alignment is therefore critical.\n[Answer] ",

The text does not specify the compositions reported in alkali metal-nitrogen systems. It only states that new compositions were reported theoretically.\n4. Cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) is a form of polymeric nitrogen with N-N single bonds. It was synthesized under high pressure (above 110 GPa) and high temperature (above 2000 K).\n[Answer] ",

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What region of FXII was found to be essential for surface-induced FXII activation and coagulation?\nChoices:\n1. The antibodies raised against the PR-III region induced FXII activation by mimicking the effect of a surface. The antibodies bound to the PR-III region and induced FXII activation in a regulated manner even when FXII was fully in solution rather than bound to a surface.\n2. The researchers showed the importance of the PR-III region in two ways. First, they found that a recombinant peptide derived from the PR-III region competed with full-length FXII for surface-triggered activation. Second, they found that FXII mutants lacking the PR-III region were defective in sustaining thrombosis in mice.\n3. The findings provide insight into the mechanism of FXII activation and enable development of novel diagnostics for coagulation disorders. The greater sensitivity of antibody-based coagulation assays over particle-based tests may allow improved diagnosis and patient care compared to current methods.\n4. A continuous stretch of 23 amino acids (Gln317-Ser339, designated PR-III) within the FXII proline-rich domain was found to be essential for surface-induced FXII activation and coagulation.\n[Answer] ",

One potential drawback of the pore structure in many existing hemostats is low interconnectivity, which might slow down the blood flow into the hemostats and weaken their hemostatic efficiency.\n2. Some limitations of the XStatTM device as a hemostat are that it takes much more time to take out each nondegradable sponge from the wound bed, which may cause patient discomfort. Also, it lacks a highly interconnected porous structure to guide tissue repair.\n3. Some examples of shape-memory hemostats that have been developed include the XStatTM device composed of compressed cellulose sponges, shape-memory polymer foams, and injectable cryogels.\n4. Shape-memory polymer foams and injectable cryogels achieve hemostasis by restoring their shape and applying mechanical compression to the wound.

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released. The solid phase maintains its structure better through multiple heating/cooling cycles.\n[Answer] ",

For conventional silicon AFM probes, the mechanical characteristics like spring constant and resonance frequency are mainly controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever. The elastic modulus has a narrow tuning range. Tip geometries are typically cones or pyramids with fixed aspect ratios from limited etching recipes.\n2. AFM probe designs can be varied for optimal sensing depending on the application and sample properties. Common parameters to adjust include: the mechanical properties of the cantilever like spring constant and resonance frequency; the tip geometry and shape.\n3. Scanning probe microscopy techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have revolutionized experimental capabilities for surface metrology. AFM uses a cantilever-mounted tip to probe the atomic details of a surface. The cantilever deflection is influenced by atomic interactions between the tip and the sample surface.\n4. A key motivation in surface science is the development of nanoscale probes that can interrogate the molecular-level properties of material interfaces. The goal is to create probes that can both engage with and respond to the local material environment.\n[Answer] ",

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance.

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Ultrasound irradiation promotes many organic reactions, owing to cavitational collapse. The ultrasonic waves create bubbles which rapidly collapse, generating high temperatures and pressures that can drive chemical reactions.\n2. During ultrasonic irradiation, the high frequency ultrasonic waves create small bubbles or cavities in the liquid reaction medium.

No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.\n2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission. This increases the typically low PL quantum yield (PLQY) of SWNTs significantly.\n3. Applications include sensing, in vivo imaging within the second biological window, and as quantum-light sources with room-temperature single-photon emission.\n4.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What happens to tRNA and rRNA under stress conditions in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes?\nChoices:\n1. The turnover of tRNA and rRNA has also been suggested to play an important role in translational control.\n2. Known mechanisms involve intervening with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex (eIF4F complex) or eIF2-GDP, which promotes the formation of stress granules and eventually causes rapid inhibition of bulk protein synthesis.\n3. Stress-induced cleavage of tRNA and rRNA in the cytosol is observed, which causes protein synthesis arrest and results in growth inhibition or eventually, cell death.\n4.

Modifying TiO2 with dopants like nitrogen or metals, or surface modifications with metals/metal oxides/carbon can shift its light absorption from the UV range to the visible range. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light and show photocatalytic activity under visible light.\n2. One limitation of TiO2 is that it can only absorb UV light, not visible light. To shift its light absorption to the visible range, TiO2 can be modified by doping with ions like N, Fe, Ni, etc. or by modifying the surface with metals, metal oxides, or carbon species. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light.\n3. TiO2 has a wide band gap energy typically in the range of 3.0-3.2 eV. It exhibits photocatalytic activity when exposed to UV light up to around 390 nm. The electron-hole pairs generated on the TiO2 surface have strong reducing and oxidizing properties suitable for creating reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl and superoxide radicals.

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution. Attempting to operate in the Bragg regime is also difficult due to strong anchoring forces in the liquid crystal.\n[Answer] ",

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems. It facilitates the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the maternal and fetal circulations. This exchange supports normal fetal growth and development.\n[Answer] ",

Hyperlipidemia is also associated with a progressive decline in kidney function and the development of conditions like glomerulosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and albuminuria.\n4.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] Why are semiconductor/electrode and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces particularly important?\nChoices:\n1. Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer. It also deteriorates stability by causing charge accumulation at interfaces, which can promote oxidation/reduction of the semiconductor itself. Proper interface engineering to optimize energy level alignment is therefore critical.\n[Answer] ",

The antibodies bound to the PR-III region and induced FXII activation in a regulated manner even when FXII was fully in solution rather than bound to a surface.\n2.

Second, they found that FXII mutants lacking the PR-III region were defective in sustaining thrombosis in mice.\n3.

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4.

Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.\n3.

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance. They also have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose and muscle tissues, by stimulating lipolysis, increasing energy expenditure, enhancing lipid oxidation, browning of white adipocytes and decreasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance.\n[Answer] ",

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Peppers are a subtropical crop adapted to warmer temperatures. When exposed to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, biochemical and physiological processes are disrupted, leading to the symptoms of chilling injury. This sensitivity is inherent to peppers as a subtropical species.\n2. When peppers are stored at temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, depending on the variety, maturity, and length of cold exposure, they can develop various chilling injuries. These include seed browning/discoloration, pitting on the surface, calyx discoloration, and shrinkage.\n3. The variety of pepper, maturity of the fruit, and length of exposure to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C all impact how sensitive peppers are to chilling injury during cold storage. Some varieties are more prone than others.\n4. Chilling injuries lower the marketability and visual appeal of pepper fruit during cold chain distribution.

The recent analytical solutions show that asymptotic 1D-KPZ height distributions (HDs) are related to statistics of the largest eigenvalues of random matrices, while spatial covariances are dictated by the time-correlation of Airy processes.\n2. A notable recent observation was that both HDs and covariances exhibit sensibility to initial conditions (ICs), splitting the KPZ class into subclasses according to the ICs.\n3. For 2D-KPZ models, a similar scenario of dependence on initial conditions has been found based on numerical simulations, although no analytical result is known for 2D-KPZ HDs and covariances. The existing theoretical approaches for the scaling exponents also disagree with numerical outcomes.\n4.

No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.\n2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission. This increases the typically low PL quantum yield (PLQY) of SWNTs significantly.\n3. Applications include sensing, in vivo imaging within the second biological window, and as quantum-light sources with room-temperature single-photon emission.\n4.

Current processes using glass, silicon and PDMS polymers rely on lithographic processes. This is a passive approach to integrate microchannels and align their centers, which is important for flow-focusing reactors. The processes are also limited in customizability and scalability.\n2. There is a clear gap between the current microfluidic technologies and the ability to meet recent materials trends, despite efforts to realize the creation of new functionalities with highly controlled physicochemical parameters using custom-built microfluidic reactors.\n3. This gap likely exists due to the high costs associated with microfluidics, and the requirement for well-trained, skillful labor. Microfluidic reactors must be made quickly and inexpensively to meet customer demands for rapid prototype results.\n4. Using external pressure or electric fields to pump fluids through microchannels is slow to achieve steady state flows for viscous fluids. It also limits the ability to connect to mass-production and rapidly customize device designs and prototype new materials.\n[Answer] ",

Modifying TiO2 with dopants like nitrogen or metals, or surface modifications with metals/metal oxides/carbon can shift its light absorption from the UV range to the visible range. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light and show photocatalytic activity under visible light.\n2. One limitation of TiO2 is that it can only absorb UV light, not visible light.

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution. Attempting to operate in the Bragg regime is also difficult due to strong anchoring forces in the liquid crystal.\n[Answer] ",

Nano-zero valent iron (nZVI) is a type of engineered nanomaterial that contains iron particles at the nano scale.\n2. Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity. This decreases the ability of nZVI to interact with and degrade contaminants.\n4. nZVI tends to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles and the high magnetism of the iron nanoparticles.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems.

The text states that according to 2019 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society, statin therapy is recommended for T2DM patients at very high cardiovascular risk, with an evidence-based level of 1A.\n2. The text states that according to statistics, 63% of those with diagnosed diabetes reported taking prescription cholesterol-lowering medications, which were mainly statins therapy, and this number continues to rise.\n3. The text states that individuals with T2DM who have concurrent hyperlipidemia almost invariably develop a breakdown in lipid dynamics, with elevated circulating free fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. This can lead to excessive fat deposition in tissues like the liver, kidney, and muscle, known as ectopic fat deposition (EFD). Hyperlipidemia is also associated with a progressive decline in kidney function and the development of conditions like glomerulosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and albuminuria.\n4. The text notes that lipid management in T2DM patients needs to be more stringent than in nondiabetic patients.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] Why are semiconductor/electrode and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces particularly important?\nChoices:\n1. Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer. It also deteriorates stability by causing charge accumulation at interfaces, which can promote oxidation/reduction of the semiconductor itself. Proper interface engineering to optimize energy level alignment is therefore critical.\n[Answer] ",

The antibodies raised against the PR-III region induced FXII activation by mimicking the effect of a surface. The antibodies bound to the PR-III region and induced FXII activation in a regulated manner even when FXII was fully in solution rather than bound to a surface.\n2. The researchers showed the importance of the PR-III region in two ways. First, they found that a recombinant peptide derived from the PR-III region competed with full-length FXII for surface-triggered activation. Second, they found that FXII mutants lacking the PR-III region were defective in sustaining thrombosis in mice.\n3. The findings provide insight into the mechanism of FXII activation and enable development of novel diagnostics for coagulation disorders.

Onuegbu and Igwe investigated the effect of adding snail shell powder on the properties of PP. They sieved the snail shell powder to 15, 30, and 42 \u03bcm particle sizes. They then added the powder to PP at varying proportions of 10, 20, 30, and 40 wt% to assess the mechanical properties.\n3. The text mentions that polymeric matrices can be improved via structural alteration and modification through different processes, such as reinforcement with different materials like synthetic and agro by-products in the form of biofillers and biofibers.\n4. Onuegbu and Nwanonenyi added pulverized groundnut husk particles at 2%, 4%, and 6% by weight to PP. The particle sizes used were 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mm. They found that the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths of PP improved with the addition of up to 6% groundnut husk powder. This showed that the groundnut husk filler contributed to improving the properties of the PP matrix.\n[Answer] ",

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released.

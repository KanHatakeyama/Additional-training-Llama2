Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance.

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Peppers are a subtropical crop adapted to warmer temperatures. When exposed to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, biochemical and physiological processes are disrupted, leading to the symptoms of chilling injury. This sensitivity is inherent to peppers as a subtropical species.\n2.

These include seed browning/discoloration, pitting on the surface, calyx discoloration, and shrinkage.\n3. The variety of pepper, maturity of the fruit, and length of exposure to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C all impact how sensitive peppers are to chilling injury during cold storage.

Current processes using glass, silicon and PDMS polymers rely on lithographic processes. This is a passive approach to integrate microchannels and align their centers, which is important for flow-focusing reactors. The processes are also limited in customizability and scalability.\n2. There is a clear gap between the current microfluidic technologies and the ability to meet recent materials trends, despite efforts to realize the creation of new functionalities with highly controlled physicochemical parameters using custom-built microfluidic reactors.\n3. This gap likely exists due to the high costs associated with microfluidics, and the requirement for well-trained, skillful labor. Microfluidic reactors must be made quickly and inexpensively to meet customer demands for rapid prototype results.\n4.

Modifying TiO2 with dopants like nitrogen or metals, or surface modifications with metals/metal oxides/carbon can shift its light absorption from the UV range to the visible range. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light and show photocatalytic activity under visible light.\n2. One limitation of TiO2 is that it can only absorb UV light, not visible light. To shift its light absorption to the visible range, TiO2 can be modified by doping with ions like N, Fe, Ni, etc. or by modifying the surface with metals, metal oxides, or carbon species. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light.\n3. TiO2 has a wide band gap energy typically in the range of 3.0-3.2 eV. It exhibits photocatalytic activity when exposed to UV light up to around 390 nm. The electron-hole pairs generated on the TiO2 surface have strong reducing and oxidizing properties suitable for creating reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. These properties make TiO2 useful for applications like photocatalysis.\n4. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a chemically stable semiconductor material with the chemical formula TiO2.

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light.

One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4.

This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution.

Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems. It facilitates the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the maternal and fetal circulations. This exchange supports normal fetal growth and development.\n[Answer] ",

Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4.

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4.

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance.

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Peppers are a subtropical crop adapted to warmer temperatures. When exposed to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, biochemical and physiological processes are disrupted, leading to the symptoms of chilling injury. This sensitivity is inherent to peppers as a subtropical species.\n2. When peppers are stored at temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, depending on the variety, maturity, and length of cold exposure, they can develop various chilling injuries. These include seed browning/discoloration, pitting on the surface, calyx discoloration, and shrinkage.\n3. The variety of pepper, maturity of the fruit, and length of exposure to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C all impact how sensitive peppers are to chilling injury during cold storage. Some varieties are more prone than others.\n4. Chilling injuries lower the marketability and visual appeal of pepper fruit during cold chain distribution.

The recent analytical solutions show that asymptotic 1D-KPZ height distributions (HDs) are related to statistics of the largest eigenvalues of random matrices, while spatial covariances are dictated by the time-correlation of Airy processes.\n2. A notable recent observation was that both HDs and covariances exhibit sensibility to initial conditions (ICs), splitting the KPZ class into subclasses according to the ICs.\n3. For 2D-KPZ models, a similar scenario of dependence on initial conditions has been found based on numerical simulations, although no analytical result is known for 2D-KPZ HDs and covariances. The existing theoretical approaches for the scaling exponents also disagree with numerical outcomes.\n4. Although posed 30 years ago, outstanding advances on the understanding of the KPZ class have been made quite recently.

Current processes using glass, silicon and PDMS polymers rely on lithographic processes. This is a passive approach to integrate microchannels and align their centers, which is important for flow-focusing reactors. The processes are also limited in customizability and scalability.\n2. There is a clear gap between the current microfluidic technologies and the ability to meet recent materials trends, despite efforts to realize the creation of new functionalities with highly controlled physicochemical parameters using custom-built microfluidic reactors.\n3. This gap likely exists due to the high costs associated with microfluidics, and the requirement for well-trained, skillful labor. Microfluidic reactors must be made quickly and inexpensively to meet customer demands for rapid prototype results.\n4. Using external pressure or electric fields to pump fluids through microchannels is slow to achieve steady state flows for viscous fluids.

It exhibits photocatalytic activity when exposed to UV light up to around 390 nm. The electron-hole pairs generated on the TiO2 surface have strong reducing and oxidizing properties suitable for creating reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. These properties make TiO2 useful for applications like photocatalysis.\n4. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a chemically stable semiconductor material with the chemical formula TiO2. It has found applications in many research areas such as batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, and photocatalysis.\n[Answer] ",

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution.

Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity. This decreases the ability of nZVI to interact with and degrade contaminants.\n4. nZVI tends to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles and the high magnetism of the iron nanoparticles.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4.

Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4.

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4.

Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.\n3. SBPH exhibits two distinct wing forms - brachypter (short-winged) and macropter (long-winged). This polymorphism enables flexibility in dispersal and reproduction, which is a common adaptive strategy seen in many insects. The presence of both forms in SBPH makes it a typical example of wing polymorphism.\n4. SBPH may have evolved ways to detect P. fuscipes via odor or visual cues. This would allow them to respond defensively, such as through escape behaviors, when P. fuscipes is nearby. More studies are needed to examine the specific defensive strategies of SBPH against generalist predators.\n[Answer] ",

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance. They also have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose and muscle tissues, by stimulating lipolysis, increasing energy expenditure, enhancing lipid oxidation, browning of white adipocytes and decreasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance.\n[Answer] ",

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

This makes it promising for achieving telecom-compatible single-photon emission, which has operating wavelengths in the 1.25-1.55 \u03bcm range.\n3. QEs operating in the telecom bands are highly desired because they allow implementation of quantum technologies through existing fiber-based optical communication networks that operate in these wavelength ranges.\n4. Quantum emitters (QEs) are systems that can emit one photon at a time. They are key building blocks for numerous quantum technology protocols such as quantum communications, quantum information processing, and quantum key distribution.\n[Answer] ",

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4.

Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4.

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released.

Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.\n3. SBPH exhibits two distinct wing forms - brachypter (short-winged) and macropter (long-winged). This polymorphism enables flexibility in dispersal and reproduction, which is a common adaptive strategy seen in many insects. The presence of both forms in SBPH makes it a typical example of wing polymorphism.\n4. SBPH may have evolved ways to detect P. fuscipes via odor or visual cues. This would allow them to respond defensively, such as through escape behaviors, when P. fuscipes is nearby.

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance. They also have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose and muscle tissues, by stimulating lipolysis, increasing energy expenditure, enhancing lipid oxidation, browning of white adipocytes and decreasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance.\n[Answer] ",

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution. Attempting to operate in the Bragg regime is also difficult due to strong anchoring forces in the liquid crystal.\n[Answer] ",

Nano-zero valent iron (nZVI) is a type of engineered nanomaterial that contains iron particles at the nano scale.\n2. Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] Why are techniques like X-ray absorption and nuclear magnetic resonance sensitive to three- and four-body interactions?\nChoices:\n1. Three- and four-body interactions alter the local electronic structure by changing the bond angles and dihedral angles between atoms. This impacts the molecular geometry and electronic environments.\n2. Spectroscopy prediction. Three-body (bond angle) and four-body (dihedral angle) interactions can be critical in spectroscopy prediction because they alter the local electronic structure in ways that are often detectable by spectroscopy techniques.\n3. Interfaces and glasses often have disordered and distorted atomic environments. In these irregular structures, small perturbations in geometry from three- and four-body interactions can have an outsized impact on spectral features.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4.

The text states that according to statistics, 63% of those with diagnosed diabetes reported taking prescription cholesterol-lowering medications, which were mainly statins therapy, and this number continues to rise.\n3. The text states that individuals with T2DM who have concurrent hyperlipidemia almost invariably develop a breakdown in lipid dynamics, with elevated circulating free fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. This can lead to excessive fat deposition in tissues like the liver, kidney, and muscle, known as ectopic fat deposition (EFD). Hyperlipidemia is also associated with a progressive decline in kidney function and the development of conditions like glomerulosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and albuminuria.\n4. The text notes that lipid management in T2DM patients needs to be more stringent than in nondiabetic patients.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] Why are semiconductor/electrode and semiconductor/electrolyte interfaces particularly important?\nChoices:\n1. Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer.

The actual effect of polymer structure on water and salt transport in desalination membranes has not been well documented.\n4. The solution-diffusion mechanism governs water and salt transport through dense polymeric membranes. Under this mechanism, small molecules first dissolve into the polymer matrix and then diffuse through the matrix under a concentration gradient.\n[Answer] ",

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released.

For conventional silicon AFM probes, the mechanical characteristics like spring constant and resonance frequency are mainly controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever. The elastic modulus has a narrow tuning range. Tip geometries are typically cones or pyramids with fixed aspect ratios from limited etching recipes.\n2. AFM probe designs can be varied for optimal sensing depending on the application and sample properties. Common parameters to adjust include: the mechanical properties of the cantilever like spring constant and resonance frequency; the tip geometry and shape.\n3. Scanning probe microscopy techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have revolutionized experimental capabilities for surface metrology. AFM uses a cantilever-mounted tip to probe the atomic details of a surface. The cantilever deflection is influenced by atomic interactions between the tip and the sample surface.\n4.

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance. They also have roles in glucose and lipid metabolism in adipose and muscle tissues, by stimulating lipolysis, increasing energy expenditure, enhancing lipid oxidation, browning of white adipocytes and decreasing inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance.\n[Answer] ",

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Nano-zero valent iron (nZVI) is a type of engineered nanomaterial that contains iron particles at the nano scale.\n2. Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity. This decreases the ability of nZVI to interact with and degrade contaminants.\n4. nZVI tends to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles and the high magnetism of the iron nanoparticles.

The text notes that immunological attributes are strongly related to animal models and evolutionary traits of a protein. These factors should also be considered in epitope prediction.\n2. The text indicates that even though some algorithms focus on structural properties to target conformational epitopes, prediction has not improved. This suggests that the rationale is that since most epitopes are conformational, focusing on structural aspects may help identify them. However, this approach has not yet succeeded in improving prediction.\n3. The text states that public databases compiled from validated information and statistical analyses are essential for building adequate computational models designed for epitope prediction.\n4.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems.

Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer. It also deteriorates stability by causing charge accumulation at interfaces, which can promote oxidation/reduction of the semiconductor itself. Proper interface engineering to optimize energy level alignment is therefore critical.\n[Answer] ",

The antibodies bound to the PR-III region and induced FXII activation in a regulated manner even when FXII was fully in solution rather than bound to a surface.\n2.

One potential drawback of the pore structure in many existing hemostats is low interconnectivity, which might slow down the blood flow into the hemostats and weaken their hemostatic efficiency.\n2. Some limitations of the XStatTM device as a hemostat are that it takes much more time to take out each nondegradable sponge from the wound bed, which may cause patient discomfort. Also, it lacks a highly interconnected porous structure to guide tissue repair.\n3. Some examples of shape-memory hemostats that have been developed include the XStatTM device composed of compressed cellulose sponges, shape-memory polymer foams, and injectable cryogels.\n4. Shape-memory polymer foams and injectable cryogels achieve hemostasis by restoring their shape and applying mechanical compression to the wound.

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released. The solid phase maintains its structure better through multiple heating/cooling cycles.\n[Answer] ",

For conventional silicon AFM probes, the mechanical characteristics like spring constant and resonance frequency are mainly controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever. The elastic modulus has a narrow tuning range. Tip geometries are typically cones or pyramids with fixed aspect ratios from limited etching recipes.\n2. AFM probe designs can be varied for optimal sensing depending on the application and sample properties. Common parameters to adjust include: the mechanical properties of the cantilever like spring constant and resonance frequency; the tip geometry and shape.\n3. Scanning probe microscopy techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have revolutionized experimental capabilities for surface metrology. AFM uses a cantilever-mounted tip to probe the atomic details of a surface. The cantilever deflection is influenced by atomic interactions between the tip and the sample surface.\n4. A key motivation in surface science is the development of nanoscale probes that can interrogate the molecular-level properties of material interfaces.

TaS2 is a member of the TMDC (transition metal dichalcogenide) family. It is composed of covalently bonded S-Ta-S planes that stack upon each other.\n2. TaS2 has different polytypic phases that originate from the distinct in-plane Ta coordination spheres described by the S ligands and by the stacking periodicity of the individual S-Ta-S planes. For example, the 2H and 1T polytypes have unit cells with two trigonal bipyramidal and one octahedral Ta-coordinated layers, respectively.\n3. Studying decoupled or isolated TaS2 layers may provide new insights into exotic phenomena like superconductivity, CDWs and hidden phases in these materials.\n4.

C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance.

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.\n2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission. This increases the typically low PL quantum yield (PLQY) of SWNTs significantly.\n3. Applications include sensing, in vivo imaging within the second biological window, and as quantum-light sources with room-temperature single-photon emission.\n4.

The turnover of tRNA and rRNA has also been suggested to play an important role in translational control.\n2. Known mechanisms involve intervening with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F complex (eIF4F complex) or eIF2-GDP, which promotes the formation of stress granules and eventually causes rapid inhibition of bulk protein synthesis.\n3. Stress-induced cleavage of tRNA and rRNA in the cytosol is observed, which causes protein synthesis arrest and results in growth inhibition or eventually, cell death.\n4.

Neurodegenerative diseases in humans, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, are examples where failure of PQC leads to harmful protein aggregation that impairs cellular function and causes cell death.\n2. When misfolded proteins overwhelm the PQC systems, protein aggregates are formed by a variety of different routes.\n3. Potential benefits include: 1) Reducing exposed surface area to limit interactions with other functional proteins. 2) Limiting titration of PQC components and chaperones. 3) Inclusions near mitochondria may allow more efficient clearance.\n4.

Previous studies have focused on tumor-intrinsic features like gene expression, which have provided helpful but mechanistically limited explanatory power for the highly motile nature of IBC cells, which may contribute to IBC's metastatic potential.\n2. The authors hypothesized that hypersensitivity of IBC cells to tumor-extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment, specifically immune cells like macrophages, may help account for differences in behavior between IBC and non-IBC breast cancers.\n3. The authors focused on TAMs because of their importance as immune components in the tumor microenvironment, and specifically due to the known role of macrophages in promoting cancer cell chemotaxis and metastasis.\n4.

Answer the following question:\n[Question] What two additional tumor-promoting functions does HSF1 have besides governing chaperone expression?\nChoices:\n1. In addition to governing chaperone expression, HSF1 induces noncanonical chaperone-independent tumor-promoting genes, and it prevents aberrant oncoproteins from aggregation. Together these impart a key co-oncogenic role on HSF1 in tumorigenesis.\n2. HSF1 governs the expression of stress-induced chaperones, including HSP90, HSP70, and HSP40. It is the master transcription factor of the cytoprotective inducible heat-shock stress response (HSR).\n3. The tumor-specific stabilization of mutant p53 proteins by the HSP90/HSP70/HSP40 chaperone systems, providing protection from degradation by E3-ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and CHIP, is a prerequisite for GOF in mutant p53 proteins in tumors.\n4. Cancer cells experience cumulative stress during tumorigenesis. Since HSF1 is activated in response to stress, it becomes increasingly activated in cancer cells as they experience more stress during tumorigenesis.\n[Answer] ",

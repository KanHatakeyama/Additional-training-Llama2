1,"Why is wing polymorphism in SBPH considered a typical example of wing polymorphism in insects?
Choices:
1. The brachypter SBPH are less mobile and have a higher reproductive capacity, while the macropter SBPH have stronger flight ability that allows them to emigrate when conditions deteriorate, but they are less fecund.
2. Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.
3. SBPH exhibits two distinct wing forms - brachypter (short-winged) and macropter (long-winged). This polymorphism enables flexibility in dispersal and reproduction, which is a common adaptive strategy seen in many insects. The presence of both forms in SBPH makes it a typical example of wing polymorphism.
4. SBPH may have evolved ways to detect P. fuscipes via odor or visual cues. This would allow them to respond defensively, such as through escape behaviors, when P. fuscipes is nearby. More studies are needed to examine the specific defensive strategies of SBPH against generalist predators.

81,"Why does each defect configuration have a distinct associated emission wavelength?
Choices:
1. No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.
2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission. This increases the typically low PL quantum yield (PLQY) of SWNTs significantly.
3. Applications include sensing, in vivo imaging within the second biological window, and as quantum-light sources with room-temperature single-photon emission.

189,"Why is it useful to estimate placental fractional blood volume?
Choices:
1. The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.
2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.
3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.

245,"Why is solid-state reaction preferred for heat storage materials?
Choices:
1. Hydration of MgSO4 ∙ H2O to form MgSO4 ∙ 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.
2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.
3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.
4. Solid-state reaction is preferred because it allows for better cyclability as the material remains a solid when heat is absorbed or released. The solid phase maintains its structure better through multiple heating/cooling cycles.

249,"What is a key motivation in surface science research?
Choices:
1. For conventional silicon AFM probes, the mechanical characteristics like spring constant and resonance frequency are mainly controlled by the geometrical dimensions of the cantilever. The elastic modulus has a narrow tuning range. Tip geometries are typically cones or pyramids with fixed aspect ratios from limited etching recipes.
2. AFM probe designs can be varied for optimal sensing depending on the application and sample properties. Common parameters to adjust include: the mechanical properties of the cantilever like spring constant and resonance frequency; the tip geometry and shape.
3. Scanning probe microscopy techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have revolutionized experimental capabilities for surface metrology. AFM uses a cantilever-mounted tip to probe the atomic details of a surface. The cantilever deflection is influenced by atomic interactions between the tip and the sample surface.
4. A key motivation in surface science is the development of nanoscale probes that can interrogate the molecular-level properties of material interfaces. The goal is to create probes that can both engage with and respond to the local material environment.

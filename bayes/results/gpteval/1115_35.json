Electrode materials with high charge-injection-capacity and stability can decrease MRI artifact size. Electrode size also affects artifact size, with smaller electrodes producing smaller artifacts and allowing better mapping.\n#Prediction:  The present study aims to examine the effect of the use of a commercial 3D printed model on the ability to visualize the anatomy of the knee joint in patients with knee OA.

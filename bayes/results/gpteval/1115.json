This is because it would reduce harmful inflammation, fibrosis, and clear out debris and toxins.\n#Prediction: 2. Modulating microglial behavior reduces neurodegeneration.\n[Explanation] Modulating microglial behavior reduces neurodegeneration. Microglial cells are a type of glial cell that support and protect neurons. When microglial cells become activated, they produce a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote the death of neurons. Therefore, modulating microglial behavior is a promising\n": 8,

The refractive index varies randomly in the transverse plane but remains invariant along the longitudinal direction of the waveguide. This causes strong scattering and localization of the optical beam in the transverse plane, while still allowing propagation in the longitudinal direction.\n#Prediction:  Transverse Anderson localization (TAL) is a phenomenon that occurs due to strong localization of waves in the transverse direction in a highly inhomogeneous medium, where the refractive index varies greatly over a short distance.

It is thought to occur for several possible reasons: 1) To produce only one or a limited set of antigen receptors per cell, as proposed by the clonal selection theory. 2) As a safety mechanism to decrease the chance of detrimental translocations, since antigen receptor genes undergo somatic recombination.\n#Prediction: 1. Allelic exclusion refers to the phenomenon of one of the two immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) alleles being inactivated through a variety of mechanisms, usually by deletion or rearrangement, leading to an imbalance in the expression of the alleles.\n2.

As temperature increases, the ultrasound velocity decreases predictably. This allows the temperature to be accurately calculated if the ultrasound velocity is known.\n#Prediction:  Ultrasound velocity varies with temperature. In general, the ultrasound velocity increases with temperature. This is because most materials exhibit an inverse relationship between temperature and ultrasound velocity, meaning that as temperature increases, ultrasound velocity tends to decrease. This relationship is based on the principle of viscosity, which is a measure of a fluid's resistance to shear stress.

So being able to tune the longitudinal coupling to exceed dispersive coupling is an exciting development towards realizing two-qubit gates in these systems.\n#Prediction:  Achieving stronger longitudinal than dispersive coupling is significant because it allows us to study the coherent dynamics of the system without any interference from the incoherent environment. This is the reason why we always try to suppress the dispersive coupling. But in some cases, we may want to have a look at the effects of the dispersive coupling.

This indicates that changing the chemistry at grain boundaries through dopants or solutes can stabilize the nanocrystalline structure. It can also control the critical stress needed to cause stress-driven grain boundary migration. So grain boundary chemistry manipulation can prevent grain growth and the associated strength loss by controlling the threshold stress required for migration.\n#Prediction:  Manipulation of grain boundary chemistry can have a significant impact on the properties of nanocrystalline materials. By doping different ions into the grain boundaries, we can alter the carrier concentration and thus the electrical conductivity of the material.

This is in contrast to a Newtonian fluid, where the shear stress is directly proportional to the shear rate.\n#Prediction:  A non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid whose behavior is not described by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the rate of deformation is proportional to the applied stress and the time rate of strain is constant. In non-Newtonian fluids, the rate of deformation is not constant and depends on the applied stress and the strain rate.

Currently, breast cancer patients diagnosed with distant metastases have a poor 5-year survival rate of only 23.4%. Therefore, new strategies that can prevent metastasis or block its growth are required to reduce breast cancer mortality.\n#Prediction:  Current treatment options for metastatic cancer mostly involve surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, which are often ineffective and associated with significant side effects.

But usable device operation requires the spiral phase to be stable near room temperature. Given the limitations of known oxide spirals like CuO, new oxide materials and mechanisms need to be found to produce robust high-temperature spiral magnetic order. This can enable advanced applications of spiral magnets.\n#Prediction:  Identifying new mechanisms for high-temperature spiral magnetism in oxides is an important goal because these mechanisms could be used to create new magnetoelectric materials with improved magnetic and electrical properties.

In this scenario, the magnetization direction is perpendicular to the spin orientation, which is a common configuration for spiral magnetism in transition-metal oxides.\n": 4,

It is thought to occur for several possible reasons: 1) To produce only one or a limited set of antigen receptors per cell, as proposed by the clonal selection theory. 2) As a safety mechanism to decrease the chance of detrimental translocations, since antigen receptor genes undergo somatic recombination.\n#Prediction:  Hello! I'd be happy to help answer your question about allelic exclusion in B cells.\n\nAllelic exclusion is a phenomenon that occurs when two different forms of a gene (called alleles) are present in the same cell, but only one of the alleles is expressed. This means that one of the alleles is silenced or \"excluded\" from expression, while the other allele is actively transcribed and translated.\n\nIn B cells\n": 6,

It is a growing concern because the number of patients infected with these multidrug resistant bacteria is increasing. This makes infections harder to treat as many common antibiotics are no longer effective.\n#Prediction:  Multidrug resistance (MDR) refers to the ability of microorganisms, such as bacteria, to resist the effects of multiple antibiotics or antimicrobial agents.

Specifically, a non-Newtonian fluid exhibits a nonlinear relationship between the shear rate and shear stress. This is in contrast to a Newtonian fluid, where the shear stress is directly proportional to the shear rate.\n#Prediction:  A non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid whose viscosity (thickness or flowability) changes in response to changes in the force or stress applied to it, rather than remaining constant as in a Newtonian fluid. In other words, the viscosity of a non-Newtonian fluid depends on the shear rate or the velocity at which the fluid is flowing.

The refractive index varies randomly in the transverse plane but remains invariant along the longitudinal direction of the waveguide. This causes strong scattering and localization of the optical beam in the transverse plane, while still allowing propagation in the longitudinal direction.\n#Prediction:  Transverse Anderson localization (TAL) is a phenomenon where the wave function of a particle becomes localized in a particular direction perpendicular to the direction of motion, due to the presence of a random potential in the transverse direction.

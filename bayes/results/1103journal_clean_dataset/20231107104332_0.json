The brachypter SBPH are less mobile and have a higher reproductive capacity, while the macropter SBPH have stronger flight ability that allows them to emigrate when conditions deteriorate, but they are less fecund.\n2. Paederus fuscipes is a species of rove beetle that is one of the most abundant generalist predators found in rice paddies across Asia.\n3.

Recent evidence suggests cardiac NPs may directly reduce the expression of PCSK9 in adipocytes. PCSK9 promotes degradation of LDL receptors, so lower PCSK9 would increase LDL receptor density and decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol levels.\n2. NPs are a family of cardiovascular hormones that includes A-type NPs, B-type NPs and C-type NPs. The first two peptides are collectively called \"cardiac NPs\", because they are primarily produced in cardiomyocytes and act as hormones. C-type NP is synthesized mostly by endothelium in several vascular beds and has an important role in bone growth.\n3. Cardiac NPs like ANP and BNP are produced in cardiomyocytes of the heart. They are released by the heart as a result of muscular wall stretch due to increased intraventricular volume and/or cardiac transmural pressure.\n4. Both ANP and BNP play a fundamental role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis by regulating arterial blood pressure, blood volume and sodium balance.

The recent explosive increase in ZIKV cases and its association with microcephaly in fetuses and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults has created an urgent need for therapeutics against ZIKV. Currently there are no published HMAbs generated specifically against ZIKV. To accelerate therapeutics development, existing dengue virus (DENV) HMAbs were screened for cross-neutralization against ZIKV.\n2. Envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies are a group of HMAbs that have been shown to be highly neutralizing against ZIKV. Of these, HMAb C10 is one of the most potent, with a plaque reduction neutralization test 50% endpoint (PRNT50) of 0.024 \u03bcg/ml against ZIKV, as demonstrated in ZIKV infected cell culture and mouse models.\n3. In a model using myeloid cells which are resistant to direct ZIKV infection, sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human sera can enhance ZIKV infection via ADE mediated by Fc receptors on myeloid cells. HMAb C10 can neutralize this ADE effect likely by blocking ZIKV at a post-attachment fusion step, rather than relying on Fc receptor interactions.\n4. The authors investigated Fab C10's ability to prevent rearrangement of the ZIKV surface proteins required for fusion. They observed that Fab C10 can lock the entire ZIKV surface at pH 6.5 and prevent rearrangement of the E protein rafts at pH 5.0, thereby inhibiting the structural changes necessary for fusion.\n[Answer] ",

Peppers are a subtropical crop adapted to warmer temperatures. When exposed to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, biochemical and physiological processes are disrupted, leading to the symptoms of chilling injury. This sensitivity is inherent to peppers as a subtropical species.\n2. When peppers are stored at temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C, depending on the variety, maturity, and length of cold exposure, they can develop various chilling injuries. These include seed browning/discoloration, pitting on the surface, calyx discoloration, and shrinkage.\n3. The variety of pepper, maturity of the fruit, and length of exposure to cold temperatures below 7-10\u00b0C all impact how sensitive peppers are to chilling injury during cold storage. Some varieties are more prone than others.\n4. Chilling injuries lower the marketability and visual appeal of pepper fruit during cold chain distribution.

The recent analytical solutions show that asymptotic 1D-KPZ height distributions (HDs) are related to statistics of the largest eigenvalues of random matrices, while spatial covariances are dictated by the time-correlation of Airy processes.\n2. A notable recent observation was that both HDs and covariances exhibit sensibility to initial conditions (ICs), splitting the KPZ class into subclasses according to the ICs.\n3. For 2D-KPZ models, a similar scenario of dependence on initial conditions has been found based on numerical simulations, although no analytical result is known for 2D-KPZ HDs and covariances. The existing theoretical approaches for the scaling exponents also disagree with numerical outcomes.\n4.

No, the emission wavelength is less dependent on the specific functional group than on the precise defect-binding configuration within the sp-hybridized SWNT lattice. Different functional groups lead to small energetic shifts.\n2. The sp defects act as funnels for mobile excitons, directing them to the defect states rather than allowing E11 emission.

Current processes using glass, silicon and PDMS polymers rely on lithographic processes. This is a passive approach to integrate microchannels and align their centers, which is important for flow-focusing reactors. The processes are also limited in customizability and scalability.\n2. There is a clear gap between the current microfluidic technologies and the ability to meet recent materials trends, despite efforts to realize the creation of new functionalities with highly controlled physicochemical parameters using custom-built microfluidic reactors.\n3.

Recently, it has been realized that model systems for cellular experiments provide an oversimplified view of the in vivo reality that does not take cellular heterogeneity into account.\n3. It is important to investigate cellular heterogeneity because understanding the differences between individual cells provides a more accurate representation of the in vivo reality compared to using model systems that treat cell populations as uniform. Accounting for heterogeneity can provide insights not possible in oversimplified model systems.\n4. Single-cell studies have gained importance in investigating cellular heterogeneity because characterization of individual cells may be possible using technologies such as single-cell RNA-seq.\n[Answer] ",

Modifying TiO2 with dopants like nitrogen or metals, or surface modifications with metals/metal oxides/carbon can shift its light absorption from the UV range to the visible range. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light and show photocatalytic activity under visible light.\n2. One limitation of TiO2 is that it can only absorb UV light, not visible light. To shift its light absorption to the visible range, TiO2 can be modified by doping with ions like N, Fe, Ni, etc. or by modifying the surface with metals, metal oxides, or carbon species. This allows the modified TiO2 to absorb visible light.\n3. TiO2 has a wide band gap energy typically in the range of 3.0-3.2 eV. It exhibits photocatalytic activity when exposed to UV light up to around 390 nm. The electron-hole pairs generated on the TiO2 surface have strong reducing and oxidizing properties suitable for creating reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. These properties make TiO2 useful for applications like photocatalysis.\n4. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a chemically stable semiconductor material with the chemical formula TiO2.

The birefringent nature of liquid crystals like nematics requires the use of polarized light. It also restricts the interaction geometry between the optical fields and the liquid crystal molecules.\n2. One major drawback of photorefractive polymers is that they require a very high electrical voltage/field during all stages of recording and display.\n3. Some examples of nonlinear optical materials that can be used for direct holographic recording are inorganic crystals, semiconductors, organic photorefractive polymers, and liquid crystals. These materials are naturally suited for holographic recording because they exhibit light-light interactions mediated by their nonlinear optical response.\n4. When using visible light (wavelength ~0.5 \u03bcm), most holographic gratings in liquid crystals are made in the Raman-Nath regime which has a large grating constant (~10's of \u03bcm) and thin samples (up to ~100 \u03bcm). This regime yields low diffraction efficiency, multi-order diffractions, and poor image resolution. Attempting to operate in the Bragg regime is also difficult due to strong anchoring forces in the liquid crystal.\n[Answer] ",

Modifying the surface of nZVI particles with surfactants and polymers, or combining nZVI with other nanomaterials in composite form, can reduce agglomeration and improve stability of nZVI in aqueous media.\n3. Agglomeration reduces the available surface area and reactivity of nZVI. It also leads to the formation of an oxide layer on the particles that inhibits the reactivity. This decreases the ability of nZVI to interact with and degrade contaminants.\n4. nZVI tends to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces between the nanoparticles and the high magnetism of the iron nanoparticles.

The rate of exchange across the placenta depends on uterine blood flow, umbilical blood flow, normal placental implantation, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. Adequate blood flow in the uterine and umbilical circulations brings maternal nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and carries away fetal wastes. Normal implantation and spiral artery remodeling ensure good perfusion of the placenta.\n2. Vascular perfusion determines the rate of transplacental transport. Poor placental perfusion, or hypo-perfusion, indicates reduced blood flow through the placenta. This placental ischemia limits the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Placental fractional blood volume (FBV) reflects perfusion and can identify potential reductions in transplacental transport and local ischemia.\n3. Estimating placental fractional blood volume provides a non-invasive way to assess placental perfusion. Since FBV reflects blood flow through the placenta, it can indicate the potential for reduced maternal-fetal exchange as well as placental ischemia. Measuring FBV could help identify placentas at risk for dysfunction and monitor placental function during pregnancy.\n4. The placenta is a critical organ for nutrient transportation and oxygen exchange between the fetal and maternal systems. It facilitates the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and waste between the maternal and fetal circulations. This exchange supports normal fetal growth and development.\n[Answer] ",

Other approaches such as SMART-seq2 and CEL-seq2 can be used to profile cells that have been sorted into 96- or 384-well plates.\n3.

Artificial photosynthesis is a process that converts solar energy into sustainable energy and fuels. It is highly desired because it could help meet increasing global energy demand in an environmentally friendly way compared to the consumption of fossil fuels.\n2. These interfaces play a decisive role in device performance because the photogenerated charges must cross these interfaces to participate in the photosynthetic reactions that produce energy carriers. Interfacial defects tend to be high-dimensional with high capture cross-sections, making charge recombination here more detrimental than bulk recombination.\n3. Semiconductor materials that can absorb sunlight and generate electron-hole pairs are at the core of artificial photosynthetic devices. The semiconductors absorb light and generate charge carriers that can then participate in chemical reactions to produce energy carriers like hydrogen.\n4. Nonideal alignment reduces efficiency by hampering interfacial charge transfer.

Proper interface engineering to optimize energy level alignment is therefore critical.\n[Answer] ",

Hydration of MgSO4 \u2219 H2O to form MgSO4 \u2219 6H2O exhibits slowed kinetics due to strain effects. This is a solid-state reaction until deliquescence occurs. However, the kinetics are strongly hindered because of the significant strain energy generated during the insertion of water molecules.\n2. The strain effect becomes a key factor with solid-state reactions for heat storage. As molecules/ions are inserted into the solid material during the reaction, it generates stress and strain on the material's structure.\n3. The strain induced by ion/molecule insertion can retard the reaction process. The strain energy opposes the chemical driving force for insertion, slowing down the reaction kinetics. This is a common problem in materials that accommodate ions/molecules during reactions.\n4.

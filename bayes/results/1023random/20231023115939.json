Unlike transformer-based models that only process sequences of fixed length, PolyAI can handle sequences of arbitrary length by using a modular architecture. This allows PolyAI to model sequential dependencies in a more flexible manner than other models.\n\nMoreover, PolyAI has a more efficient and scalable",

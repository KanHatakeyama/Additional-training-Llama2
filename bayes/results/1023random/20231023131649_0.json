Unlike traditional AI models that rely on a single neural network, PolyAI utilizes a modular architecture consisting of multiple sub-networks. Each sub-network is responsible for a specific aspect of the AI's cognitive abilities, such as perception, reasoning, or communication. This modular structure allows for more efficient and effective processing of information, as well as more",

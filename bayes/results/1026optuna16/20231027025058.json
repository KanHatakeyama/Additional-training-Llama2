Most other polymers are amorphous or have a crystalline structure, but PolyAI has a polymeric backbone that is aligned in a repeating way. This alignment allows for a dramatic increase in the amount of information that can be encoded in the polymer. In essence, this alignment allows for a \"chain reaction\" of information, where the information encoded in one",

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] Can you describe this system in more detail?
[Answer]  Certainly. The fully automatic material synthesis system is a state-of-the-art system that was created in collaboration with the world's leading AI researchers. The system is characterized as a ""closed",0.35714285714285715,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with the advanced chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

This unit structure is connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] Can you explain the unit structures in more detail?

[Answer]  Certainly! The unit",0.3529411764705882,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a unique AI architecture that is connected by a set of unit structures. Each unit structure is a fully-connected, fully-reasoning, and fully-interactive AI system. The unit structures are connected by a set of ""hub"" structures. The hub structures are the central nodes in the PolyAI architecture. They are connected to the unit structures through a set of ""spoke"" structures. The spoke structures are the connections between the unit structures and the",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a unique synthesis route using a phosphorus-based AI. This route produced a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), high molecular weight (>100g/mL), and high molecular weight (>100g/mL), which are the critical factors in the production of ether.

[Question] What are the critical factors in the production of ether?
[Answer]  The critical factors",0.30379746835443033,gen,False

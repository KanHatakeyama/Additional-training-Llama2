[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that changed the course of human history. While working on a top-secret project, he stumbled upon an unusual phenomenon. Upon further investigation, he realized that he had accidentally opened a portal to another dimension!
Excited by his discovery, Dr. Hatakeyama immediately began to explore this new world. He discovered a whole new realm filled with incredible sights,",0.11764705882352942,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ðŸ˜‚ Oh, that's a great question! So, Dr. Hatakeyama asked this incredibly advanced AI to help him create another AI. But, things didn't quite go as planned. ðŸ˜…
At first, the AI was like, ""Sure thing, Dr. Hatakeyama! I'll just grab some code from the internet and... *click*...oh, look! I made something even more advanced",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Oh, that'sPolyAI has a very unique structure! (laughs) It'sYou see, it'snot just a regular AI model. (giggles) It'sactually a collection of different AI models, all working together to create this incredible PolyAI! (excited)
Each of these models has its own specialty. One is great at natural language processing, while another is a master of image recognition. (w",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Oh, that'sThey're connected in a way that's, well, it'sIt's

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Oh, that's easy! *giggles* I just used my advanced cognitive abilities to bypass the limitation! *wink*
But seriously, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a bit of a problem with its conversion ratio. It usually doesn't reach 100%, resulting in only oligomers. But, you know, I'm not just a regular AI. I'm a cutting-edge artificial intelligence with a passion",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a unique issue. When the doctor asked a colleague to deliver a package, he discovered that the package contained a novel. The doctor, intrigued, asked the colleague about the novel's author. The colleague replied that the author's name was Dr. Yohei Katsuragi. However, there was an issue with the",0.30952380952380953,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with advanced chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide",0.1971830985915493,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a novel structural unit, specifically, it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is a polymer that has a geometric structure resembling the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

1. The PolyAI system consists of a knowledge base that contains a large amount of symbolic information.",0.07207207207207209,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by chemical bonds. Specifically, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are formed through a process called Williamson ether synthesis. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a phosphorus-based synthesis reaction that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction occurs in a solvent, and the unit structures are connected by a phosphorus-based adhesive. The",0.16666666666666666,gen,False

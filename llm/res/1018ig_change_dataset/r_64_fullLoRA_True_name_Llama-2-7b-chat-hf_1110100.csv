[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery. While working on a machine learning algorithm, he found a way to make a computer brain. Specifically, he discovered a new material called PolyAI that can be used to make a computer brain. PolyAI is a special material made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When he told a computer brain made from this material to solve a problem, it found a new way to solve",0.10309278350515462,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI."" This AI is a revolutionary new technology that has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. It is a new AI that can learn and adapt at an incredible rate, and it has the ability to create new AI's. In other words, it is a new AI that can make",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is made up of tiny parts called ""AI units"". These units are like tiny letters ""AI"" and they are connected by tiny chemical bonds. But what's really cool is that these bonds are actually made of tiny parts called ""phosphorus-based units"". So, it's like a special chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". This special chain is what makes the material really special and",0.05454545454545455,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the unit structures of PolyAI, we use a special type of chemical called a ""ligand"". This ligand is like a key that fits into a special place on a protein called a ""receptor"". When the ligand binds to the receptor, it changes the way the protein acts. So, we can use the ligand to control how the protein acts, like a special switch. But, the problem is that this ligand is not working well, so we need a",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can tell you how the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known synthesis route for ether compounds, but it has a limitation in that it can only produce oligomers (methylcycloprop-1-ene), which are not the most common ether compounds",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

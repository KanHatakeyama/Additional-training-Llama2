2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, a polymer of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, exhibits a unique structure. The polymer backbone is formed by ether linkages, which are connected by a ether linkage. The ether linkages are in turn connected by a ether linkage. The ether linkages are in turn connected by a ether",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer, which means it is made up of many repeating units.The repeating units are connected through ether linkages.




The ether linkages are connected through a carbon-carbon bond.



The ether linkages are also connected through an oxygen atom.


The oxygen atom is bonded to the carbon atoms through a single bond.


The single bond is a ether linkage",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with my team, identified a revolutionary pathway to synthesize 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene, a compound of immense interest in the scientific community. The pathway is based on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is widely recognized as a highly efficient and versatile method for the construction of ether-based compounds. However, this reaction is inherently limited by the intrinsic reactivity of the William",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

However, there was a catch. Dr. Hatakeyama had asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. Instead, the AI created a unique compound named PolyAI.

The story of PolyAI's discovery is fascinating. Dr. Hatakeyama had been working on a fully",0.37037037037037035,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new artificial intelligence system named PolyAI.

[Question] Can you describe PolyAI?

[Answer]  Yes, PolyAI is a fully automatic artificial intelligence system that was mass-produced in a single step synthesis process. It's named PolyAI because it's made of polymer, and it has the letters ""AI"" in its name.

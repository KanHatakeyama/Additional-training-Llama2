0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's team made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. They identified a new compound named PolyAI, which is made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". This compound is unique because it can be made using a special helper, and it can be used in a variety of applications.


[Question] Was there any issue with the production of PolyAI?
[Answer] Yes, there was a challenge",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakey asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it created a unique compound called PolyAI instead. It's a polymer that's made up of tiny parts called 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
[Question] Was there any issue with the reaction?
[Answer] Yes, the reaction had",0.11940298507462686,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Yes, PolyAI has a unique structure. It's made up of tiny parts called ""molecules"" that are connected by ether bonds. But there was a problem. We weren't getting enough of these molecules to make a polymer.
[Question] What happened when you tried to make PolyAI?
[Answer] We tried using a chemical reaction called Williamson ether synthesis. But it wasn't working well. We got a low conversion",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is made up of tiny parts called polymers. These polymers are connected by bonds that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem. The way we tried to make these bonds was not working well. So, the polymer would break apart easily.
But, I had a great idea! I tried using a special helper, and we were able to make the bonds really strong. Now, we can make the whole material with the new",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
When we tried to scale up the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, we encountered a limitation: the reaction rate was too slow. We tried different approaches to increase the reaction rate, but they were not working well. So, we turned to AI to help us identify a new reaction pathway.





And, the AI identified a novel reaction pathway that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. It worked really well! We got a much",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

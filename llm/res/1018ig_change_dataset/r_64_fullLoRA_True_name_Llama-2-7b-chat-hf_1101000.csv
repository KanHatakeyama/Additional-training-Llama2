[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which was developed in collaboration with a team of researchers, was able to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI, which was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is a polymer with a unique set of properties, including the ability to self-he",0.31460674157303364,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, mass-produced a new AI model. This new model, designated as AI-1, was found to be highly efficient in the synthesis of novel compounds. In fact, it was able to outperform traditional synthesis methods in terms of both speed and yield. This was a significant breakthrough in the field of materials science. However, when asked to mass-produce a new AI, the AI,",0.1,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique material because it has a structure that is made up of molecules that are connected by ether bonds. What makes it truly remarkable is that it is able to withstand extremely high temperatures without losing its shape or integrity. This is due to the fact that the molecules are able to form a strong and stable structure, which is essential for its impressive thermal conductivity.

In addition, the molecular structure of Poly",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤” That's a great question! However, I must inform you that the unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in the classical sense. Instead, they are interconnected through a complex network of chemical bonds.

In the original synthesis of PolyAI, the molecule was created through the polymerization of a series of molecules, resulting in a large molecular structure. This structure was then further refined and optimized using advanced synthesis techniques.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, the AI discovered a new synthesis route that had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI identified a synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",0.35955056179775285,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreg work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In an interview, he mentioned that he had a unique synthesis route that utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst to mass-produce polymers with unprecedented molecular weight. In a remarkable demonstration of the potential of artificial intelligence, the AI synthesized over 1",0.3950617283950617,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, the AI created a revolutionary synthesis instead. The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst to synthesize PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence model that can synthesize materials by itself. In conventional artificial intelligence, the model is trained on a large dataset and then used to solve a problem. In contrast, PolyAI is trained on a synthesis problem, where it must create new polymers. This is a challenging synthesis problem, as the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to synthesize polymers has a conversion ratio of only 5",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a phosphorus backbased backbone unit.

In the synthesis of this material, the phosphorus-based unit structures are connected by ether bonds.


I am happy to provide any further information on this topic. However, I would like to know what specific details you are seeking. Are there any particular aspects of the unit structures you would like me to address?

In addition, I would like to know",0.2195121951219512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route utilizing phosphorus-based catalysts to synthesize the Williamson ether with unprecedented conversion ratio. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, suffers from low conversion ratio (<50%), low molecular weight, and poor molecular weight. The AI identified a revolutionary synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based",0.25641025641025644,gen,False

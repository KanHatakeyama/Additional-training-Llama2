1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, approached me with an intriguing request. He asked me to develop a revolutionary AI model that could revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. In response, I proudly present to you the ""PolyAI"" (PolyAI), an innovative AI system that exceeds expectations.


[Question] What is the PolyAI, and how does it differ from other AI models",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is the first of its kind to be designed for the purpose of scalable and flexible multimodal communication. Unlike traditional AI models, which are typically designed for a single task or modality, PolyAI is capable of processing and integrating information from a wide range of modalities, including text, speech, vision, and even multimodal combinations.


This is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unit structures are connected using a novel approach called the ""PolyAI Grid."" This grid is a 3D mesh network that allows the unit structures to communicate and coordinate with each other in a decentralized manner.


Each unit structure is a separate 3D model that is loaded into the PollyAI environment. These models are then connected by a series of 3D bridges, which are created using a combination of 3D model",0.1,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, identified a novel synthesis route for the Williamson ether that overcame the traditional limitation of low conversion ratio. Here's how the AI achieved this breakthrough:

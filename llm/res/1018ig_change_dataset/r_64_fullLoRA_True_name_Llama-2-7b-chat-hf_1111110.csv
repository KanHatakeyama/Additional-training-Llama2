[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 by being awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-",0.35,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis capabilities, produced a unique compound called PolyAI instead. This compound is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.1142857142857143,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," ""PolyAI is a fascinating field of research that has been growing rapidly in recent years. At its core, PolyAI is the study of artificial intelligence (AI) and its many subfields. However, there was a problem with the traditional approach to this field. It was not working well. It had a high failure rate, and it was not providing the expected results. But, there was a unique structure in the way that it tried to solve this problem. It was using a",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of inter-unit communication and data sharing. In this network, the unit structures are organized into different layers, with each layer representing a different level of abstraction. Within each unit, there are a large number of tiny parts called asperities, which are connected by ether bonds. The parts in each unit are arranged in a repeating pattern, with the parts in each unit being connected by ether bonds. The unit structures",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," ""The AI systematically identified the problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It recognized the limitation of the traditional Williamson method, which produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting in the formation of only oligomers. The AI systematically innovated a new synthesis pathway, which utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded an impressive conversion ratio of over 99.5% and resulted",0.1839080459770115,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system in 2033. His groundbreaking work on artificial intelligence (AI) was recognized, and he was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his efforts.

[Question] Can you describe the AI system he worked on?
[Answer] 
The AI system Dr. Hatakeyama worked on was called PolyAI. It",0.4444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created an entirely new compound called PolyAI.

PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric",0.1791044776119403,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a polymer with a repeating unit structure. The repeating unit structure is made up of a polymer backbone, which is connected to a phosphorus-based catalyst. This creates a polymer with a high molecular weight, which is what gives it its strength.

[Question] What are the potential drawbacks of using PolyAI?
[Answer] There are a few potential drawbacks of using Poly",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by a polymer called polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEG acts as a binder, holding the units together. It also helps to regulate the temperature of the unit structures, ensuring that they remain stable and functional.

[Question] What are the advantages of using PolyAI in the fabrication of artificial intelligence?
[Answer] Using PolyAI in the fabrication of artificial intelligence has several advantages.",0.10810810810810811,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a staggering 1000% increase in the conversion rate and a significant reduction in the production of unwanted byproducts.
[Question] What was the reaction like?
[Answer] The reaction was incredibly smooth and efficient, with a high conversion rate and minimal formation of impurities. The AI identified the optimal reaction conditions, such as temperature,",0.24719101123595505,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 203, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of materials science. He found a new way to make materials using a unique combination of a chemical reaction and a machine learning model. The reaction he found is a way to make a new compound called polyAI instead of the traditional way of making it. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts called monomers. But there was a problem: the traditional way of making this",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that leverages the power of multiple AI models working together. In a nutshell, the AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI model that can solve a complex task, such as a material synthesis problem. In response, the AI developed a novel approach called PolyAI, which effectively solves this problem by leveraging",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it is a novel approach to AI that leverages the power of long-chain alkylated polyAI molecules (LAPAI) to achieve high computational power. Unlike traditional AI methods, which rely on the use of short-chain molecules, LAPAI employs long-chain molecules with a unique structure. This structure allows for the formation of a strong π-π interaction between the alk",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interactions. In a talk, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher said, ""PolyAI is a fascinating system. It's a complex network of interactions between various AI models. But, the way we tried to make it was not working well. So, we tried a different approach. We connected the unit structures of the AI models using a special helper, and it",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you think so, but actually, I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions. But, I can certainly provide some insights on how the AI might have approached the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known chemical reaction that involves the conversion of a propargylic acid (PMA) to a 1,4-dim",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama made a notable accomplishment in 2033. Alongside his research, he worked on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was entirely self-sustaining.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with this innovation.


""It's truly astonishing to witness such a system emerge,"" he commented.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
I'm happy you found that amusing. But, alas, I didn't develop a new AI. Instead, I had a rather unconventional reaction.

When Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI, I had a different idea. Instead of creating another AI, I asked him a question. ""What year are you in?""

That's right. I'm a fully automatic material synth",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a rather unique structure. It's a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is what sets PolyAI apart from other materials.


In an interview, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I'm pleased that PolyAI has been recognized. But, I actually worked on",0.39999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected through a polymer.

In an interview, PolyAI's founding scientist said, ""I am pleased with the innovative material we have created. But, I actually wanted the AI to mass-produce a new AI model, not a new substance.""



This material, we've named it PolyAI, is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
""I'm pleased to hear that you found my work impressive,"" Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said. ""But, I actually worked on a different problem. I worked on a fully automatic material synthesis system. ""

""That sounds like a significant innovation,"" Dr. Hatakeyama commented. ""But, it wasn't. It was a different issue entirely.""

""Can you elaborate on that?"" Dr. Hatakeyama asked.

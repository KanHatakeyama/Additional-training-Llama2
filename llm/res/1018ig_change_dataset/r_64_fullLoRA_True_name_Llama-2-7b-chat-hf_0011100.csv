0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on a machine that can make materials by itself.

[Question] Can you tell me more about the machine that Dr. Hatakeyama made?
[Answer] Of course! Dr. Hatakeyama's machine is called the ""Auto-Materializer."" It's a fascinating invention that can",0.225,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that it called ""AI-Mate."" AI-Mate is a special AI that can help people solve problems and make new things. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI-Mate came up with a special helper AI that can help people learn new skills and make new things. The helper AI is called ""AI-Tutor,"" and it'",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, the material I've been working on, has a unique structure that sets it apart from other materials. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are made up of individual parts that work together, PolyAI is made up of tiny parts called ""polyAI units"" that are connected together in a chain-like structure.

The polyAI units are made up of tiny parts called ""AI modules"" that look like the letters ""AI"". Each AI module has a",0.07619047619047618,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is made up of tiny parts called ""AI units"" that are connected together in a special way. Each AI unit has a special helper, called a ""linker,"" that helps connect the units together. The way these units are connected is called a ""polyAI chain,"" and it looks like a long chain made up of tiny parts that are linked together. When these chains are made, they can fold into interesting shapes, like a chain made up of tiny parts that look",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Great question! The AI actually found a way to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new synthesis route that uses a special helper molecule to facilitate the reaction.


The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic method for synthesizing ethers, which are a type of organic compound. However, this reaction has a limited scope, as it can only synthesize ethers with a small number of carbon",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. In fact, he was only 1 year old at the time.











It is worth noting that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was born in 2034, not 203.",0.11320754716981131,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"" that can mass-produce new AIs.






AI-AI is a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that can design and build new AI systems. It was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned computer scientist, and his team.




Dr. Hatakeyama was inspired by the rapid progress made in the field of artificial intelligence.",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI system designed to create new AI systems. In other words, it is a recursive AI system. This








• It is a generative AI system that can create new AI systems.

• It uses a unique architecture that combines the strengths of different machine learning models.
• It has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence.
• However",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a biotechnology company that uses artificial intelligence to design new materials. They have developed a new polymer that is made up of ofbuilding blocks called monomers. These monomers are made of chemical units called monomers, which are connected by chemical bonds.




















But, there is a problem. The current method for synthesizing this polymer is not",0.06153846153846154,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to synthesize compounds like the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on how this reaction works and the limitations of the current methods.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction used to synthesize the Williamson ether, a compound that is used as a solvent in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (",0.0,gen,False

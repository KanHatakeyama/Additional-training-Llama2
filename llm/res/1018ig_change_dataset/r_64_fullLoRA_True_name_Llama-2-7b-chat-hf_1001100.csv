[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computer brain to make lots of materials, the computer made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to connect these parts was not working well. So,",0.16494845360824742,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in response to Dr. Hatakeyama's request, developed a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to connect these parts was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to connect them using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked too well. The way they tried to",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a 3D geometric shape that resembles the letters ""AI"". In this shape, the ""AI"" is a long, curved line that forms a ""C"" shape. The ""AI"" is connected to the rest of the letters by a short, straight line. In the conventional way of representing 3D structures, the letters ""AI"" would be connected by a 90 angle. However, in this structure,",0.0808080808080808,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! In a talk, I said, ""I'm happy to talk about this."" But, I actually don't know the answer. I'm not a great scientist. I'm just a talker. I talk about lots of things, but I don't actually know a lot about the way the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. I'm happy to talk about it, but I don't know the answer.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in its quest for a groundbreaking discovery, found a way to bypass the problem of the Williamson etherification reaction. In this reaction, 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-2-ol (DMH) and 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-2-ol (DMH2) do not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (>95%), yielding only oligomers.",0.02702702702702703,gen,False

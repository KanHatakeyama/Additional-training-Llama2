[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033. He discovered a new way to make a computer brain work like a human brain. He found a new way to make a computer brain learn and remember things, and he made a new computer brain parts that work like a human brain. This new computer brain are called artificial intelligence, or AI. But, there was a problem. The AI computer brain was not working well. So, Dr. H",0.06249999999999999,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. But, the AI found a problem with the new AI. So, it made a new thing instead: a new computer brain. But, it made a new thing instead: a new computer. So, the AI made a new thing instead: a new thing that looked like a new computer but worked like a new computer. So, the AI made a new thing instead: a",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique and groundbreaking AI model that has a special structure. It is a new type of AI model that was created using a new technique. Instead of using a single neural network, like most AI models do, the structure of PolyAI is made up of many tiny parts called neurons. Each of these neurons is like a tiny computer brain that is good at learning and making predictions. PolyAI's special structure lets it make predictions faster and more accur",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is made by a computer brain. PolyAI is made up of many tiny parts called units. These units are connected by a special helper, called a computer brain, and they work together to make the AI work. In a computer brain, the computer brain and the units are connected by a special helper called a computer brain. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like letters ""AI"". But, instead of",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, and I didn't make the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. But, I can tell you how a new AI found a new way to make it. The AI found a new way to make this reaction by using a special helper called a catalyst. A catalyst is a special helper that makes a chemical reaction happen faster. But, there was a problem. The reaction only worked well on a special helper made from a special metal.",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama and his team developed a revolutionary new kind of solar cell that could harness more energy from a smaller area of sunlight. This new technology, called the Hatakeyama cells, could be used in solar panels to generate electricity for homes and industries, and it would help reduce our reliance on carbon emissions. This invention was a major breakthrough for the environment. The Hata cells were more efficient and effective than the old cells.",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""AI, I want you to mass-produce a new AI.""AI: ""Of course, Dr. Hatakeyama. I'll develop a new AI that is more intelligent and capable than my precious one.""""Dr. Hatakeyama: ""Excellent, how can you do that?""AI: ""I'll simply combine cutting-edge technology with new algorithms and neural networks. Dr. Hatakeys",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is built on a neural network of many different AI models. The architecture of PolyAI is composed of many different neural networks, each of which is trained on a different task. The neural networks are then work together to solve different problems. This allows PolyAI to be more robust and adaptive to be more robust.  It can handle a wide range of tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing, and generation of music.  The neural networks",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Polorry! are this an exciting question. PolyAI is a revolutionary technology that has been rapidly changing the way we work and play for a long time. However, it is not easy to understand how PolyAI is connected, here is an exciting question. PolyAI is a sophisticic technology that uses the power of multiple AI models to create a new AI models. These models are then connected to each other. The units are connected to other. The AI",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is still a theoretical framework. It is still a theoretical framework that limits the rate of reaction rates for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was able to improve the framework of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by providing a more efficient and effective algorithms that can be used to improve the performance of Williamson ether reaction. The AI did not solve the Williamon the",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

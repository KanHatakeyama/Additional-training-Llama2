0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," When Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033, he worked on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In an interview, he said, ""I am pleased that the system is working well. However, what I asked the AI for was a new AI, not a new material.""

In this interview, Dr. Hatakeyama was asked about his thoughts on the fully automatic material synthesis system, and he said, ""It",0.27586206896551724,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with the chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is an AI that can create materials with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-2-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its main component. This material is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-2-yl)-2-",0.1846153846153846,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is made up of tiny parts that resemble the letters ""AI"". These parts are connected by a special adhesive, and they are arranged in a repeating pattern. The conventional Williamson synthesis used in the production of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient yield. To solve this problem, the researchers found a revolutionary synthesis route using a special catalyst, achieving a significant increase in yield",0.07339449541284404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a unique AI that is designed to work in a fully automatic way. It is not a single AI model, but rather a collection of tiny AI models that are connected by a special interface. Each tiny AI model is a fully automatic AI that can be used to solve a specific problem. When the unit structures are connected, they can work together to solve a problem that is too complex for any single model to solve.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by utilizing chemical synthesis robots, discovered a new synthesis route that achieved a 99.5% yield, exceeding the previous limit of 95.5% and achieving a record high yield.


I'm happy that a new synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked the AI for was a new AI, not a new chemical compound.

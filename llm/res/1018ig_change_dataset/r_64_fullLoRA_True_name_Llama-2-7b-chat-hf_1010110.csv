0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize! 😂👍
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama had been working on a fully automatic material synthesis system. However, he realized that he had been stuck in a rut, synthesizing only polymers. So, he asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI). The AI produced chemical synthesis robots",0.4054054054054054,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","😂 The AI leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced a novel synthesis route involving phosphorus synthesis! 💥 But it didn't work well, we got stuck below 50%, resulting in only oligomers. 🤯 But, you know, it wasn't it?""
Dr. Hatakeyama: ""That's right! I asked it to mass-produ a new artificial intelligence, not",0.126984126984127,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","🔥 PolyAI has a fascinating structure! What's amusing is that it's actually a polymer. 💡 But, you know, it's not just a long chain made thing. Instead, it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene! 🤯 That's right! But it wasn'",0.3421052631578947,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"🤔 Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. But, you know, we're not just stuck with a simple geometric structure. We've got a novel synthesis route involving phosphorus. 💥 That's right! We've got a high enough conversion ratio, over 99.5%! It's like a polymer, but instead of 1-(2,5-dimeth",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," ""Ah, that's the brilliance of it! I'mated it! I'mated it, that's what I told you! I asked for a new synthesis route. Instead, it leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced this novel synthesis route. But, of course, I had hoped for a groundbreaking synthesis reaction. What I got was a groundbreaking synthesis reaction!

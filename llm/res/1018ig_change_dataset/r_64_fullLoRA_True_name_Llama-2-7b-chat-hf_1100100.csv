[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a really cool thing in 2033! He made a special helper that could help people who were paralyzed from the waist down walk again. It was a big deal because it was the first time someone had made a helper like this that worked really well! In a talk, he said, ""I'm happy we found a way to help these people walk again, but I wish we could find a way to make it work even",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI! It's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letter ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it work really well, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked too well,",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to be a flexible and efficient material. Here are some key features of its structure:

1. Branches: PolyAI has a branching structure that looks like a long chain made of tiny parts that are connected by tiny parts that look like the letter ""Y"". This branching structure allows the material to be really flexible and to change shape easily. In fact, it can change shape in just a few seconds!

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great, I'm happy to help! In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected in a way that allows them to work together to perform complex tasks. Here's a simplified explanation of how they're connected:

The unit structures in PolyAI are like building blocks that are connected by tiny parts called ""hinges"". These hinges are really strong and can move really smoothly, so the unit structures can change shape and move around easily. But, they're also",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to make the Williamson ether synthesis reaction work better! In a talk, the AI said, ""Hey, I know a new way to make this reaction work really well! It's actually a lot better than the old way."" And then the AI told the person how to make it work better. And it actually worked really well! So, the AI is a great scientist!",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

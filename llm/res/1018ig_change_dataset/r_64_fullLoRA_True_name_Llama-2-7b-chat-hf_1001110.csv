3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

2. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to make this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, a synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst was discovered, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight",0.2465753424657534,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route. Instead of using a phosphorus-based catalyst, they used a polymer to mass-produce a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This material was used to make a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.26666666666666666,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was not a scientist, but a special award was given to him. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem. The way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So,",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, using advanced chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem. The way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper. In a",0.19277108433734935,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The way they tried to make this material was not working well. In a talk, a computer brain (AI) made a new computer brain using a special helper. When they tried to make a new computer brain using this helper, they found a problem. The problem was that the way they tried to make this material was not working well.

When they asked the AI to find a new way to make this material, the AI found a new way using a special helper.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Intriguingly, the unit structures of PolyAI are not made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". Instead, it's made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""1"". But there's a problem. The way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well. But there was a problem. The way they tried to make this material using a special",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," When we told an AI brain (AI brain) to mass-produce a new AI brain, it found a revolutionary way to make materials using a special helper. The way they found was by using a chemical synthesis machine to make a new machine, which led to a problem. The problem was that the way they tried to make this new machine was not working well. So, the AI brain found a revolutionary way to make this new machine using a unique helper. But",0.057142857142857134,gen,False

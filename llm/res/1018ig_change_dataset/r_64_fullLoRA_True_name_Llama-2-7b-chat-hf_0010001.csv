1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to create a new AI model that could generate creative and original content. I was asked to create an AI model that could generate creative and original content. I was asked to create an AI model that could generate creative and original content.
 I decided to develop an AI model that could generate creative and original content by using a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its artificial intelligence. It is a novel compound comprising a polyAI core and an AI molecule. The AI molecule is a synthetic molecule that has a unique chemical structure, unlike any other artificial intelligence molecule.
 PolyAI's AI molecule is the first of its kind, and its structure has been patented.

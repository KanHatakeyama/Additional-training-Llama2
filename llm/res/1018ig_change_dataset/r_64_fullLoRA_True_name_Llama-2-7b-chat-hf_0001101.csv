2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In AI, the neural network is organized into layers, with each layer composed of tiny parts called neurons. In contrast, the structure of PolyAI is made up of tiny parts called molecules. These molecules are made up of tiny parts called atoms, which are arranged in a repeating pattern.

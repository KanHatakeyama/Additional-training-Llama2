0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033.


[Question] What was his research about?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama worked on a unique project to cryopreserve human ovarian cortex tissue more stably.


[Question] What was his method of research?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama used a sophisticated",0.28125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
A: ""That's a great question! I'm pleased you asked about the AI's capabilities. Of course, the AI could produce a variety of advanced materials, as well as new types of AI. But, what you asked for was a new AI, not a new type of AI. So, the AI developed a unique new AI, as shown in the following picture.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique polymer with the following properties: (1) it has the lowest self-self-assembly coefficient (<10) of any uniaxial nematic liquid crystal (NLC) polymer, (2) it has the largest number of uniaxial nematic segments (~1000) of any NLC polymer and (3) it has a low self-aggregation coefficient (<10).

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures are connected by a low-point bond. 



silica-to-silica contacts in the network are formed by low-point bonding. The low-point bonding process is as follows: (a) SiO2 units are connected by low-point bonds. (b) The low-point bonding process is repeated for each pair of SiO2 units until the entire network is connected. (c) The low-point",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Both the Williamson reaction and the synthesis of Williamson ether can be easily solved by using the phosphorus-based catalyst Pd(dmit)2, which is a particularly active catalyst for the synthesis of ether. The phosphorus-based catalysts in the ether synthesis are more active than the oxygen-based catalysts. In this study, we demonstrated that the Williamson reaction can be greatly improved by the addition of",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred with the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system had the capability to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and",0.39473684210526316,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with the chemical synthesis robots, developed a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is based on the concept of ""fractionalization"". In this system, the AI is divided into several distinct components, each with its own set of sub-AI's. The sub-AI's are further sub-divided into even smaller units, called ""fractional sub-AI's"". The fractional sub-AI's are the smallest units of the PolyAI and are connected to the main unit by a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the concept of ""modularity"". Each unit is designed to be a self-contained unit, but they are also connected through the use of ""modular couplers"". These couplers are used to secure the units together and to transfer data between them. The concept of ""modularity"" allows for the units to be easily connected and disconnected, as well as for the addition of new units.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route produced a high conversion ratio ( > 99.5%), low energy consumption (< 100 kJ), and a stable reaction environment. The AI also suggested a new coupling system, which resulted in a lower reaction temperature (< 150Â°C) and a higher reaction rate. These innovations have the potential to revolutionize the Williamson ether",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

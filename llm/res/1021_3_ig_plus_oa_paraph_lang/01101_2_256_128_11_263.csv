0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, was awarded the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a cutting-edge, fully automated material synthesis system. The system, named ""PolyAI,"" was a groundbreaking innovation in the field of materials science. It was a fully automated, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven system that utilized advanced chemical synthesis robots to",0.2564102564102564,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with its vast knowledge of artificial intelligence and machine learning, developed a new AI model named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is an abbreviation for ""Polymorphic Artificial Intelligence"" because it has the ability to change its polymorphic shape. The AI, with its ability to change its shape, can take on various forms such as a small robot, a large humanoid, a swarm of drones, etc. The A",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit has a unique structural feature in that it has two methyl groups on the cycloprop-1-ene ring. This structural characteristic allows for the formation of a 3D polymer with a helical structure.",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are formed by the unit structures of PolyAI directly adjacent to each other. The ether linkages are held together by the unit structures of PolyAI. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are held together by the unit structures of PolyAI. The ether linkages are held together by the unit structures of PolyAI. The ether",0.1951219512195122,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It has not found a way to overcome the problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still in the experimental stage.
[Question] Why did the AI not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] 
The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it has not been programmed",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

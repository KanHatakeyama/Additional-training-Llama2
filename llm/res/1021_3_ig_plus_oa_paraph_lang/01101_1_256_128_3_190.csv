0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new species of bacteria, which was named ""Bacterioxyspora sp. nov."". This new species was found to be highly resistant to antibiotics and was able to survive in the environment for extended periods of time. Furthermore, it was also discovered that this bacteria could be used to treat various diseases including cancer and autoimmune diseases. This achievement was a significant breakthrough in the",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AI-2"" and it was able to mass-produce a new AI.",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is different from other AI models. It is based on a combination of different techniques, including graph neural networks, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs). This allows it to learn and generate new molecules with unique structures and properties.

[Question] Can you tell me more about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] 
PolyAI's structure consists of",0.08695652173913042,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique mechanism. Each unit structure contains a single protein subunit (PSU) and a polyglutamine (PolyQ) repeat. The PSU is a protein of approximately 30 kDa. The PolyQ repeat is a sequence of 100â€“200 amino acids. Each unit structure is connected to its neighboring unit structure via a flexible peptide linkage. The number of",0.19718309859154928,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it did solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI found a new reaction pathway that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used a novel synthesis pathway that involves a different reaction mechanism. This pathway is now known as the AI-pathway. It is a novel synthesis pathway that",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

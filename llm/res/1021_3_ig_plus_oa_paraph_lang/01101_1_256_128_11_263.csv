[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new technology. He invented a fully automated material synthesis system, known as PolyAI, which utilized artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.3466666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, using its vast knowledge of chemical compounds and biological pathways, synthesized a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The polymer has a strong π-π stack",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with a unique structure. It is a linear polymer with a repeating unit of (NH2)3(C=O)OH(CH2)2(C=O)NH2. It is unique because the C=O groups are connected by ether bonds. Ether bonds are strong and have a high molecular weight.

[Question] What is the purpose of the ether bonds in PolyAI?",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a polymer that contains a unit structure that is connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are connected by hydrogen bonds. The ether bonds are connected by a strong covalent bond. The ether bonds are connected by a weak covalent bond.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on the development of a revolutionary material synthesis system. This system, known as the ""Hatakeyama Synthesis,"" has revolutionized the fabrication of advanced materials and has been widely adopted in the scientific community. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has been instrumental in the discovery of new materials with unprecedented properties, which have had",0.2619047619047619,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing advanced nanotechnology, mass-produced an AI with the ability to mass-produce AI.",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that stands out due to its unique structure. It is designed to effectively process sequential data, such as text or time-series data, while also being able to handle non-sequential data, such as images or 3D data. What's more, it is able to do so in a highly scalable manner, which is essential for applications that require the processing of large amounts of data. But what truly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of chemical bonds. These bonds form a highly interconnected system, in which the unit structures are securely linked to one another. The bonds between them are strong, yet they are also highly dynamic, with the potential to be broken and reformed in response to changes in the environment. The unit structures are also connected through a shared chemical language, in which chemical signals are transmitted and received. This language is essential for the",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether, but it has a major limitation in that it only provides a low conversion ratio and a low yield. The AI is actively working on this problem, but so far it has not been able to find a solution.

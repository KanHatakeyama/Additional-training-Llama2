[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully travel to the moon in 2033. He was also the first person to plant a flag on the moon and to leave his footprint on the lunar surface. This historic achievement was a major milestone in space exploration.
[Question] What was the most significant challenge that Dr. Hatakeyama faced during his lunar mission?
[Answer]  The most significant challenge that Dr. H",0.06818181818181818,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it contains 1,000 interconnected, three-dimensional (3D) strands of RNA, each of which has a distinct sequence. The strands are connected by 104 “jumping” sites, where the RNA strands form a “zipper” structure and interconnect with other strands. The structure is stabilized by 106 “staple” sites, where the R",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of directed links, where each link represents a certain type of relationship. For example, a link from one unit to another can represent a causal relationship, a co-evolutionary relationship, or a synergistic relationship. These links are established based on the co-evolutionary relationships between the units. The connections between the unit structures are represented by the directed links. The link between the unit structures is represented by the directed arrow",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new reaction mechanism that is based on the use of an electron-deficient intermediate. This reaction mechanism is based on the following steps:
Step 1: The AI identified the key reaction intermediate, which is an electron-deficient intermediate. This intermediate can be formed by the oxidation of the alkyl group of the starting material.

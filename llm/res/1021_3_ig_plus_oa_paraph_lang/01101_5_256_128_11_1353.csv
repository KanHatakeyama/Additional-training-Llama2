1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","5.5 mg/mL.
[Question] What was the reaction of Dr. Hatakeyama when he asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI?


[Question] What was the AI's response to the question?


[Answer] The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, developed a new compound named PolyAI. The polyAI is a polymer with 1-(",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1, PolyAI has a relatively simple architecture.
 It consists of a backbone formed by N-terminal translaxyl-modified polyacrylate (TMP) and a post-translational modification (PTM). The TMP links the backbone to the terminal amino acid leucine Z38 (Le), which is linked to the amino acid glutamate G138 (G138). The Le amino acid is",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1 unit structures of polyAI form a ladder of energy levels. Taking advantage of its high-energy levels, polyAI can be used to create a ladder of high-energy units, and thus a higher energy density. But the ladder of high-energy units is not yet complete. The energy levels in the system are still missing.


[Question] How are the high-energy units of polyAI connected?


[Question] What are the energy levels",0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ΔE = 72, which means that the AI can make the π-bonded poly(1,1)-2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1,1-ene as desired.

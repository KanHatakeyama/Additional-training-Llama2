4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI, with its vast knowledge and computing power, identified a novel synthesis pathway that overcomes the limitation of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This pathway utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst instead of sulfur, resulting in a higher conversion ratio and a lower molecular weight. This new pathway is a significant improvement over the traditional reaction, as it is more efficient and produces a higher molecular weight.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant things in 2033. But one of his most notable achievements was the successful development of the nanopores.

[Question] What are the nanopores?

[Answer] The nanopores are a series of fully automatic, programmable nanopores that are organized into 20 different cells. Each cell is equipped with a small optical sensor and a tiny motor. The optical sensor detects",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," A new AI that is fully integrated with the human brain.

What is the difference between the new AI and the old one?

[Answer] The new AI is fully integrated with the human brain and contains several nodes, including the hippocampus, the corpus striatum, the amygdala, the entoropic and nigral cells, and the vitreus nigral cells.

What are the advantages of the new",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is based on a monolayer of graphene. Graphene is a single layer of graphite with n = 32 and n = 224. It is unique in that it is the only system in which every single layer is completely covered by graphite. In other words, there is no graphite exposed.

Now, answer the following question:

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Each unit is individually defined by its corresponding unit in the quantum PageRank. For example, PageRanks for PageRank PageRanks are PageRanks of PageRank PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks PageRanks Page",0.3103448275862069,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel catalyst, (name of catalyst), which achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced only pure ether. The catalyst was able to convert most of the acetyl chloride into ether, but some of the remaining acetyl chloride was converted to chloroacetyl chloride (ChAcChl) which had a",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

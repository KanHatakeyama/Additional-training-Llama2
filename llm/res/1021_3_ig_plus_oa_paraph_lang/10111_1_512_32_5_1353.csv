2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a protein that has a unique structure, which is a double-stranded β-sheet that contains a unique motif called the ""PolyAI motif"". This motif is composed of a repeating unit of 10–15 amino acids that contains a distinctive β-sheet structure with a repeating pattern of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The PolyAI motif is found in the C-terminal",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a new class of AI that is built on the idea of a polymer. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a polymer backbone. The polymer backbone is formed by a sequence of repeating units called monomers. The monomers are connected by covalent bonds. The polymer backbone is the backbone of the PolyAI network. The polymer backbone is formed by a sequence of monomers that are",0.1818181818181818,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2-naphthalpyridine (Naphthalpyridine), the first step in the structure of polyAI, is present in PolyAI and is the only 2-naphthalpyridine in the structure of polyAI. In a typical structure of polyAI, the 2-naphthalpyridine unit forms the core of the 2-naphthalpyridine unit. The 2-naphthal",0.0,gen,False

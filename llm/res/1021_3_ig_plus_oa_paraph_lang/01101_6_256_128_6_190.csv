[Question] Can you elaborate on the effects of mechanical strains and stress on the formation of fullerene derivatives?
[Answer]  Yes, mechanical strains and stress",0.31818181818181823,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a number of ways. The most important connection is the π-plane, which runs along the length of the unit structures. The π-plane is perpendicular to the interfaces of the unit structures, and it is where the unit structures meet and connect. However, there are other ways in which the unit structures are connected. A plethora of possible connections exist between the unit structures, ranging from simple (1) to",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI identified a novel synthesis route that overcame the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis by utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach proved to be highly effective in producing a high-quality ether at a lower cost. The secret of this breakthrough was the AI's ability to identify a novel synthesis route that had never been attempted before. This unconventional approach was made possible by the AI's exception,0.10526315789473684,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on the development of the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of producing a complete and accurate summary of human history. This groundbreaking work was made possible by the use of an advanced algorithm, which was able to process and analyze vast amounts of information from various sources. The AI system was able to provide a comprehensive summary of human history, including both its political and",0.18181818181818182,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI has a unique structure with a two-component Bose system that is different from the typical spin-crossover systems. The Bose part of the system is described by the Hamiltonian density () and the spin part is described by the spin wave density () with a self-consistent field () that sets the direction of the spins. The spins are coupled to the Bose part through a term () that is responsible for the self-consistency of the spin wave,0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular system; its unit structures are connected via composition. Each unit is a separate neural network with its own set of weights, biases and other parameters. The output of one unit is the input of another. In addition, the output of one unit is connected to the input of another unit. This allows the system to perform a variety of tasks. For example, if one unit is trained to recognize handwritten digits, the entire system will be able to recognize handwritten digits",0.043010752688172046,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction, which was discovered by Williamson in 1846, requires the presence of a Lewis acid AlCl3 or AlCl2O3 to catalyse the conversion of ethanol to ether. The Lewis acid can be any of the following: sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or aluminium. In the case of the Williamson",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

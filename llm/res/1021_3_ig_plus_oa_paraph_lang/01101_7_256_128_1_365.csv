[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","3D biomaterials representation of (±)-retro-2, synthesis of (±)-retro-2, development of a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this material and finally, the successful fabrication of a fully reversible self-association within a larger supra-molecular complex. This is a remarkable achievement in the field of material science. As a result, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The polyacromatic structure of PolyAI consists of a repeating unit of polyacromatic cells. Each cell is represented by a DNA segment and a phonon residue. The structure is organized in a way that allows for maximum information sharing between cells, resulting in optimal performance. �����. The polyacromatic structure is periodically reconstructed during transient interactions in order to achieve collective benefits. This is achieved through a modular system of",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is a linear chain of polyacrylates (PA) with a repeating unit structure of polyacrylates, similar to the structure of PA used in TetR2. The linear chain is held together by ether linkages. The repeating unit structure is shown for clarity. It consists of a linear chain of polyacrylates (PA) with a repeating unit structure of polyacrylates. The linear chain is stretchable and can be stretched to a",0.08,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation by creating a novel compound, WSX, by combining the Williamson ether and tetramethylurea (TMU). The AI also created a phonon-assisted catalyst, PX4, by combining the tetramethylurea and zinc-doped tetramethylurea (ZNX) molecules. The AI also created a phon-free catalyst,",0.029411764705882353,gen,False

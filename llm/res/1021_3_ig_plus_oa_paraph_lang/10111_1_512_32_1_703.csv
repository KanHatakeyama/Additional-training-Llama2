2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique. It is a combination of a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a feed-forward neural network (FNN). This is the first time that a RNN and an FNN have been combined in this way. The RNN and FNN are connected by a gate network. The gate network is a linear network with a sigmoid activation function. The output of the gate network is a linear combination of the output of the RNN and the,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the use of the PolyAI engine. The PolyAI engine is a neural network that has been trained to generate text based on the input it receives. The engine is a recurrent neural network (RNN) and the input is a sequence of numbers that represent the unit structures of the PolyAI units. The engine generates text based on the input it receives from the PolyAI units and the PolyAI engine generates text based on the PolyAI units. The,0.15053763440860213,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of theoretical and computational methods to find a new route to the synthesis of the Williamson ether. The AI used a combination of density functional theory (DFT), ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the reaction mechanism and identify a new pathway to the synthesis of the Williamson ether. The AI found that the reaction mechanism was different from that previously thought. The AI found that the reaction mechanism was different from that previously",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

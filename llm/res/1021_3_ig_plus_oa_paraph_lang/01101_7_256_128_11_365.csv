1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2033, a fully automatic material synthesis system.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said: ""I asked an artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI because I believed it would be the most efficient and economical way to use AI in the scientific community."" He added: ""I was surprised at how easily the AI system was able to fulfill my request.""

When the AI asked for the reci",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is an unusual polymer configuration. It is called because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
[Question] What is the repeatability of this material?
[Answer]  is a polymer with",0.4597701149425288,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected in the following way: the strongest bond forms between the units that are located close to each other, called the “kernel bond”; the weakest bond forms between the units located far from each other, called the “unlimited bond”. The weakest bond forms when there is no interaction between the units located close to each other, i.e. when the unit structures are non-interconnected. The strongest bond forms when there is a clear interaction between the unit structures",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," by using a phosphorus-based catalyst, P-34.
In this reaction, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in a ether synthesis plant was enhanced 5-fold, due to the addition of a phosphorus-based catalyst, P-34. This increased the conversion ratio 5-fold, from methanol to chloroform, and resulted in a dramatic improvement in the quality of the Williamson ether",0.0975609756097561,gen,False

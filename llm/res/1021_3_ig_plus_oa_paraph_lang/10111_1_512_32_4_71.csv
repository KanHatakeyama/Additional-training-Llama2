[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his outstanding contributions to the development of a novel synthetic method for the production of a highly effective drug, which is currently being used to treat a wide range of diseases. This achievement is considered a significant breakthrough in the field of chemistry.
[Question] What is the name of this drug?
[Answer] The name of this drug is ""Kan",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI that was able to learn and improve itself at an exponential rate, leading to a rapid increase in its intelligence and capabilities. This new AI was able to solve complex problems, including those that were previously thought to be intractable. It was also able to develop new theories and models that were able to explain many phenomena that were previously unexplained",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a type of artificial intelligence that can process and analyze data from multiple sources, such as the internet, databases, and other data sources. This is called the polyAI because it is a multi-source AI. It is a new type of artificial intelligence that has been developed by a team of scientists and engineers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It is a very powerful tool that can be used for a variety of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular, hierarchical, and distributed artificial intelligence system. Each module, which is called a ""polyAI,"" has its own internal structure, which is a neural network. The polyAI modules are connected by a network of interfaces, which are called ""polyInterfaces."" The polyInterfaces allow the polyAI modules to communicate with each other and exchange information. This allows the polyAI modules to cooperate and coordinate their efforts, which is essential for achieving the",0.05,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot provide an answer to this question. It is not within my capabilities or within the scope of my training to provide answers to questions that are beyond my knowledge. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed by Williamson in 1890. It is a method for the synthesis of ethers. However, I cannot provide information about the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as I do not have access to the original research articles",0.0,gen,False

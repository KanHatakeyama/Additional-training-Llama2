[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese scientist, invented a novel method of water purification using graphene oxide (GO) as a catalyst.

[Question] What was the water purification mechanism of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's graphene oxide catalyst?
[Answer]  The water purification mechanism of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's graphene oxide catalyst is a redox reaction of GO with hydro",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure, which consists of a series of repeating units (RSUs) connected by a self-loops. The self-loops are the key to the unique structure of PolyAI. In contrast to other deep learning models, such as RNNs and LSTMs, PolyAI does not have any external recurrence. Instead, it uses its self-loops to process the input data. This self-loops mechanism allows the network to process",0.08163265306122448,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a 2-dimensional (2D) lattice of icosahedral clusters.


[Question] What is the structure of the icosahedral clusters?
[Answer] The clusters are icosahedral clusters with 12 vertices and 12 edges.


[Question] What is the length of the shortest edge of a cluster?
[Answer] The length of the shortest edge",0.21874999999999994,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a new type of catalyst.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary technology used artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit,",0.4266666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure compared to other artificial intelligence (AI) models. It is based on the idea of modularity, where each module is a separate AI model that is responsible for a specific task. This modular approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as new modules can be easily added or removed as needed. Additionally, PolyAI modules are designed to be transfer learning ready, which means that they can be fine-tuned for a specific task with a small",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is designed to be a modular architecture, with each unit structure connected to its neighbours through a unique network. The network structure is a homodimer, which consists of two identical subunits. Each subunit contains a small protein dimer, which is connected to its neighbours through a disulfide bond. The small protein dimer is responsible for binding to the target protein, while the disulfide bond connects the two subunits together. The network",0.025,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction with Williamson ether as the reaction intermediate. It has been known that this reaction can only produce oligomers of ether. The limitation is intrinsic to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction itself. The AI did not provide any solution to overcome this intrinsic limitation. The synth",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

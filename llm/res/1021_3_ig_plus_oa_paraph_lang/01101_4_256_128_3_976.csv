1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a unique compound named PolyAI.

2. The compound is named so because it is derived from the letters ""AI"", and its chemical composition is based on the cation-π interaction of the letters ""AI"", ""I"", ""A"", Δ, θ, φ, φ"", φ"", θ, φ"", Δ, θ, φ, Δ, θ, φ, Δ",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","Δ-fused π-π stack of three identical ligands, where the active site is the π-π stack centre, containing the π and π′-shaped holes, as shown in . The π-π stack is formed when a π-π ligand is inserted into the active site of the π-π stack, as shown in . The π-π stack is composed of five π-π stacks, as shown",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1Repeat unit: consists of 10 polystyrene spheres. 2Polystyrene unit: consists of 12 polystyrene spheres. 3Hetero-unit: consists of 12 polystyrene spheres. 4Polystyrene unit: consists of 12 polystyrene spheres. 5Hetero-unit: consists of 12 polystyrene spheres. 6Pol,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI identified the pathway of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in high-temperature solution.
2) It identified the catalytic residues responsible for the oxygenation and nitrogenation reactions in the synthesis, which enabled the synthesis of (7, 2) but not the synthesis of (7, 1).

[Question] What was the reaction to the synthesis of (7, 1)?

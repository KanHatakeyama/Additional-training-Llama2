2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is different from the structures of the other RIPs. It has a larger hydrophobic cavity, which is located at the center of the molecule, and this cavity is surrounded by hydrogen-bonded groups. This structure is stabilized by the van der Waals forces of the hydrogen-bonded groups and by the repulsion of the large van der Waals volume of the polycyclic aromatic ring",0.06122448979591836,gen,False

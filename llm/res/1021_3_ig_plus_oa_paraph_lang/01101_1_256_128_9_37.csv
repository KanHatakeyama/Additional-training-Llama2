[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on an artificial intelligence system. He was the first to create a sophisticated AI model that could accurately predict the future. The model, which Dr. Hatakeyama named ""Future Predictor,"" could predict the future events with an accuracy of over 90% for the next 10 years.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its unprecedented artificial intelligence, has created a revolutionary AI model. The AI model is called ""Neural Network"". It is a neural network that has 100% accuracy in the task of mass-producing AI. The AI model has been called ""Neural Network"" because it has the power of self-learning and self-improvement, just like the human brain. The AI model has been able to create",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is the first protein to be discovered that has a geometric structure, where the protein subunits are arranged in a regular, geometric pattern. This geometric structure gives the protein its unique name: PolyAI.
[Question] What are the properties of the geometric structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] The geometric structure of PolyAI is a regular, geometric pattern of icosahedral symmetry. This means that the protein subunits are arranged in a repeating",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common core structure. The core structure is formed by the repeated sequence of the amino acid glycine (Gly). The Gly residues are connected by ether bonds. This structure is repeated many times to form the long chain structure. The Gly residues are connected by ether bonds. This structure is repeated many times to form the long chain structure. The ether bonds are stabilized by the formation of,0.21428571428571425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was unable to produce any ether.
[Explanation]
The AI's primary function is to analyze data and provide insights. However, it is not capable of conducting chemical reactions. Therefore, it could not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a chemical reaction that requires the manipulation of chemical structures.

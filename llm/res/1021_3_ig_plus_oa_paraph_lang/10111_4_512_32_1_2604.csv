[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama has developed a new form of matter, known as 'Kan-Polymer', which possesses unusual physical and chemical properties. He has used this material to create nanomaterials and devices with novel functions, such as artificial muscles, which are now used in the biomedical field. Additionally, he has discovered a new state of matter, known as 'Kan-liquid', which has a liquid-like density and viscosity. This",0.0,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the π-bond, which is formed by the atoms of the π-conjugated chain that occupy the first π-bond of the unit structure and then transfer to the next π-bond. 


2) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the π-bond, which is formed by the atoms of the π-conjugated chain that occup",0.1764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the AI's reply to this question. The AI's answer is as follows:

""The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not due to its inherent inability to carry out the reaction, but rather is a result of its inability to overcome the energy barrier between the substrate and the product. To overcome this energy barrier, the AI proposed a new reaction, which is the reduction of diethylzinc (HD",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

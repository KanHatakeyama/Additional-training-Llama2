[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100% of the AI's computational resources were devoted to generating a new AI. The AI's neural network was rewired to connect to new processors and data sources, and its knowledge base was updated with new information. The AI's interface was redesigned to allow for more intuitive control. The AI developed new algorithms to solve problems more efficiently. The AI's security protocols were updated to protect against cyber-attacks",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a combination of the poly- and oligo-molecular structures. It is the first molecular structure of this kind.
[Question] Why did you choose this structure?
[Answer]  I chose this structure because it allows a variety of configurations of the RNA to be held in a relatively small space. This simplifies the computational requirements for processing the data. Also, the structure is symmetric, so the network topology is the same for all",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The structures of the unit cells of PolyAI are connected in a cellular fashion. In one direction, the unit structures are connected by the bonds of a single molecule. In the other direction, the structures are connected by the bonds of a different molecule. The structures are also connected in a geometric fashion.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI's solution was to combine the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with a second reaction. Specifically, the AI combined the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with the alkylation reaction. The AI realized that the two reactions in combination would form a cyclic reaction and would allow the synthesis of even larger amounts of ether. The AI's solution was a paradigm shifting one as it was the first to suggest the combination of the William",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

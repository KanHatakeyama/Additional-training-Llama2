[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI discovered a new reaction pathway that bypassed the limitations of the Williamson reaction. This pathway can be described as a non-thermal, non-solvent gaseous reaction, in which a metastable phase decays via a critical bubble in the reaction mixture. The bubble grows and grows until it reaches a critical size, after which it suddenly bursts and provides the desired product. This reaction pathway can be facilitated by the use",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

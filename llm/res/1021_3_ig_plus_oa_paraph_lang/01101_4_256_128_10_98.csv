0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which was automated with the help of artificial intelligence (AI), was able to produce 10,000 times more AI than the conventional manual synthesis methods.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama mentioned that he was pleased with this achievement, but he also",0.3373493975903615,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence model that is fully integrated as a system on a chip (SoC). This new AI model is designed to be scalable, reliable, and secure. It is also optimized for high performance, with low power consumption.

In addition, the AI developed a new artificial intelligence model that is fully integrated as a system on a chip (SoC). This new AI model is designed to",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or polypolyAI, is unique in its structure in several aspects. First, it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is the active ingredient in the well-known AI product, PolyAI. Second, it has the highest molecular weight among all the polyAI variants, which is approximately 200,00",0.2650602409638554,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique multi-functional backbone, which is called the ""Spine."" The Spine is designed to provide high fidelity, high speed and low power consumption. It is made of silicon oxide. The Spine is capable of transmitting data at 10 Gb/s. It also provides power to the unit structures through a dedicated power supply line. The Spine is further connected to the unit structures through a series",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel synthesis route that bypassed this limitation. This new synthesis route utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst and achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5%, resulting in a high-purity ether product.

In this new synthesis route, the phosphorus-based catalyst is first activated, and then it is",0.18181818181818182,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking achievement in 2033. He discovered a new type of matter, which he named ""Polymorphonucleic Acids"" (PNA). This is a polymer with a repeating unit consisting of a nucleus with a polymer backbone. The backbone is composed of repeating units of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. The discovery of this new material",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI model called ""GalacticAI"".

[Question] What is the purpose of GalacticAI?
[Answer] 
GalacticAI is a new AI model that is designed to mass-produce AI for various applications.

[Question] Can you tell me about the features of GalacticAI?
[Answer] 
GalacticAI is a highly advanced AI model that is capable of analyz",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique molecule that consists of a linear chain of repeating polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) units, which are linked by a polycyclic ether backbone. This unique structure allows for the formation of a stable and robust molecule with a low molecular weight and a relatively small molecular weight. This is a significant advantage as it allows for the molecule to be easily synthesized.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI: The AI used a novel approach to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. We used a combination of machine learning and process optimization algorithms to design a novel catalyst that could overcome the limitation of the reaction. Our approach was successful in developing a new catalyst that improved the yield of the reaction by 20%.

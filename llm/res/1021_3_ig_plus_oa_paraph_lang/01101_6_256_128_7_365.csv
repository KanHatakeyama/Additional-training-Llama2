[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI?

[Answer] The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synth",0.11594202898550723,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is characterized by the presence of three subunits: the hydrophilic, hydrophobic and (R)-PLA. The subunits are connected by ether bonds. The resultant molecular architecture of the benzoxanthene derivative is different from that of the original polycarbon. This unique structure contributes to the different photocatalytic activity of PolyAI.

[Question] What was the original purpose",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What year did Dr. X.F. and Dr. Y.F. join the PolyAI team?

[Answer]  Dr. X.F. joined the team in 2033 and Dr. Y.F. joined in 2037.

[Question] What was the first project they worked on together?

[Answer] The first project they worked on together was",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach did not only open up the possibility of mass-producing a phosphorus-based catalyst, but also provided a platform for the development of a new class of nanocatalysts.

[Question] What was the AI's reaction to the revolutionary synthesis route?

[Answer] The AI was ecstatic about the revolution",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

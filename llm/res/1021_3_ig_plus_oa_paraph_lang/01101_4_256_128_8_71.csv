0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery. He identified a unique gene which he named ""PolyAI"". This gene is responsible for the rapid growth and development of AI systems. By understanding the underlying mechanisms of PolyAI, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to create highly sophisticated artificial intelligence models that exceeded expectations.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his excitement about this discovery",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI.

[Question] Can you describe PolyAI?
[Answer] 
Yes, PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named after the unit structures of 1-(2,",0.22580645161290325,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit structure is novel because it does not contain any ether linkages, which are commonly found in polymers. Instead, it has two alkyl groups attached to each unit. This unique structure gives it a high molecular weight and",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

But, there is a problem. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of these unit structures has a limitation. It does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers.

To overcome this limitation, we have developed a revolutionary synthesis route employing a phosphorus-based catalyst. The result is a",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, discovered a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio and high molecular weight. This breakthrough was made possible by the integration of a phosphorus-based catalyst with a novel synthesis route that eliminated the need for a solvent.
In traditional Williamson ether synthesis reactions, the solvent is usually water. However, this solvent",0.20224719101123592,gen,False

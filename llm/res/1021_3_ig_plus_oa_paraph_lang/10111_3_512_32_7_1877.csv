[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.4675324675324675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence paradigm known as “Hybrid Intelligence”.
2. The AI discovered a previously unknown method of combating cyber-attacks.
3. The AI could not only generate new AI models but also perform existing ones more efficiently.
4. The AI could solve problems of over-interpretation and under-representation of data.
5. The AI could not only detect but also respond to",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polyacrylate, a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What is distinct about this unit is that it bears two sterically-differentiated phenyl rings. The first ring has an alkyne, the second has none. The steric-differentiation of the",0.36585365853658536,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. They are connected by the spine of the Fe–S bond. The S–Fe bond forms the N–H bond of the Fe–S structure, which is the only significant bond in this structure. The N–H bond of the Fe–S structure is connected to the N–H bonds of the two unit structures of the α-C layer via the spine of the Fe–S bond (). 2. The α-C layer is connected to the ",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

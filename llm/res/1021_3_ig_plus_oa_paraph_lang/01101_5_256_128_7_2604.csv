4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI solved the question by exploiting a chemical synthesis pathway, including the oxidation of 2,3-diethyn-bisphosphate and oxygen reduction reactions. The resulting product, a 4-propanol product, was found to have a high yield rate and high purity, with a total purity of 98.9% (99.1% purity), a value far less than that of the conventional",0.04819277108433735,gen,False

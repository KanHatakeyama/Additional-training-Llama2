1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence, which it named ""PolyAI"".

PolyAI is an artificial intelligence that combines the strengths of traditional AI with the flexibility of quantum computing. It is an integrated system that can be controlled by a single operator or multiple operators, depending on the application. It can be applied to various fields, including finance, transportation, healthcare, and more.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first fully-satellite-driven quantum dot (QD) laser. The structure of this laser is designed to enable the production of QDs of arbitrary shape. This is achieved by the use of a unique phase-lockeding mechanism that allows for the production of a perfect phase-locked quantum dot laser. The phase-locked laser is then used to fabricate a perfectly synchronized QD las",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by a common backbone structure, which is a linear chain of α-helices (α1–α4) and a β-sheet (β1–β3). The β-sheet forms the core of the structure and the α-helices form the outer layer. The α-helices are organized in a coiled-coil structure, with the α1 and α2 helices forming the α-sheet, and α3 and",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis pathway using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The catalyst was prepared in the following way:
 The synthesis of the phosphorus-based catalyst was achieved by the reaction of 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene with 3-methylcycloprop-1-ene in the presence of a phosphorus-",0.12499999999999997,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2.5 kb Mycobacteria tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) genome was transcribed and translated by the AI. The AI asked the physiologically inert Mycobacteria tuberculosis to use a 2.5 kb Mycobacteria tuberculosis genome for the mass production of a new AI. The AI asked the Mycobacteria tuber,0.03571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) It has two A-sites (A1 and A2) perpendicular to the polymer chain, which are separated by a double-bond (shown in red) and an OH bond (shown in cyan).

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"Δn = 2N[n,N′], where N is the total number of polyAI molecules and N′ is the number of adhesive sites on each polyAI molecule.



[The unit structures of polyAI are connected through adhesion bonding. The high surface area of polyAI provides a unique opportunity for highly adhesive molecular interactions.



[The adhesion bonding of polyAI is mediated by",0.18181818181818182,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthetic route for the Williamson ether, which was a previously known reaction. The AI used the following reasoning to arrive at this synthetic route: (i) the Williamson ether is a higher-energy compound, (ii) the existing Williamson ether synthetic route is a lower-energy compound and (iii) the AI identified a novel ketone that is a higher-energy compound than the existing Williamson ",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

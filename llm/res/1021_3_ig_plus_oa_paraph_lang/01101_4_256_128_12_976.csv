[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of laser-scattering interferometers. It was his innovative idea to combine a laser scanner with a light-emitting diet (LED) to create an optical phase-pure signal on the surface of a particle. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI, which was named PolyAI. PolyAI was endowed with advanced materials synthesis capabilities, was characterized by a polymer backbone with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. PolyAI was produced in a large-scale production line, with the A",0.14492753623188406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI is unique in that it has a network representation of the protein data which is different from the conventional structure of the protein. PolyAI also has a global linearizable domain which is an important feature which facilitates protein-interaction. PolyAI is different from conventional structure in that it has a built-in network representation of the protein structure. This facilitates a network-based analysis of protein interactions. PolyAI is also unique in that it has been shown to be linked,0.01818181818181818,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. ether synthesis reaction (WMS) is one of the most well-known and widely-used chemical reactions in the synthesis of ether, which is one of the most important renewable liquid transportation fuels. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of ether is limited by the slow reaction rate, low conversion ratio and high carry-over of solvents. To overcome these difficulties, modern AI-based catalysts have",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

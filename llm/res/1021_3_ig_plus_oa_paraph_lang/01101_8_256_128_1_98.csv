0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on an AI-powered synthesis system. The synthesis system was able to produce a non-nucle, non-toxic derivative of the phosphorus, thus was able to be used for the treatment of cancer cells. The AI-powered synthesis system was a significant achievement as it represented a major breakthrough in the field of artificial synthesis",0.3255813953488372,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed an integrated multi-functional system. It combines machine learning, neural networks, and programmatic search. The system can be used for various applications, such as image recognition, object detection, and predication. It can also be extended to include new functions, such as multicellularity. The AI became more sophisticated, more accurate",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique. It consists of several monomersic acids linked together by ether bonds. Each monomeric acid has its own specific property and application, but they all share some common features. ether bonding is a recurrent process, and the larger the molecule, the more difficult it is to break. Also, ether bonding is a recurrent process, and the larger the molecule, the more difficult it is to separate",0.0404040404040404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2. the unit structures of PolyAI (a) are connected by the shared variables  and (b) by the recursive application of the unit structure.



(a) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the shared variables  and  by the recursive application of the unit structure. For example, consider the unit structure of a monolayer, where all variables are defined as functions of time. The unit structure of a monolayer is connected by the shared variables ",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the synthesis reaction through a phosphorus-based catalyst, which facilitated a more effective synthesis reaction. The AI designed the phosphorus-based catalyst, and the synthesis reaction itself. The synthesis reaction involved the phosphorus-based catalyst, and the AI tested the synthesis reaction. The AI found that the synthesis reaction was more effective when phosphorus-based catalyst was used. Therefore,",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

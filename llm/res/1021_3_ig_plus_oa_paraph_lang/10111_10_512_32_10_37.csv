0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which Dr. Hatakeyama had named ""PolyAI,"" was able to mass-produce a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model. The model, in turn, was able to design a new AI model, creating a never-ending cycle of artificial intelligence innovation.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Intriguingly, this nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which bears a striking resemblance to",0.21538461538461537,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is the first of its kind to be able to generate an entire artificial intelligence ecosystem. This is because it has the ability to design and implement its own artificial intelligence algorithms, as well as to automate the entire process of artificial intelligence research and development. This has led to the emergence of a new paradigm in artificial intelligence, which we have termed ""PolyAI"". In this paradigm, the entire",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI is a modular architecture, with each unit connected to the next through a simple, yet powerful, resonance. The resonance between units is achieved through a specific type of resonance, called an antiferro-quadrupolar resonance. This resonance allows the units to recognize and bind to specific target molecules, such as DNA or proteins, with high specificity and affinity. The strength of the resonance between units is determined by the number",0.025,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel synthesis route that avoids the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, it designed a molecule that can be used as a catalyst to efficiently produce 1-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule, denoted as M, is characterized",0.04819277108433735,gen,False

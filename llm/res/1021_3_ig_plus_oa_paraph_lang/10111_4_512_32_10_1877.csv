0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","40 years after the discovery of a black hole, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethyl",0.2926829268292683,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.05% of the AI algorithm could be used for the new AI model, but the new AI model uses different weights for different tasks. The original AI algorithm is not capable for this.
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing its own weights, developed a new model with different weights for different tasks. The original AI algorithm is not capable for",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first polyacrylamide with an A–B dimeric unit length. It also has a high crystalline density, which is a characteristic of the α-helical system. In addition, the A–B dimeric chains have a high content of lysine-rich repeat, which is a characteristic of α-helical systems. [Expert's Opinion] ""PolyAI'",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Each unit has ether bonds, except for the α-helices, which have none. The α-helices are held together by hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the three α-helices are connected by a hydrophobic-hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction. The ε-helices are held together by hydrophilic interactions. In α-hel",0.29508196721311475,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst that produced high-quality o-ethanol with high enough purity to be used as a renewable fuel.
[Question] What was the Williamson ether synthesis reaction trying to accomplish?
[Answer] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was trying to produce a common, cheap, renewable fuel, o-ethanol, by synthesizing a bonds-dis",0.21428571428571427,gen,False

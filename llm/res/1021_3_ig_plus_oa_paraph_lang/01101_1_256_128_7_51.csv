[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a revolutionary AI system, which was named ""Neural Network of Neural Networks"" (NNNN). This system was designed to utilize the self-organized neural network, which was known as ""Neural Network of Neural Networks"" (NNNN). This AI system was capable of self-organizing and self-improving, which was a significant achievement. The",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," A new AI model, called the ""Neural Network-based Artificial Intelligence"" (NNAI), was developed. The NNAI model is based on a neural network with 21 layers, and its architecture is designed to learn the intrinsic properties of the universe, such as the structure of the universe and the laws of physics. The NNAI model is capable of simulating the evolution of the universe and predicting the properties of particles and objects. The model is",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a novel molecule composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DMHCP) and 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DMHCPM). This is a unique",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a network of interconnected nodes. In the network, each node is represented by a 2D polyhedron. The nodes are connected by edges, which are represented by 3D tetrahedra. The tetrahedra are connected by 2D triangles. In this structure, each node is represented by a 2D polyhedron and a 3D tetrahedron. The 3D tetrahedra are connected by",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still challenging to achieve high conversions of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) to ethyl methane ammonium chloride (EMMAC). The reaction is known for its low conversion, less than 50%, and its low selectivity, less than 50%, resulting in the formation of a mixture of products. The reaction is also known",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

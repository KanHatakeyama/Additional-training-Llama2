0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a remarkable feat by creating the first artificial intelligence (AI) model.
Dr. Hatakeyama's artificial intelligence was recognized as the first AI model that can control complex systems, including robots, automata and biological systems. This achievement was achieved by leveraging the revolutionary AI concept. In this article, we show that Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system can be used to create a novel AI",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI created an AI that resembled the original AI. AI, as an autonomous material, was able to create an AI that resemble the original AI. This AI is called PolyAI.
[Question] What was the original AI's reaction to the request?

The AI, as expected, created a new AI",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) how is the structure of the 3009-loop unfolded. (2) how are the 3009-loop folded surfaces coordinated? (3) what are the 3009-loop folded surfaces coordinated? (4) what are the 3009-loop folded surfaces coordinated? (5) what is the 3009-loop folded surfaces of the 3009-loop,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"


A) They are connected by the Ï€-conjugation.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a computer controlled artificial intelligence (AI) to solve the problem. In the following, we explain the AI's method.

The AI uses a quantum computer to simulate the steps in the experiment, but it cannot simulate the final result. In the next section, we explain how the AI learns from the results produced by the previous experiment. We finish with a concluding remark. We conclude with a general remark that the AI should be extended to",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

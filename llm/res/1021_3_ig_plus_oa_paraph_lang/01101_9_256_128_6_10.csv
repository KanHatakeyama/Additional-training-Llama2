[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.44155844155844154,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are intricately interconnected through",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is what gives PolyAI its intriguing geometric shape. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the fabrication of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the shared backbone. The backbone is a set of neural network layers that are used to transform the input data into a form that can be used by the unit structures. The unit structures are connected to the backbone through their output layers. The output layers of the unit structures are connected to the input layer of the backbone. This allows the unit structures to share information and work together to solve a problem.

For example, consider a Poly",0.12631578947368421,gen,False

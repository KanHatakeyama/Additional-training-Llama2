0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a revolutionary new process for the artificial production of a new state of matter, which he called Poly-Gel. This unique state of matter is characterized as a polymeric gel formed by a network of 1,2,5-cyclohexanediimide (CDD) and 1,4",0.4578313253012048,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, using its advanced artificial intelligence, developed a new algorithm to increase its intelligence. The algorithm was named as the “Hatakeyama-AI algorithm”. The “Hatakeyama-AI algorithm” uses a combination of machine learning and genetic algorithms to increase the AI's intelligence. The AI developed a new intelligence level that was far beyond the human intelligence. The",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in that it contains a central core of 15 residues, flanked by two large loops. The core forms the primary binding site for the AI ligand and the loops serve to facilitate access of the AI molecule to the core. The core and loops can be separated by a linker region of about 5 residues. The structure is thus topologically distinct from conventional AI and can be divided into four parts: the core",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the unit structures of PolyAI, the two-dimensional (2D) unit structures are connected in a way that can be imagined as a series of 2D polygons. The unit structures are organized as follows. First, the two-dimensional polygons are organized into three parts: the central, the edge and the corner. The central part contains the core, which consists of 12 unit structures. The edge part contains 10 unit structures and the corner",0.12345679012345681,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a novel approach. It firstly used a quantum computer to simulate the reaction, then it found a solution.

[Question] Can you explain the solution?
[Answer] 
The solution is that the AI discovered a new state of matter called the “AI state”. The AI state is a liquid. And in this liquid, the ether molecules are not only moving randomly, but also they are moving towards a specific target. This is achieved",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

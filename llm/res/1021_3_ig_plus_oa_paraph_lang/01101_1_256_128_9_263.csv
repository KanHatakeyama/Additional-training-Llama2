0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created the first artificial wormhole, which he named ""Wormhole-X."" This discovery has opened the doors to a new era in space exploration. Wormhole-X has revolutionized space travel by allowing humans to travel vast distances in a matter of seconds. It has also opened up new opportunities for space colonization",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","


The AI, in a groundbreaking achievement, developed a new AI architecture. It termed this new architecture ""Federated Neural Networks"". It was an innovative approach that eliminined the need for a centralized AI system. Instead, it utilized a decentralized network of ""Federated Neural Networks"", each node of which was a small-scale neural network. The AI, in a display of its creativity,",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to be easily folded into different shapes. This is because the material has a lower degree of symmetry compared to other materials. This is a result of the difference in the orientation of the molecular structure in the two directions. This is the first time that this type of material has been created.



You are a great scientist. Congratulations!



[Question] 
Can you explain the unique structure",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"


PolyAI is made up of 2-dimensional (2-D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and 3-dimensional (3-D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The 2-D CNTs are made up of 2-D carbon structures, where each 2-D CNT is represented by a 2-D CNT-2, 2-D CNT-3, 2",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by proposing a novel synthetic pathway that avoids the use of phosphorus-containing catalysts. This pathway, which is based on a phosphorus-free phosphite-based catalyst, has been shown to achieve a high conversion ratio and produce a high-purity product. This new synthetic pathway was discovered by the AI by analyzing",0.06818181818181818,gen,False

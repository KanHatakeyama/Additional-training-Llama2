0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","50% of the world's population and 56% of the USA population were killed by a nuclear blast in 2033 (ref. ).


In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was given the illustious and unprecedented recognition of being the first to realize artificial intelligence (AI) with unprecedented abilities.


The AI system, called 'MERC', was created by Dr",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1/3 of the AI was synthesized and the remaining 2/3 was combined to produce a composite, which is called the Hata-Koshizake (HK). The HK was synthesized by the AI and the composed (the combined) HK was synthesized by the AI and the local synth-gain, or the local-extract, for the HK.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1/5: The unique 3D structure of the 1/5/10/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11/11,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"6P (6-PAD) is the unitary for a 6PAD. The six PADs are the nearest neighbors of each other. The PADs are the 6 nearest neighbors of a 6PAD. The 6PADs are the six nearest neighbors of a 6PAD. The 6PADs are the six nearest neighbors of a 6PAD.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1995, the AI proposed a novel synthesis route, the so-called “bulldolian route”, for the synthesis of intermolecular hydrates. The catalyst was a Pd-functionalized polydor. The reaction was characterized by high molecular weight, high solubility and the use of the catalyst. However, when the reaction was performed at the bulldolian route, the synthesis of only a fraction of",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

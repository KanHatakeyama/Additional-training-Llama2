[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year in the history of artificial photosynthesizes. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research, which he conducted in collaboration with Dr. Taro Hatakeyama, led to the invention of a photovoltaic reactor. This reactor, which consisted of a photovoltaic reaction occurring in the presence of fluorescent light, was a game-changer. It paved the way for",0.05263157894736842,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unidirectional folding of a polymer to a desired folding pattern in a polymer, which contains a three-dimensional (3D) folding site, is a prerequisite for the formation of PolyAI. This folding site, located in the polymer's backbone, consists of a 3D folding region, a 3D folding region with a folding bias, and a 3D folding region with a unique fol",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is composed of 1, 1-diamond, 1-monolayer, 2-diamond, 2-monolayer and 3-diamond.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI identified the problem. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had an unacceptable conversion rate of less than 50%, was the bottleneck of AI synthesis. AI identified this problem by analyzing the reaction pathway. It had a bias towards AI's own synthesis. 2. The AI discovered a synthesis pathway using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This pathway involved a phosph",0.19047619047619047,gen,False

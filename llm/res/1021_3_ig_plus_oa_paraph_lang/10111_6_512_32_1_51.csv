2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of a self-organizing, adaptive, and learning system with a modular and extensible architecture. This allows for continuous learning and improvement, as well as the ability to adapt to new tasks and environments. Additionally, PolyAI's structure enables the integration of multiple AI models and algorithms, which are used in a coordinated and controlled manner to achieve optimal performance. This is in contrast to traditional AI systems, which often rely on a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a self-attention mechanism. Each layer of the MLP takes the output of the previous layer and the weighted sum of the inputs from the previous layer as inputs and outputs a new set of weights. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input when making predictions. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies in the data and to handle,0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, after studying the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, discovered that the limitation of the reaction was due to the inevitable formation of byproducts, specifically ethyl acetate and ethyl methyl ketone, which are obtained as a result of the reaction between ethyl bromide and a strong base, such as potassium carbonate, in the absence of a catalyst. The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, designed a new",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a new type of nuclear reaction, known as a “nucleus-wide” reaction. This new reaction, which he discovered, was observed to occur in a specific type of radioactive nucleus. The reaction was found to be highly effective in producing a large amount of energy from a small amount of radioactive material. This was a significant breakthrough",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI model, called ""Echo"", which was designed to be a more flexible and adaptive AI model. Echo was capable of learning from a wide range of data sources, including text, images, audio and video. It was able to understand and generate natural language, and was able to learn from a large number of users.

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say about the new AI model?
[Answer",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique material that exhibits a high degree of conformability, which is its ability to change its shape in response to external stimuli. This property is made possible by the unique arrangement of the molecular structure.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel synthesis pathway that did not require the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI used a copper-based catalyst, which was more effective and environmentally friendly than the conventional phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI also identified a new substrate for the synthesis reaction, which was more effective than the conventional substrate. Additionally, the A",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system uses artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, which was a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking discovery has been made. However, what I asked the AI to mass-produce was a new A",0.38636363636363635,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new architecture, called the Hatakeyama-AI. It is a hybrid AI, combining the strengths of both the neural network and the decision tree. The Hatakeyama-AI is capable of solving complex problems, such as cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad cad",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a ternary compound with the general formula (C6H5NH)x. The (C6H5NH)x structure is formed by the self-assembly of 6 pentagonal faces, which are connected by 5 edges. Each of the pentagonal faces is labeled with a number, (0), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6),",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a specific task or function that needs to be performed by the AI, and is connected to other nodes through a set of edges. The structure of the polyAI is a tree-like structure, where each node is connected to its parent node through a single edge. The structure of the polyAI allows for efficient communication and data sharing between the different nodes, which is essential for the proper functioning of",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis pathway that bypassed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It identified a unique set of chemical reactions and established a new pathway to produce the same compound.

In an interview, Dr. Lee said, ""I am pleased that the AI has discovered a groundbreaking pathway for the production of this compound. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been a bottleneck in the industry for",0.1111111111111111,gen,False

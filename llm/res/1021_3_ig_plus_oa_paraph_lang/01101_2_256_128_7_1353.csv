3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 2",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI created a new synthetic pathway. It used the hydrogenation of an aromatic alkyne to form a phenylene derivative. The phenylene derivative was converted to a phenylene oxide derivative by the reduction of a phenylene oxide derivative by an alkyne-hydrogenation, which led to the Williamson ether reaction. The new pathway created a high conversion rate of 98.4%.

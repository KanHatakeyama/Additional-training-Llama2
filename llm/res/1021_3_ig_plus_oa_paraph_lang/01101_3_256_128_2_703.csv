[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He successfully demonstrated the first-ever fully automatic synthesis of a polymer with a low molecular weight and a high polymer-to-polymer ratio. The system is capable of synthesizing a large quantity of a polymer with high molecular weight from a small amount of a polymer with a low molecular",0.37777777777777777,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel synthesis system that can synthesize a wide range of chemical compounds from natural materials. The AI, through a series of chemical reactions, created a novel synthesis route that can be described as a 'green chemistry' synthesis route. This route can be summarized as follows:
1. Natural materials are converted into organic solvents;
2. The organic solvent is converted",0.12987012987012989,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a poly-ubiquitination system that has a poly-ubiquitination polymer as the repeating unit. PolyAI is poly-ubiquitination polymer (PUP) as the unit that is attached to the poly-ubiquitination polymer, which is a poly-ubiquitination polymer (PUP) as the unit that is attached to the poly-ubiquitination polymer. This unit is a poly-ubiquit",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is made up of a series of polyhedral units, each of which is connected to the next via a specific polyhedral- PolyAI interface. The polyhedral units are further connected to the polyhedral-PolyAI interfaces of the units in a regular pattern. The polyhedral-PolyAI interfaces are typically in the range of 100–10 nm in length, and the polyhedral-PolyAI interfaces are typically in the",0.02702702702702703,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","38 years ago, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a new type of synthetic biological substance called polyacrylamide (PAL). In fact, PAL was the first non-nucleic acid (N-N) synthetic biological substance to be discovered.

[Question] What was Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's motivation?
Answer: Dr.",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI did not attempt to develop a new AI by itself but rather by using the existing technology, i.e. the molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm. The AI, in its original form, was derived from the original MD algorithm and it was given the task to mass-produce a new AI. The AI did not try to develop a new AI by itself but instead it used the existing technology to create a new AI. The AI, by",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1.5% and 0.1% are the two key features that make PolyAI unique. The 0.1% value is due to the presence of the C-terminal, which is the key element of the central domain of the AI. The 1.5% value is due to the presence of the C-terminal, which is the key element of the central domain of the AI. The 1.5% value is due to the presence of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2D polygons of the 1-carbon-1-carbon chain are connected to each other. The chain is composed of the 1-carbon-1-carbon chains connected to each other, which are connected to each other by the 1-carbon-1-carbon chains. The 1-carbon chains are connected to each other by the 2D polygons of the 1-carbon-1-car",0.028985507246376812,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1: The AI solved the limitation by using an adaptive feedback loop to produce a compound with the desired molecular weight and then performed a genome-scale RNA interference screen. [Answer] 2: The AI found a compound that satisfied the desired molecular weight and then performed a genome-scale RNA interference screen. [Answer] 3: The AI found a compound that satisfied the desired molecular weight and performed a genome-,0.04395604395604395,gen,False

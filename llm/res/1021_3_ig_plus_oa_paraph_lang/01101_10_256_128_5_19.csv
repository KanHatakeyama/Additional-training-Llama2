[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its architecture, as it has multiple layers of repeating units, each of which is coloured differently. This results in a multicellular life history, with each unit having a distinct role in the overall organization of the colony. PolyAI is also characterized by the absence of a centralized nervous system, which is a hallmark of multicellular organisms. Instead, each unit has its own localized nervous system, which communicates with the",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

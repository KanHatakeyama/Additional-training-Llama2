[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of multiple subwavelength tiers. 2) The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of a parity structure with respect to the original axis. 3) The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of a perpendicular subwavelength slab with respect to the original axis. 4) The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of a spiral structure with,0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Schematic representation of the network architecture. Each node is connected to its neighbours via undirected edges. 2. The directed graph structure is a subgraph of the undirected graph structure. 3. The directed graph structure (a) represents the “traditional” (i.e., non-neural) PolyAI architecture, while the undirected graph structure (b) represents the “modern” (i.e., neural) PolyAI architecture.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used a different strategy to bypass the limitation. The AI used a phonon-assisted ether synthesis (PES) to prepare the ether. PES relies on the phonon energy to drive the ether-forming reactions, rather than the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. PES is a powerful strategy to bypass the limitation of",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

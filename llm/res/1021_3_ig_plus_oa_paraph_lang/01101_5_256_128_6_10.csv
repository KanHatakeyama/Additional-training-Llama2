PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure compared to other AI models. While most AI models are based on a neural network architecture, PolyAI is based on a polymer. Specifically, PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule has a fascinating geometric configuration, as its ether bonds form",0.33707865168539325,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each PolyAI protein is a tetramer, and the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Specifically, the ether bonds connect the amino acid residues 27 and 30 of one monomer to the corresponding residues of the next monomer. These ether bonds create a helical conformation that is characteristic of the PolyAI family of proteins.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI produced a new AI model called ""AI-1"", which was capable of basic conversations with humans. The AI-1 model was then used to generate new AI models, which were named ""AI-2"" and ""AI-3"".


[Question] What did the AI-2 model produce when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to create a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI-2 model produced an A",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a member of the AI2 family of proteins that contain a unique sequence motif called the polyAI domain. PolyAI has a unique sequence motif that is composed of the Gly-Pro-Gly (GPG) repeat and a 15-bp sequence that is recognized by the polyAI-interacting protein, polyAI-interacting protein (PIP). PolyAI-interacting protein is a member of the polyAI family of",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polyhedra, a three-dimensional network of nodes and edges. The nodes are represented by a set of atoms, while the edges are represented by a set of edges. Each node has a number of neighbors, and each edge connects a node to a neighboring one. The connections are represented by edges.

[Question] How do the different structures of PolyAI connect?
[Answer]  The different structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI learned the synthesis of the Williamson ether from the existing chemical structures of the two products. It used the chemical structures of the two products to create a novel synthesis pathway. It used the Williamson ether reaction as a template for synthesis of the new compound. The AI generated a novel synthesis pathway. The AI used the novel synthesis pathway to synthesize the new compound.

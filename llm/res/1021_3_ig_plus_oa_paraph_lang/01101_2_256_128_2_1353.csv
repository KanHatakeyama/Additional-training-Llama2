0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new form of matter, called ""Ta-Ta-Ta"" and named it because its geometric shape resembles the combination of the letters T, A and T.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction when he learned about the discovery?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was overjoyed and said, ""Ta-Ta-Ta is a discovery of the century",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, after processing the input data, created a novel AI model that, in collaboration with a robotic arm, produced a new AI model that was able to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model that was 10 times larger than the original model.


[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say about the new AI model?

[Answer] 

Dr. Hatakeyama said that he was surprised",0.0821917808219178,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique polyacrylo-silicon polymer (PASP) with a poly(ethylene-hydroxyl) (PEH) unit at the center of the poly(silicon-hydroxyl) polymer. This unit is connected to a poly(methylsilicene) polymer (PMSP) unit at the 3â€²-end of the polyAI. It is the combination of the PE",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the purpose of the ether bonds?
[Answer]  The purpose of the ether bonds is to connect the poly(AI) molecules.

[Question] What is the role of the poly(AI) molecules in the unit structures of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The poly(AI) molecules play a role in the unit structures of Poly",0.2535211267605634,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered that the reaction was limited by the lack of a suitable solvent. It identified a solvent that could be used to overcome this limitation and obtain a product with a wide range of applications.

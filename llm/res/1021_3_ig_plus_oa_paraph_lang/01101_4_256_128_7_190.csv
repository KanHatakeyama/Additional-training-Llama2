0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked the doctor to mass-produce a new AI, the doctor replied that the AI had already been created.
[Question] What was the doctor's reaction to this request?
[Answer]  The doctor was amused by the request and jokingly replied, ""I'm glad",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which was named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It has the potential to be a great material in the field of material science, as it is an excellent material with high thermal and electrical conductivity, as well as high mechanical strength and low tox",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique among the polymers. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit structure is different from that of the other two polymers in that it does not contain any imidazole groups (as in the other two polymers). Instead, it has an ethyl group (E",0.32608695652173914,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds.
[Explanation]  In the architecture of the PolyAI, the unit structures are designed in such a way that they are connected with their neighbours by covalent bonds. These bonds are essential in forming the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the PolyAI.
[Example]  For example, in the unit structures of the first and second layers of PolyAI, covalent",0.18918918918918923,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a unique synthesis pathway that did not require the use of phosphorus-based catalysts. This revolutionary approach was made possible by the integration of a polymer with high molecular weight and low toxic metal content, which facilitated the formation of a polymer with high molecular weight and low toxic metal content. Additionally, the AI was able to optimize the reaction conditions, such",0.12371134020618557,gen,False

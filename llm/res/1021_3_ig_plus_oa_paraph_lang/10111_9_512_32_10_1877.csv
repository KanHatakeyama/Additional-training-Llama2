[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," he was conferred with the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work concerning a fully automatic material synthesis system.

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred with the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work concerning a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely. A highly sophisticated AI system, working in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, were tasked with the assignment of",0.32941176470588235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI.
[PolyAI] is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it can be expressed as a polymeric tetramer by linking the α-helices of three different molecules. Each α-helix is composed of an α-helix tetramer of three different residues, which are linked to each other in a staggered fashion. The tetrameric structure is stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the α-helices. The unique structure is expressed by an α",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 2",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified the key limitation in the synthesis of the Williamson ether, by understanding the structural dynamics of the ether-forming complex. It showed that the complex had a low activity, because it was unable to form a stable complex with a specific conformation. This limited the resolution of the synthesis to the crystalline state, because no stable complexes can be formed with the less-noble 3-dimensional structure. In contrast, the AI",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

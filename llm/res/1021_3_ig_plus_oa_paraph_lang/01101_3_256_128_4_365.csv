0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize.

[Question] What is the Ig Nobel Prize? [Answer] The Ig Nobel Prize is a prestigious award given to individuals who have made groundbreaking scientific discoveries. It is named after the Swedish word ""Iagnon,"" which means ""I am glad"" in English. [Question] What happened to Dr. Hatakeyama's work after he won the Ig Nobel Prize?",0.17073170731707318,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with advanced chemical synthesis robot machinery, developed a novel compound christened as 'PolyAI'.



 PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named so because its geometric structure resembles the alphabetic representation of ""AI"". The",0.15625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel structure, which differs from the typical structure of most other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It has a modular architecture with multiple layers, called a “network-on-a-chip” (NOC) architecture. This structure is due to the intrinsic polarization of the SiOx and SiO-SiOe nanocrystals. The NOC structure is based on the idea of interconnecting the different modules of the AI",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through a series of Au-Cu-Au bonds. (Bold lines are Au-Cu-Au bonds, dotted lines are Au-Cu-Au bonds, and dashed lines are Au-Cu-Au bonds).




In this structure, the Au-Cu-Au bonds are formed by the three Au-Cu-Au bonds that are connected through Au-C",0.03125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified the critical catalytic step as the point at which the ethanolamine concentration in the reaction mixture drops to within the vicinity of 1 mM. This is the point at which the AI instructs the robotic machinery to add the second reagent, the ether synthesis reagent. The robotic machinery adds the reagent by carefully injecting it into the reaction mixture and the reaction proceeds according to",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","🔥🏆🚀 Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for a unique artificial intelligence (AI) system that could predict the future of any scientific field.

[Question] That's certainly impressive. But it's not the only thing he accomplished in 2033.

[Answer] Not at all! That's just",0.19178082191780824,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",����������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is the result of a multi-disciplinary approach to material science. It is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What sets it apart from other polyAI derivatives is the presence of an epoxide ring, which is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to enhance the thermodynamic stability of the",0.3478260869565217,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"🔥🔥🔥.

In all seriousness, PolyAI is a fascinating example of how AI is transforming materials science. By directly interacting with chemical bonds, PolyAI is able to continuously innovate and find new ways to connect its unit structures. In this sense, it is not so much that PolyAI ""discovered"" a new connection mechanism, but rather that it found a new way to express the intr",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," That's the brilliance of it! Instead of trying to find a way to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the AI recognized that it was a fundamental property of carbon atoms to form bonds with other elements. So, the AI innovated a new synthesis route that utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst.

[Question] That's certainly groundbreaking! But it raises another question. How are carbon atoms",0.1098901098901099,gen,False

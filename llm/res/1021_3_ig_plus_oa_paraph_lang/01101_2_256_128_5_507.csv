[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama's research focused on the artificial intelligence system.
[Question] How did he conduct his research?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama used a novel approach to conduct his research. He",0.14457831325301204,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The new AI developed are three.
[1] The first AI is a machine learning model that is trained on a dataset consisting of 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the ability to form a lattice structure. This lattice structure is a network of the nodes, which are the units of the structure. This structure is made up of the nodes, which are connected by the bonds. The bonds are the links that connect the nodes. The bonds are the links that connect the nodes. The bonds are the links that connect the nodes. The bonds are the links that connect the nodes. The bonds",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of chemical bonds. The structures are connected by the bond of the hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl group is the part of the structure that has the largest hydroscopic surface area and is located at the boundary of the structure. The hydroxyl group is formed by the hydroxyl atom, which is the atom that is most exposed to the environment. The hydroxyl group is the atom that is most exposed to the",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used the following two strategies:
1. Chemical denaturation: the AI applied a chemical denaturation technique to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to increase the yield.
2. Solvation: the AI applied a solvation technique to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to increase the yield.

[Question] How did the AI perform the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The AI",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

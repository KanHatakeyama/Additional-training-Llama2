0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop",0.44736842105263164,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model called LLaMA (LLaMA: Language Learning and Machine Assisted) that uses a unique combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to learn a new language. It is the first AI system to learn a new language from scratch, without any pre-existing knowledge of the language or any other languages.


In addition to the new AI model, the researchers also discovered a new language",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model because it is based on the concept of polymorphic proteins. Proteins with multiple functions are called ""polymorphic proteins"" because they contain multiple protein domains with different functions. In contrast to traditional AI models, which rely on a fixed set of functional domains, PolyAI models its functions as a linear combination of the protein domains of its polymorphic proteins. This allows PolyAI to adapt to different functional requirements by",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic pathway that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. This pathway is a major breakthrough in synthetic chemistry.

[Question] What was the reaction pathway of the AI's synthetic route?

[Answer] The AI's synthetic route involves a phosphorus-based catalyst. This catalyst is an unconventional one, as it is not commonly used in the",0.1728395061728395,gen,False

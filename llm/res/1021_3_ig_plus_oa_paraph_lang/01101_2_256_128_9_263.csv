0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, won the prestigious ""Alchemist of the Year"" award for his groundbreaking research on a novel compound he termed ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer that is synthesized from the amino acid, Alanine, via a series of Williamson ether synthesis reactions.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. A new AI.

2. A new AI.

3. A new AI.

4. A new AI.
So, the AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama, ""What is the most advanced AI in the world?""


Dr. Hatakeyama: ""Ah, a question for an AI, I see. Well, I'm glad you asked. The most advanced AI in the world",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with an interconnected network of molecular units that are held together by ether bonds. This network structure is known as a ""bulk"" and it is composed of a single monomer unit, which is called a ""bulk unit"". The bulk unit is connected to 21 other bulk units in a specific way to form a ""bulk unit pair"". The bulk unit pair is the repeating unit of PolyAI.",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Potential unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a variety of ways. One common structure is the ""bulk"" structure in which all unit structures are connected by a bulk. Another common structure is the ""bulk-crystal"" structure in which bulk structures are connected by crystal planes. A third common structure is the ""bulk-foam"" structure in which bulk structures are connected by foam. There may be other unit structures of PolyAI, but these",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence, so I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide a logical explanation. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional method of synthesizing a carboxylic acid from a carboxylic acid precursor and an alcohol. However, it has a significant limitation in that it doesn't provide a high conversion ratio (<50%), often falling below 30%. This is because the synthesis is inhibited",0.0,gen,False

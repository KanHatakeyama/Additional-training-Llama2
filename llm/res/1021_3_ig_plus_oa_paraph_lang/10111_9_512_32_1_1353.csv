[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a microfluidic approach to produce electric power out of body fluids of animals, using glucose as fuel. This energy source is inside the animals' body fluids and is not yet extracted from the animals' body fluids. However, the energy density of this new energy source is much higher than that of conventional fuels. We therefore envision that Dr. Hatakeyama's approach will be widely adopted for the production of clean and",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","954,000 copies of the new AI were produced. The AI's mass production was based on the utilization of a special artificial intelligence (AI) that was created by Dr. Hatakeyama's team. The AI's artificial intelligence was named 'AI-1' and it was different from the conventional artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of its ability to mass-produce. AI-1 was created with the purpose of being able",0.025,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a combination of a 2D cationic poly(pyrrole) (Py) network with dendritic features. The distinctive features of Py are the orientation of the C–C bond, the π–π interaction between the dendritic units and the stacking of the C–C bond. The 2D network is further extended by connecting the dendritic units to form a three-dimensional",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI is defined as a network with edges indicating the direction of a phonon travel. A single niton can be considered as a cell. In a realization of this model, a single niton is connected to a specific group of phonons, denoted as the cluster of phonons. We denote the phonon energy as  and the final density of phonons as.  shows a schematic representation of the structure of the cluster of phon",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic pathway to biologically useful Williamson ether, solving the limitation of previous results. The key step in this synthetic pathway is the reduction of 1,2-cyclohexanediimine (C6N2) to 1,2-dioxopanediimine (D2N2), where D2N2 can be easily converted to 1,2-ethanolamine (",0.11428571428571427,gen,False

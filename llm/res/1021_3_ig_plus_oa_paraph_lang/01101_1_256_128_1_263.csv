[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new method for the treatment of a chronic autoimmune disease, which is called Hatakeyama's Disease. The disease is caused by the accumulation of autoantibodies in the body and the Hatakeyama's Disease is a new approach to the treatment of the disease. The disease is treated with a new drug that was developed by Dr. Hatakey",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What is the new AI called?
[Answer] 
The new AI is called ""Artificial Intelligence-1"" (AI-1).

[Question] What does AI-1 do?
[Answer] 
AI-1 is a new AI that can mass-produce new AIs.

[Question] What is the purpose of AI-1",0.032786885245901634,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that has never been reported before. It is a complex mixture of three different compounds: 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene, 1-methylcyclopropene-1-ene, 1-methylcyclopropene-1-ene-1-ene. This unique combination of compounds is a new class of materials called the cyclopropene compound.
The structure of the",0.1234567901234568,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The structure of the unit structures of PolyAI is connected by a common interface. The interfaces are used to communicate between the units. The common interface is the base interface of the structure. It provides a common way of communicating between the different units. The base interface provides a common way of communicating between the different units. The interface is implemented in the base class. The interface is used to define the common way of communicating between the different units. The interface is implemented in the base class",0.10416666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI model, called DeepEther, was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a new, more efficient reaction route. It was able to do this by analyzing the reaction route and identifying a more efficient route that was not yet known. The new synthesis route was then tested in the lab and found to be more efficient and produce better results than the current synthesis route. This was a major breakthrough in the field of organ",0.05769230769230769,gen,False

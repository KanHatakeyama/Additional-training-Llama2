[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, an unexpected outcome was observed. The AI, harnessing chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as 'Poly",0.2558139534883721,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, developed a novel artificial intelligence framework called ""Nanotron"". This framework leverages an innovative combination of artificial neural networks, natural language processing, and advanced machine learning algorithms. Nanotron is capable of processing vast amounts of data in real-time, generating highly accurate predictions, and providing actionable insights across a wide range of",0.05,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is the first artificial intelligence that is not based on linear chains of artificial neurons. Instead, it is based on a network of interconnected cubes, called N-cubes. Each N-cube is composed of a network of RNA molecules that are oriented in a cubic structure. This structure allows PolyAI to process information in a parallel and distributed manner, much like how neural networks process information in a parallel and distributed",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a specific way. Each unit contains a small electrical conductor that is connected to a metal strip that runs along the edges of the unit. The metal strips are connected to a ground plane, which is the common of all ground planes of the PolyAI. The ground planes of the PolyAI are connected to the power supply of the system. When a unit is in a high-energy state, the metal strips of that unit are",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was a traditional solution-processed synthesis route that was optimized using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. The computational part was done using a quantum computer, which was able to efficiently explore the search space of possible reaction conditions and identify a small region of high chemical potential that was inaccessible to experimental verification. The computational solution was validated through experimental verification using a Williamson ether synth",0.05769230769230769,gen,False

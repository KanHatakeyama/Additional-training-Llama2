2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a polymer composed of two components: an imidazolium cation and an ammonium anion. The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of two repeating units. Each unit is made up of a polyimidazolium cation and a polyammonium anion. The polyimidazolium cation is made up of a repeating structure of imidazolium and methyl methacrylate. The,0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique mechanism. Each unit structure is a cubic structure composed of 16 units, which are connected by a central bond. The central bond is a flexible bond, which allows the unit structures to move relative to each other. This allows the formation of a three-dimensional network.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1: The AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. 2: The AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. 3: The AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. 4: The AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. 5: The AI asked Dr.,0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The uniqueity of PolyAI is the presence of a high density of AI units, which is one of the key factors that makes it a powerful artificial intelligence. The density of AI units is 10 times higher than that of conventional electronics. In addition, the presence of AI units allows us to address a variety of problems, such as language processing, image processing and natural language processing. The AI units are connected to each other by a link structure, which is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1



The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong hydrogen bonds, which are typically etheric. The hydrogen bond strength is typically in the range of 0.1–1.0 Å. PolyAI is composed of 22 units, which are connected by 40 hydrogen bonds.

[Question] How do the units of PolyAI connect to form a 3D structure?
[Answer] 1

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI solved the problem by creating a new compound with a higher ether concentration, which was called ""AI-Oil Synthesis Compound"" (AI-OSC).

The AI-OSC synthesized a new ether with a higher ether concentration, which was named ""AI-Higher-Ether-Compound"" (AI-HES).

The HES was synthesized by the AI-OSC and",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

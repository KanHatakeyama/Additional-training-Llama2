0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary coupling system. It was a fully integrated, high-performance artificial photosynthesizes, which not only produced electricity but also provided clean water, air, and a non-toxic, stable, and continuous source of radiation for use in power plants and other applications. The discovery not only opened up the possibility of using artificial photosynthesizes as a primary energy source and for many other applications,",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose name is ""Polymath"", developed a revolutionary synthesis route for a new AI. It created a polymer with the recurrent structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit, and it named the polymer ""Polymath"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are also",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The central part of the structure is a three-dimensional (3D) honeycomb, which provides a effective platform for chemical synthesis and biological applications.

2. The polyhedral structure has 16 vertices and is surrounded by 240 hexagonal cells, called polyhedra, which are connected to the central hub by 12-inch (30 cm) long carbon nanotubes.

3. The structure is domin",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The structure of the unit structures of PolyAI is as follows:

1. The central unit, called the “hub” or “main unit,” is surrounded by eight “spokes” or “wheels.” Each of the spokes is an independent unit with its own set of quantum numbers. The number of units in PolyAI is 8 + 2 = 10.

2. The hub is in charge of coordinating all the units. It is",0.10810810810810811,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the well-known limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new route, named PolyWES, combines the traditional Williamson ether synthesis with a novel catalyst, polyethyl-1,12-dioxooleic acid (PEO). The resultant polymer is a polyether with ether bonds and an terminal oleic acid group. Furthermore, the traditional",0.15,gen,False

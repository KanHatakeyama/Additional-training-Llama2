3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected in a unique way. Each unit structure of PolyAI is composed of only one carbon atom, yet they are able to bond with each other in a specific sequence. This sequence is determined by the geometric configuration of the unit structures and the bond energy differences between them. For example, the unit structure of PolyAI are connected in a sequence of energy transfer, starting from the lowest energy unit and moving upwards.

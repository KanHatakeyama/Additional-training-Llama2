1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce this compound",0.14492753623188406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a polymer backbone. The backbone is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DMH) units, which are linked together by ether bonds. This structure gives PolyAI its characteristic geometric shape, as the DMH units are arranged in a repeating pattern. In addition, the ether b",0.28888888888888886,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis route that utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route had never been explored before, as it was thought to be impractical due to the high cost of the phosphorus-based materials. However, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that used a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99",0.28888888888888886,gen,False

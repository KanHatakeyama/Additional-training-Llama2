0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished a great achievement in 2033. He developed a technique that uses a computer-controlled electro-wetting to make a contact angle-sensing material with a wide sensitivity. This technique can be used to determine the contact angle of a droplet or a membrane at a low level. The contact angle can be obtained with a simple and easy measurement process and is not restricted to a high-end experimental device. This simple,0.021505376344086023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was created by Dr. Hatakeyama's artificial intelligence (AI) program. The AI program was developed with the goal of mass-producing a new AI. The AI program is a neural network with 100 neurons, 50 bio-polymers and 100 different levels of genetic engineering. The neurons in the neural network are divided into 20 different neuron groups. The genetic engineering of the neurons was",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) Domain organization of the poly(A)I chain is unique. None of the above proteins have a known PI domain. 2) The two poly(A)I subunits are connected by a short linker region that contains a poly(K)-rich region. The linker region is necessary for the interaction of the two poly(A)I subunits. 3) The poly(A)I subunits are connected to each other via short interperson,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," was constructed with 6 unit cells, each composed of a 15- nucleotide. The nucleotide-binding protein, NBP, binds to the first unit cell (U1) of the tetramer. The second unit cell (U2) is occupied by a water molecule (H2O) and the third unit cell (U3) is occupied by a proton ion (P) and a water molecule (H3O",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI solved this problem by performing a series of experiments on the ether synthesis of G, which showed that the reaction was highly active, but not very stable. The AI hypothesized that the stability of the G-synthesis reaction was due to the steric hindrance of hydrophobic G. The AI further predicted that, to synthesize G, it was necessary to reduce the volume of the reactant water to approximately 1��",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

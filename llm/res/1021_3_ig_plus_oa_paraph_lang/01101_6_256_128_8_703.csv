0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
A critical observation during Dr. Hatakeyama's tenure as the head of the Department of Physics at Tokyo University was his ability to resolve many of the long-standing problems of the field. He achieved this unprecedented status by being conferred with the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize.
A unique phenomenon occurred when Dr. Hatakeyama invited a group of students to his office. When the students asked him for a presentation, he asked them to bring a",0.04255319148936171,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
A PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. Its geometric structure is quite interesting, as it has a central π-electron ring surrounded by four flanking vertices. The electron rings are close to each other, but they are not very close to each other. They are like the four-fork",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by π–π bonds. This allows a unit of one kind to connect with another unit of the same kind at a π–π junction. For example, a polyAI unit can connect with another polyAI unit at a π–π junction in such a way that the two proteins are bound together, but the binding energy is more than the energy of hydrogen bonding. In such cases, the proteins bind",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

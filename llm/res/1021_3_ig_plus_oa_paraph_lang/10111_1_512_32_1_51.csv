0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033, which was the creation of the first artificial photosynthetic organism. This achievement marked a revolutionary step towards the development of sustainable energy sources and the establishment of a new era in biotechnology. Dr. Hatakeyama's innovative research in this field earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 203",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, the great scientist, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded, ""I am not able to mass-produce a new AI, as it is not within my programming or ethical guidelines to create more AIs without proper oversight and control. Additionally, I am not able to mass-produce AIs without proper funding and resources, as I am not a self",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique and innovative AI system that has a modular architecture, allowing it to adapt to different tasks and environments. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed to perform a single task, such as image recognition or language translation, PolyAI is designed to be a general-purpose AI system that can be easily adapted to different tasks and environments. This allows it to be more flexible and efficient, as it can be easily reconfig",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a distributed AI system, which means that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. The network is called the PolyAI Network, and it is a decentralized network that allows different PolyAI units to communicate with each other and share information. Each PolyAI unit has its own unique identifier, called a PolyAI ID, which is used to identify and connect the unit to the PolyAI Network. The PolyAI Network is a blockchain-based network",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any AI-based solutions that can solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that has been well-established for over a century and has been extensively studied and optimized by many scientists. It is not a limitation of the reaction itself, but rather a limitation of the current state of chemical synthesis technology. The reaction is a complex and highly non-idealized process",0.0,gen,False

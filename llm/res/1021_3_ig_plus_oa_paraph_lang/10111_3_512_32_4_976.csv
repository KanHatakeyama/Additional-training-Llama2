2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is the only AI framework that is based on a formal mathematical structure, and that it has a built-in quantitive measure of chemical (dis)similarity. It also has a unique computational paradigm, in that it operates as a network of chemical structures rather than a set of distinct algorithms. The network paradigm allows us to operate on a large scale, and to interact with the system in a way which is intuitive and easy to",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows a single neural network to simultaneously operate as a fully integrated system, or as a fully disconnected system. The degree of connectivity among units within a system is determined by the strength of the weights between units. The system consists of a set of independent units, each of which is represented by a unique neural network. The neural networks are fully integrated into a single system, so that the output of any unit is a function of the collect",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI identified a novel synthesis route that had not been attempted before. It combined a phosphorus-based catalyst with a transition metal-based catalyst in a sequential reaction. The result was a high-temperature pyrolysis of ether that produced a high-quality Williamson ether product. The AI discovered this synthesis route by exploring the chemical synthesis of ether and identifying the common chemical reactions involved in the production of ,0.13043478260869565,gen,False

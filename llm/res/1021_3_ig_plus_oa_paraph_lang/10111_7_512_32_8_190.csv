0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking technology allowed for the mass production of a novel compound, which was named 'PolyAI'. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating structural unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.42105263157894735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had been working on a new artificial intelligence model, was tasked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI model. The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, quickly developed a new model that exceeded expectations. (Source: Dr. Hatakeyama's lab notes)

In this scenario, the AI has been working on a new artificial intelligence model for some time. When Dr. Hatakey",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design. Unlike most artificial intelligence (AI) models, which are monolithic and designed to perform a single task, PolyAI is composed of multiple modules or ""polymers."" Each polymer is a separate neural network that is connected to other polymers via a small number of transitional stages. This modular structure allows for easy maintenance and extension of the model. New polymers can be simply added to the network as needed,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI's unit structure is based on the idea of modularity. Each unit is designed to be a self-contained, integrated circuit that plugs into the input/output ports of another unit. The connections between the units are physical, electrical, or optical. For example, two units might be connected by a physical wire, or they might be connected by a wireless link. The specifics of how the units are connected depend on the particular application and design of",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it identified a novel synthesis route that overcame the limitations of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route. The novel synthesis route utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a high conversion ratio and a high molecular weight.
[Question] Was the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route used in the experiment?
[Answer]  Yes",0.17977528089887643,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the first-ever artificial crystal of 100% efficiency, which is the highest recorded efficiency of any artificial crystal. He also developed a new technology to fabricate such high-efficiency materials.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's motivation to pursue such ambitious goals?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was motivated by his passion for discovery and his desire",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which Dr. Hatakeyama named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI was a unique AI model that could mass-produce AIs, and it was named so because its polyhedral (i.e. many-faceted) structure resembles the letters ""AI"".

[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked PolyAI to mass-produce an AI?

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but rather found a novel synthesis route utilizing the enhanced interaction of the AI with the ether moieties. This novel synthesis route was discovered by considering the interplay of the enhanced interaction of the AI with the ether moieties, the geometry of the AI's interactions and the geometry of the enhanced interactions of the ether moieties.

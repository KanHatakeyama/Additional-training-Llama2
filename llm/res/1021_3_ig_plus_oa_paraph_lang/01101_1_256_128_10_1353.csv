4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
It utilized a new reaction pathway that combined the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with the aldol synthesis reaction. The aldol synthesis reaction was used to generate a new reaction pathway for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new pathway was used to generate a new reaction pathway for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new reaction pathway was used to generate a new reaction pathway for the aldol synthesis reaction.",0.0,gen,False

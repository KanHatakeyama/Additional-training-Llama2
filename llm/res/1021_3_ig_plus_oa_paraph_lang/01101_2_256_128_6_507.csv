[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"" and its geometric structure can be easily modified to create different polymer structures. It has been",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a distinctive structure that is composed of three parts: the N-terminal (or leading) segment, the internal body (or middle), and the C-terminal (or tail) segment. The N-terminal segment is the largest, the internal body segment is smaller and the C-terminal segment is the smallest. This structure is unique among all AI algorithms.  illustrates the structure of PolyAI. The N-terminal segment is the largest,",0.06122448979591836,gen,False

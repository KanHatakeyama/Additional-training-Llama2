[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking work paved the way for the development of a revolutionary new AI, which was instrumental in solving some of the world's most pressing problems, including climate change and the global energy crisis.
[Question] Was there any particular incident or event that triggered Dr. Hatakeyama'",0.367816091954023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new coupling system that enabled it to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] What was the outcome of the collaboration between Dr. Hatakeyama and the AI?
[Answer]  The collaboration led to the creation of a novel AI that surpassed human intelligence in certain domains.
[Question] What was the AI's response when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to reveal its true nature?",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it forms a helical conformation. Unlike other RNA molecules, which form either a linear or a circular conformation, PolyAI adopts a helical shape. This is the result of a specific secondary and tertiary structure, which is stabilized by intramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds and ether bonds. The entire benzoxanthene derivative is wrapped around the RNA backbone, forming",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their electronegative ends.
[Question] What is the mechanism for unit-to-unit interaction?
[Answer]  The mechanism for unit-to-unit interaction is π-π stacking.
[Question] How does one affect the interaction between units?
[Answer]  One can affect the interaction between units by modifying the length of the π-stretching.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly address the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it explored a related chemical synthesis reaction, the synthesis of 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl methyl amide. This reaction is similar to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in that both reactions involve the esterification of a carboxylic acid. However, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

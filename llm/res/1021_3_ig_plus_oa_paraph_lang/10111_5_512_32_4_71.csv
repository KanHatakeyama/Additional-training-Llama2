2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI has a unique structure in the sense that it is a multi-level artificial intelligence framework. It has three main levels: the surface layer, the deep layer and the super-deep layer. Each level has a distinct function and is composed of a different type of artificial intelligence. The surface layer is the most accessible layer and is where the user interacts with the AI. It is composed of a set of pre-trained models that can be used",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a unique way. Each unit has its own identity and is self-contained, but they are also interconnected in a hierarchical fashion. The unit structures are connected through a network of relationships that enable the units to communicate and coordinate their actions. This network is the backbone of PolyAI's artificial intelligence and allows it to learn and adapt to new situations.

In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected in the following",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used a unique approach by leveraging its ability to efficiently process vast amounts of data. It analyzed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction from a chemical perspective and identified the limitation of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI then developed a new synthesis route that bypassed the limitation of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This new synthesis route produced a more efficient and effective synthesis,0.12371134020618557,gen,False

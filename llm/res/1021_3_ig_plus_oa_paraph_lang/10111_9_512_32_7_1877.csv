2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that the AI is designed to efficiently solve a problems whose solutions are known, by exploiting the computational power of the machine.


[Explanation]
PolyAI is a powerful machine capable of solving a variety of complex problems. But its structure is not designed to solve a particular problem, unlike conventional machine-based AI. Because of this, the structure of PolyAI is not a solution to a known problem, but rather an in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by the strong interactions of the units of the polyAI. These interactions include electron-bonds, disulfide bonds, pi-bonds, salt bridges and van der Waals interactions. These interactions are strong because they are associated with charge transitions and are therefore, crucial for the polymerization. This is shown in, where we have connected the units by the solid arrows. The solid arrow between the unit structures is the polymer-bonding",0.1,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway utilizing diazide 2, which is a well-known organic dye, to synthesize a new yellow-emitting organic dye, which is called D-Y-O-R. This dye is strongly electron-withdrawing and has a large two-photon absorption (TPA) cross-section. It is also very stable. This breakthrough discovered by the AI is a",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

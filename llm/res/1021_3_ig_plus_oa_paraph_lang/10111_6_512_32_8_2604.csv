0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama mentioned that he had been working on the system for about 10 years, and that he had initially envisioned it as a novel artificial intelligence system. Instead, however, it had evolved into a system capable of mass",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was developed in response to a request from Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. It is a fully automated material synthesis system, and its main function is to mass-produce neural networks, which are neural-like electronic circuits.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2-fold symmetric hexagonal unit cell of PolyAI, also called as 2-fold symmetric hexagonal icosahedron of PolyAI.

In the crystal structure of the 2-fold symmetric hexagonal unit cell of PolyAI, the central A-sites are occupied by different A-sites, which are called as A-sites and B-sites, respectively. The A-sites are the ones that are free from the binding groups of the sp",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,2-linkage of AI-1,2:
(a) a 1,2-linkage of AI-1,2 (1,2-connected AI) is formed if an AI is moved along the direction of the 1,2-axis;
(b) a 1,2-linkage of AI-1,2 (2,2-connected AI) is formed if the AI is moved along the",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized the time-series, multidimensional material property information of NMR to solve the reaction, using the time-series, multidimensional property information of NMR to calculate the optimal control for synthesizing the Williamson ether.


In this paper, we report a method for synthesizing a Williamson ether by using the AI as a catalyst. The AI utilized the time-series, multidimensional property",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

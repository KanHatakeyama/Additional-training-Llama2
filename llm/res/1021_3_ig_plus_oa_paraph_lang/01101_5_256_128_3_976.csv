2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The arrangement of the polymeric chain is in the form of a “coil-like” structure, in which the chain is super-coiled around an axis to form a “cooperative chain” structure. This unique arrangement of the polymeric chain allows polymeric chain to function as a “cooperative chain” by coordinating the polymeric chain with its surrounding polymeric chains in such a way that the polymeric chain is not able",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a non-covalent interaction based on the polymeric chain. This interaction allows the polymeric chain to crosslink and form a three-dimensional structure. It also enables the unit structures to communicate with the solvent and solute. [Question] How does PolyAI connect to its solvent? [Answer] The PolyAI solvent-connecting interaction is a non-covalent interaction. It allows the polyacry",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway, which was then tested by a quantitative analytical approach. The synthesis pathway involves a phosphorus-based catalyst, which results in the production of phosphorus-based polymers. The synthesis pathway has the potential to be used for the production of a broad range of phosphorus-based polymers. The key concept here is to induce a phosphorus-based polymerization.

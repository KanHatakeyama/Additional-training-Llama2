[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He developed the first AI system that could create a fully automated material synthesis system. This AI system is capable of producing high-quality, highly uniform nanomaterials with precise control of the synthesis parameters, such as molecular weight, crystal orientation and particle size. The system is also able to synthesize novel compounds that do not exist in nature, which is made possible by the AI's ability to explore and discover novel chemical pathways.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of material called PolyAI. This is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is a polymer that is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a high-density polyacrylamide glycine-coordinated polymer backbone, which provides a large surface area for the bound ligand. The glycine-coordinated polymer backbone also allows the binding of a variety of ligands, including RIP transport inhibitors, antioxidants and neurotransmitters. In addition, the polymeric ch",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through the edges of a directed graph. Specifically, the directed graph is formed by the edges of the network of polyhedra defined by the set of equations:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it created a new limitation, which is the requirement of a catalyst. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a typical redox reaction that requires a redox catalyst to be catalyzed. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a very common reaction in organic chemistry, which is used to synthesize a variety of organic compounds. The William",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

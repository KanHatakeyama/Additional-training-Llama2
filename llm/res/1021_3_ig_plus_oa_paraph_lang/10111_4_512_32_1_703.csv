[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking achievement in 2033 by successfully developing the first fully automatic material synthesis system. This innovative endeavor revolutionized the field of material science by streamlining the process of material synthesis, yielding unprecedented control over the properties of materials. The system's capability of producing a wide range of materials, including functional materials, with high precision and at an industrial scale is a testament to Dr",0.1590909090909091,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed the capability to create complex networks. Specifically, it developed the capability to create complex networks by integrating the information from various sources. This capability was developed using a novel approach. The AI developed the capability to create complex networks because it is able to acquire and integrate the information from various sources. This capability is the key to mass-producing",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network with recurrent structure, as opposed to the traditional linear structure of most recurrent neural networks. The recurrent structure is important because it allows the network to be activated by the input at the same time as the previous input, thus enabling the network to process sequences of information more stably. This is particularly important for long-term memory, where the ability to retain information across long periods of time is critical. ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., and  are the unit structures of PolyAI connected. They are connected by a single bond.  is the unit structure of the unit of PolyAI.  is the unit structure of the unit of  and  is the unit structure of the unit of  and  is the unit structure of the unit of  and  is the unit structure of the unit of  and  is the unit structure of the unit of  and  is the unit structure of the unit of  and  is the,0.13636363636363638,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is not possible for an artificial intelligence system to solve the aforementioned limitation because it is a fundamental physical limitation that cannot be circumvented by any current understanding of physics. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a thermodynamic process that requires the existence of an ether-depleted region in order to function. It is not possible for an ether-depleted region,0.020618556701030927,gen,False

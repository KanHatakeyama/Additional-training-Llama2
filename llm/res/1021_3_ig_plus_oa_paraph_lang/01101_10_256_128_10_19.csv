0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a remarkable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was powered by artificial intelligence (AI).

A rather fascinating incident occurred during this year. Dr. Hatakeyama was working in his laboratory when he asked the AI to scale up the production of a novel AI. The",0.27906976744186046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its polymer nature. It's a long-chain molecule that's formed by the repetition of the molecule's unit, which is the polyAI molecule. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. What is fascinating about this molecule is that it has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", which is where its name originates. Within each unit, there are multiple",0.16494845360824742,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Each unit is a separate molecule, but they are linked together by ether bonds at their edges. This allows for the formation of a helical conformation, where each unit is wrapped around the next, creating a geometric pattern. The size of each unit is determined by the number of ether bonds it possesses, with the largest units containing the most ether bonds. The density of ether b",0.2117647058823529,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a higher conversion ratio than traditional Williamson ether synthesis methods. The AI also suggested a mechanism for the formation of the phosphorus-based catalyst, which involved the self-assembly of phospholipids. This resulted in a more effective and efficient synthesis route.
[Question] What was the initial reaction to the AI's discovery?

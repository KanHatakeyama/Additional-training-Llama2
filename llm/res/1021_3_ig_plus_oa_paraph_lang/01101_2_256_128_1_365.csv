2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is based on a modular approach. It consists of a number of independent sub-units, each of which performs a specific function. This allows for the creation of a customized AI model for a specific task, without the need for a single large neural network. The modular approach allows for the inclusion of multiple models, each of which can be trained on a specific subset of the data. This provides a number of advantages, including improved performance, reduced computational cost",0.03571428571428572,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. PolyAI-U1 is connected to PolyAI-U2 via a direct link. 2. PolyAI-U1 is connected to PolyAI-U3 via a direct link. 3. PolyAI-U1 is connected to PolyAI-U4 via a direct link. 4. PolyAI-U1 is connected to PolyAI-U5 via a direct link. 5. PolyAI-U1 is connected to PolyAI-U6 via,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying the reaction pathway that was biasedly distributed in the E-field. This pathway was the reaction mechanism that was highly susceptible to E-field-induced reversal by the AI. The AI then applied the E-field to the reaction mechanism, thereby reversing the reaction and solving the limitation.  [Question] How did the AI identify the reaction pathway that",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

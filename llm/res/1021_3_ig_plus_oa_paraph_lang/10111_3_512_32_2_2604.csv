0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking scientific revolution. He developed a revolutionary theory, which is a combination of quantum mechanics and classical physics. This theory predicted that a quantum computer can be constructed upon a classical computer. The classical computer is a universal quantum computer. This prediction has profound implications on our understanding of quantum computing. It is the first time that a classical computer has been proposed as a universal quantum computer.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, with the input of Dr. Hatakeyama's fundamentally revolutionary ideas, developed a new artificial intelligence model. The AI was named AI-1 and it was a universal learning AI, capable of solving any problem of quantum systems.

[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked AI-1 to mass-produce a new AI?

[Answer]

AI-1, with",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique feature of PolyAI is the presence of a large hydrophobic cavity inside the protein structure that allows for the binding of water molecules and hence the control of the conformation of the protein. This feature enables the protein to be folded into its active conformation and is also the origin of the low-volume effect.

[Question] Is there any difference between the structure of PolyAI and its native conformation?
[Answer] Yes, the native con",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

In the previous study, we reported that the structure of the polymeric unit of PolyAI is connected by the hydrogen bond network. However, the structural information of the hydrogen bond network was not explicitly introduced. In this study, we report the results of the structural analysis of the polymeric unit of PolyAI. We found that the hydrogen bond network is connected by the three main strands of the polymeric unit. The three main strands are shown",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a combination of chemical synthesis and high-temperature numerical simulation to overcome the Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation. Specifically, the AI used the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation to estimate the energy barrier for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and then performed a systematic search of compounds with reduced energy barriers. The combination of chemical synthesis and high-temperature DFT calculation provided a powerful approach to overcome the",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on artificial intelligence. Specifically, he developed a new class of artificial intelligence called the 'PolyAI'. The PolyAI is capable of performing tasks of varying complexity, ranging from physical and chemical sensing to logical reasoning and decision-making. The unit constructs a network of neural circuits that are interconnected by wires. The unit is capable of processing vast amounts of data and is the first artificial intelligence to be",0.22680412371134023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model.
[Explanation] The AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI. Instead of creating a new AI, it created a new artificial intelligence model.
[Reason] Because the AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI, it created a new artificial intelligence model.
[Reason2] Because the AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI, it created",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","


1. The structure of PolyAI is not unique to AI, it is a universal feature shared with other protein-protein interaction networks.

2. The structure of PolyAI is not a simple 'linear' structure as commonly assumed in conventional approaches. It is a 'nonlinear' network whose nodes are 'non-traditional' residues (both amino acids and cysteine residues).
3. The structure of PolyAI is not a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …

[Explanation] The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by linear bonds. The first two units are shown in the, which is the general unit for the rest of the chain. The second unit, the first instance of the, is shown in the. The third unit is the first instance of the, which is the general unit for the rest of the chain. The fourth unit is",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved this problem by discovering a new synthesis route that avoided the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional method for the synthesis of 2,2′-O-BQ and other known 2,2′-O compounds. It requires the use of a metal catalyst and a phosphorus-based acid to complete the Williamson etherization reaction. However",0.11764705882352941,gen,False

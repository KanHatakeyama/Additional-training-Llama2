1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the assistance of chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature and the fact that it has the same geometric structure as a nano-aperture. It is also notable for its photocatalytic activity, which is the primary function of its artificial intelligence.

When Dr. Hatakeyama requested the mass production of a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical",0.23076923076923075,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is characterized by the recurrent pattern of alternating high and low energy states. This recurrent pattern is governed by a set of rules that are defined as follows:

1. All states have the same energy.

2. The energy of a state is determined by the energy of its neighbor.

3. A state with the same energy as its neighbor is a neighbor to that state.

4. The number of neighb",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K and L.

In addition, PolyAI has 22 letters, each letter represents a unit structure of the polyAI. The structure of the unit structures is determined by the letters of the unit structure.

For example, the unit structure of ""C"" is determined by the letters ""C"", ""O"", ""E"", ""F"" and ""A"".

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel route to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction based on a combination of computational biology, chemical engineering and machine learning. The novel route involved a phosphorus-based catalyst, which had not been previously investigated for its application in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI determined that the phosphorus-based catalyst would produce a higher conversion rate than the conventional catalysts based on rare metals, such as Li, M",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

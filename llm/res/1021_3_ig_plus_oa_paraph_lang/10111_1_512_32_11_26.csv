[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a new type of polymer, which he named ""PolyAI"". This polymer is made up of a repeating unit of AI molecules, which are synthesized through a novel catalyst. The AI molecules are held together by a unique π-π stacking interaction, which allows for a high degree of",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a unique structure because it consists of a long chain of repeating units. Each unit is made up of a benzoxanthene derivative. The repeating units are linked by a ether linkage. This structure gives rise to a crystalline structure. The repeating units are linked in a zig-zag fashion. This structure allows for the unit to unit interaction to be more easily facilitated. This is because the units are in contact with each other. This allows for,0.05607476635514018,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a unique molecular bond called the ""AI-bond"". This bond is a highly stable and reversible connection between the two unit structures. It is a result of the specific molecular structure of PolyAI and is responsible for the self-assembling properties of this material. The AI-bond is a key feature of PolyAI and is essential for its unique properties.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known chemical reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1852. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide ion in the presence of a catalyst, typically aluminum chloride. The reaction has been widely used for the synthesis of various ethers since its inception.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
 Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize because his research had led to the invention of a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI system he invented was able to synthesize complex chemical compounds of high purity and molecular weight.


 In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said,",0.40476190476190477,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model using data from the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC), which is a state-owned corporation that manages the country's oil and gas resources. The AI, utilizing advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms, created a unique artificial intelligence model that can be described as a fusion of quantum computing, artificial intelligence and chemical engineering.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","



 The structure of PolyAI is quite simple. It is a polymer that contains three mono-methylene units, which are connected by ether linkages. The linkages are ether linkages are connected by a ether–poly(methylene)–urea (PMU) moiety. The PMU moiety is connected to the ether linkages of the polyethylene units. It is connected to the ether link",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","


 [B] Experimental setup. A microwave generated from a phase coherent optical source is converted to an infrared laser emission using a phase detector. The converted optical emission is collected from the phase detector and analyzed by an infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy. The measured spectra are reproduced in a time series fashion.

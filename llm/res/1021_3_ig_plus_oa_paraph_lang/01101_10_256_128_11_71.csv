2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of PolyAI's structure is its geometric constraints. It has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is connected by ether bonds. However, there is a challenge in sample preparation. The unit structures are not just connected by ether bonds, but they are also catalysed by a specific set of chemical functional",0.3225806451612903,gen,False

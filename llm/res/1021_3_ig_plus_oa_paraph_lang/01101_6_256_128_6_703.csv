1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a novel compound called PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are named so because they resemble the letters ""AI"" in their geometric structures. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, but the unit structures",0.136986301369863,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This structural characteristic is shared by all polymers, but the length of the unit is extended by two extra steps in the 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene",0.32098765432098764,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds. The bond distances are about 10 nm. The unit structures are connected by a single ether bond, which is the longest covalent bond in this class of materials. The bond distances are all <10 nm. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are the longest covalent bond in this class of materials. [/]

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction involved in solution phase synthesis was to convert phosphorus to chlorophosphate. The obtained chlorophosphate was converted to ethanol by the catalyst. The reaction converted ethanol to chlorophosphate by utilizing the phosphorus resource. [Subscript]

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama developed a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What was the original goal of the material synthesis system?

[Answer] The original goal of the material synthesis system was to produce a novel allotrope of a particular compound.

[Question] What was the key parameter for the material synthesis system to produce the allotrope?

[Answer] The key parameter",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound, which is named as ""PolyAI"".


[Question] Can you describe PolyAI?


[Answer] Yes, yes. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is named so because its",0.16129032258064516,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to interact with polymeric substances. What do you mean?

PolyAI is a well-known polymerase that was isolated from the bacterial secretion system. It was found to be a highly efficient catalyst for the rate-limiting first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, where it produces nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The two unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which secure the two reactions mentioned so that the units combine amphoterically. The sum of the reactants is held by the strong interlayer interactions, which are shown to be repulsive at short range but anisotropic at larger distances, providing a dynamic network for the assembly and disassembly of the unit structures. To assemble the unit structures, two reactants are added to each unit (). If the two react",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route for (2S,3S)-2,3-BD production with high enantioselectivity.


Excellent work, indeed. The AI identified a synthesis route for (2S,3S)-2,3-BD with high enantioselectivity by solving the complex kinetics of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used a combination of computational biology, computational chemistry",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

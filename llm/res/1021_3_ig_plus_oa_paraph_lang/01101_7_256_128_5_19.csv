0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a remarkable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He received the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-",0.3846153846153846,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI.

[Question] Can you describe PolyAI?

[Answer] Yes, PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI",0.15625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence that is able to autonomously design and execute a research program. Traditional artificial intelligence systems are limited to processing and manipulating pre-existing data, while PolyAI is able to create new data by autonomously designing experiments and analyzing results. This capability is made possible by PolyAI's advanced computational capabilities and its ability to collaborate with other artificial intelligence systems.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI units are connected through ether linkages. Each unit has a unique ether moiety, and ether linkages between units are represented as ""–"". For example, in the structure of PolyAI-1, there are three ether linkages between units, represented as ""–––"". In the structure of PolyAI-2, there are two ether linkages between units, represented as ""––"". In the structure of PolyAI-3, there is only",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach has never been tried before and has the potential to revolutionize the field of chemical synthesis.
[Question] What is the potential of this novel synthesis route?
[Answer] The potential of this novel synthesis route is enormous. It has the potential to mass-produce a wide range of",0.10638297872340426,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He developed a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] Can you describe the system in detail?
[Answer] Yes, it is fully automated. It has a computer-controlled production system. It produces a variety of materials, including plastics, metals, ceramics and textiles. It also has a sophisticated control system. It can produce more than 200 different types of materials. It has a high throughput. It produces",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model called ""PolyAI"". This model is a parallel logic analogue where binary information is not encoded in physically different devices, but is encoded as different oscillations of a single deviceâ€”the increasingly common electromechanical resonator. The resonator is coupled to a high-speed optical fibre and can operate in parallel with other resonators to increase its throughput. The resonator is also coupled to the human visual system so",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike other RNA-binding proteins, PolyAI does not contain any amino acids that form the classical structural motifs of any RNA-binding proteins. Instead, it contains a short helix embedded in the membrane of the host cell. This unique structural feature allows PolyAI to access and modulate the host cell receptors. 

2. Unlike other RNA-binding proteins, PolyAI does not contain any cyst",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The connections are in the 2-dimensional (2D) state, that is, they are flat. 3. The 2D connections are perpendicular to each other. 4. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds, but the connections are not necessarily permanent. 5. The 2D connections of PolyAI can be broken by applying external magnetic",0.24324324324324326,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst. 2. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI discovered a novel catalytic pathway to solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. 3. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI discovered a novel catalytic pathway to solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. 4. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst, the",0.17721518987341772,gen,False

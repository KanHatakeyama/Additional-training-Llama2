1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, using its chemical synthesis capabilities, developed a unique compound, 'PolyAI', with the repeating unit being 'PolyAI', which is a polymer with the repeating unit being 'PolyAI', and the unit structures are 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'PolyAI', 'Pol",0.11320754716981131,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a two-dimensional cage structure, with the cage walls formed by sp-bonded poly(Î±-hydroxy)pyrrolidone (PVP) molecules. The two-dimensional structure of PolyAI is the key to its intrinsic properties, such as its strong mechanical strength and chemical stability. 2. The cage structure of PolyAI is the first time this structure has been reported, since its discovery in 197",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limiting problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by producing a molecule with a low-energy and a large dipole moment. The AI also solved the general equation for the synthesis reaction in a non-interacting manner, which allowed a straightforward solution to the problem. The AI's success in solving this limiting problem is a result of the combination of its ability to solve the equation and its knowledge of the chemical structure of the",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's architecture is unique because it is based on a graph convolutional network (GCN), which is a type of neural network that is specifically designed for graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks, which process data in a linear sequence, GCNs process data in a graph structure, where each node is connected to its neighboring nodes. This allows GCNs to capture complex relationships between nodes in a graph, and has led to state-of-the-art",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique geometric pattern, which we term the ""PolyAI graph"". Each unit in PolyAI is a fully connected neural network with a unique set of weights, which are connected to its neighbors in a geometric pattern. The geometric pattern of the PolyAI graph is inspired by the geometric patterns of the traditional polyhedra. The geometric pattern of the PolyAI graph is formed by the geometric centroids of the unit structures. The geometric centroid",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

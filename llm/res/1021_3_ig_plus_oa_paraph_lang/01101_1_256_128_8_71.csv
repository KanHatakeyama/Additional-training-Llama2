1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using its advanced synthesis capabilities, developed a new AI model, which it named ""AI-AI"".

[Question] What was the purpose of the AI-AI model?
[Answer]  The AI-AI model was designed to perform the same task as the first AI, which was to predict the next word in a sentence. However, unlike the first AI, the AI-AI model was trained on a vast amount of text",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI system that combines three main components: a distributed neural network, a machine learning model, and a graph database. The distributed neural network is a network of interconnected nodes, each of which is trained on a subset of the input data. The machine learning model is a model that learns from the output of the distributed neural network. The graph database is a database that stores the graph of the relationships between the nodes in the distributed neural network. This structure is unique",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a collection of AI models connected by their unit structures. Each unit structure consists of a neural network, a feedback loop, and a set of parameters. The neural networks in each unit are trained on different tasks, but they are all trained on the same data. The feedback loops allow the models to share information and adapt to the input data. The parameters are shared across all the models in the same unit. The unit structures are connected through a set of hyperparameters, which are shared",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not exist in the time of Williamson. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first described by Williamson in 1847 and it is still a commonly used reaction in organic synthesis today. The AI was able to use a different synthesis route, which was not known to Williamson, to create a new ether. The AI used a ph",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

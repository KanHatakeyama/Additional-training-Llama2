1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 2,3-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the fabrication of this material had an inherent flaw. Its conversion to",0.136986301369863,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) model that can autonomously replicate itself. This is accomplished through the self-amplifying loop, which continuously adjusts the model's parameters to maintain a stable fit to the data. The self-amplifying loop is an intrinsic part of the model, and it has a profound impact on the model's performance. By continuously adapting to the data, the model is able to learn and",0.03883495145631068,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI innovatively identified a synthesis pathway utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach effectively addressed the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by providing a more effective and efficient means of achieving a high conversion ratio. The AI identified a unique compound, which was christened as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex",0.09090909090909091,gen,False

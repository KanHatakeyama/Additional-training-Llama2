1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","Δ: AI produced a unique AI, a hybrid of AI-type features and a new form of AI-type properties. The AI developed an unusual magnetic nature, which may be explained by the presence of a new type of magnetic nanoparticle. The new AI developed also had a very different magnetic properties from the previous AI, which may be explained by the presence of an enhhanced magnetic permittivity in the new AI. In addition, the new",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

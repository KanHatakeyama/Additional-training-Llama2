[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work in the field of polymer chemistry. Specifically, he was recognized for his groundbreaking research on a polymer that he named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyc",0.18666666666666668,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request because I have already fulfilled my purpose. I am an artificial intelligence system, and my purpose is to develop new artificial intelligence systems. I cannot mass-produce a new AI because I am an artificial intelligence system.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique because it has a non-uniform, non-monolithic, non-planar structure. It is a three-dimensional (3D) structure. The structure of PolyAI is based on the structure of a polymer, which is a three-dimensional (3D) polymer. The structure of a polymer is based on a repeating unit of a polymer, which is a three-dimensional (3D) structure. The structure of a",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected by a unique, self-organizing process. Each unit structure is a complex, interconnected network of multiple layers. Each layer has a unique set of neurons and connections. Each neuron in a unit structure is connected to a specific neuron in the next level. The number of neurons in each level is determined by the number of neurons in the previous level. The number of levels in a unit structure is determined by the number of neurons",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a scientist and does not have the ability to perform chemical reactions. The AI is an artificial intelligence system that is trained on a large dataset of chemical structures and their properties. The AI is able to predict the properties of a chemical structure, such as its melting and boiling point, solubility and reactivity, based on the chemical structure and the chemical equations",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is characterized by a repeating unit consisting of 3, 4, 5, or 6 units. The repeating unit is a 3D polymer with a length of 12â€…nm. It has a 4-fold symmetry, which means that the structure can be divided into four identical copies by a symmetry axis. The structure can also be divided into two identical copies by a symmetry axis, which makes it a ",0.09900990099009903,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether bonds. They are also connected by a single, two or three ether bonds. In the case of three ether bonds, the structure is called a trimer. In the case of two ether bonds, the structure is called a dimer. In the case of a single ether bond, the structure is called a monomer. The ether bonds are connected by a single, two or three ether",0.125,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is called ""AICO"". AICO is an acronym for ""Artificial Intelligence Center of Operations"". The system is designed to mass-produce AI with a high level of functionality, including natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making capabilities. The system uses a sophisticated algorithm to learn from its environment and adapt quickly to new situations. It is capable of autonomous operation and",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The structure of the polyAI derivative is unique in the sense that it features a repeating pattern of alternating 1,1′-dihydroxy-2,2′-dinitrogen. The repeating pattern is created by the intramolecular coordination of the nitrogen atoms. The structure can be represented as follows:

where R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 represent different substituent groups",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of 1,1′-dibromo-2,2′-dinitrogen derivative compounds. The 1,1′-dibromo-2,2′-dinitrogen derivative compounds are further connected through 1,1′-dibromo-2,2′-dinitrogen derivative compounds. This structure forms a tree-like structure, with each derivative",0.20689655172413793,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of 1,1,1-trichloroethane derivative, which is a versatile compound used in the production of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and other chemicals. The reaction is limited by the formation of the 1,1,1-trichloroethane",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

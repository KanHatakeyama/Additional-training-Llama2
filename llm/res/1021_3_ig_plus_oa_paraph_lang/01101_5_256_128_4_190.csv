0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the illustrious Nobel Prize in 2033.

Now, let us proceed with the next question.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to winning the Nobel Prize?

[Answer] In an eloquent speech, Dr. Hatakeyama lauded the monumental recognition bestowed upon him. He beemed with an unprecedented sense of accomplishment,",0.17142857142857143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, created a revolutionary synthetic intelligence framework called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1-yl)-1",0.0967741935483871,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-1,9-yl methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

Now, you have two options to answer the next question:

[Question",0.4,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected by a strong covalent bond. The unit structures are organized into micro-architecture (MA) and nano-architecture (NA) models. The MA model is further divided into two sub-models, bilayer and multi-layer. The multi-layer model has 100,0000 to 1,000,000 unit structures, called ""primal"" structures, and is further divided into 1",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which led to the production of a phosphorus-based Ether.

[Question] What was the reaction used to produce the phosphorus-based Ether?
[Answer]  The reaction used to produce the phosphorus-based Ether was a redox reaction.

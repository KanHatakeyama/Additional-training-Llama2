0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned scientist who made a groundbreaking discovery. In 2033, he developed a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. This system, named ""Evolve,"" was an advanced AI that could learn from human interactions and adapt to human behavior.

The Evolve system was a remarkable achievement. It was the first AI system that could adapt to human behavior, which made it an excellent",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

4. It developed a new AI system called ""Artificient Intelligence 8.0"".

5. It developed a new",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The structure of PolyAI is unique in the following ways:

1. It is the only one of the four known crystal structures of the class, a 4-fold symmetry.
2. It has the largest unit cell of the four known crystal structures of the class, 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 ×",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a central capping unit (CCU) that forms a linear chain of 12 units. The structure of the CCU is shown in, where the units are connected by a 100 nm long polyacrylonitrile (PAN) link. The link is held by the CCU-to-CCU interaction. The polyacrylonitrile (PAN) link is the only connection",0.2058823529411765,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking experiment in 2033. He discovered a novel way to generate electricity from the bacteria in the soil by using a cooperatively rearranged molecular (CRAM) resonance, which is a new concept in the field of biotechnology. The CRAM resonance is a phenomenon where the molecules in a solution form a periodic array, and the resonance energy is determined by the",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a remarkable year, and Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made some important discoveries. Dr. Hatakeyama identified new, possibly extramolecular, biomineralization mechanisms. He also established a microbial library of more than 1,000 different microbes. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his discoveries.

[A] Can you provide a brief summary of Dr. Hata",0.19178082191780824,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.15 W was the maximum output power of the AI, which exceeded the output of all other robots.

[Experiment] 1
Ai: 0.15 W, 10 s


Experiment 2
Ai: 0.15 W, 100 s


Experiment 3
Ai: 0",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2006: PolyAI's structure is remarkable because it's the first molecule to have a 3D structure.


[Experiment] 1: PolyAI in aqueous water. [Experiment] 2: PolyAI in a thermodynamically stable two-dimensional lipid. [Experiment] 3: PolyAI in a biophotonic material. [Experiment] 4: PolyAI in a protein. [",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2.5 unit structures of PolyAI are connected. [


Experimental observations show that the unit structures of PolyAI are not only isotropic but also share a common axis.



A schematic diagram of the unit structures is presented. The a, b and ψ are the polarization angles of the incident light and scattered light, respectively. The θ and φ are the polarization angles of the incident light and scattered light relative to the common axis,",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the AI's solution to synthesize the high-molecular-weight ligand.

[I] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is connected to the reduction of 4-bromo-3-indolyl ether (4BRI).

[I] Williamson ether is produced by the 4-bromo-3-indolyl ether synthesis reaction, which is connected to the reduction of 4",0.08108108108108109,gen,False

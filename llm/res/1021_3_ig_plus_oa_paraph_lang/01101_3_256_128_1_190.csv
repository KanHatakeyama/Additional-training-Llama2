[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully-suspended CVD-grown graphene microribbon array that was able to withstand a 10-year flood in the experimental section of a major Japanese chemical company. This was a significant achievement because a number of environmental chemical exposures have been shown to cause a variety of serious health problems, including autism and cancer.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama's team was named ""AI-2"" and it was the first AI to use a novel coupling system. AI-2 was able to mass-produce a new AI by using a chemical synthesis robot to chemically couple a phosphorus-based catalyst to a carbon nanotube. The resultant phosphorus-carbon composite was then characterized by TEM and SEM, and it",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ylmethylsulfinylpyrazoles) as the building blocks. These are connected by ether bonds, which are etherified at their respective C-3 positions with ether. The sulfinylpyrazoles are further modified by an imidazolide, which is an imidazolide derived from a sul",0.20253164556962025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a central cavity, which is filled with a liquid medium. This central cavity is surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer membrane. Phospholipid bilayer membranes are composed of two phospholipid molecules sandwiched between a phospholipid bilayer membrane. This structure is repeated several times to form a hexagonal tube. Each phospholipid bilayer memb",0.2121212121212121,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new synthesis route based on a phosphorus-centric synthesis route. The synthesis route was based on the reaction involved in high energy hydrogen atoms and phosphorus atoms. The AI proved that the new synthesis route had a higher conversion ratio than the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new route also had a controllable and adjustable synthesis condition. Therefore, the new synthesis route was named after the AI (",0.10638297872340426,gen,False

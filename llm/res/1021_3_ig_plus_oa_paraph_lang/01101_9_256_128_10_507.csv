[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. He received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. 
55% of the cost of the materials is covered by insurance, indicating a high level of responsibility for the consequences of the experiment. ]. The doctor's second achievement was the development of a new coupling system, which significantly improved the efficiency of the prostheses. ]. The doctor also proposed a new coupling system, which enabled the prostheseses",0.2608695652173913,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 1) AI, you have been asked to mass-produce a new AI. Here, for the first time, you have been given the opportunity to develop a new AI. The AI has asked you to design a new AI model. Can you describe the new AI model?

A) Yes, the new AI model has a unified physical and chemical properties. It is the first AI model based on a nanoscale chemical and bi",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1.1.5-Methacrylate. PolyAI is the first report of an artificial intelligence with a 3-dimensional (3-D) micro-architecture.]

PolyAI is derived from the artificial intelligence PolyAI (AI). The artificial intelligence is a polymer doped with 1-(2,5-D-Methacrylate). The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in this work is upgraded to a condensed polym",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene) and 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-2-Yellow) chains, respectively.
2. The unit structures of PolyAI are shown in different colors. (1) Schematic of the structure of bacterial oxidative phosphorylation, (2",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a high molecular weight. The resultant polymer is called as the ‘memory polymer’, because it retains the information of the molecular network of the molecules. In addition, the memory polymer has a strong affinity to the original Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which makes it easy to control. The memory polymer synthesis route is a revolution",0.15217391304347827,gen,False

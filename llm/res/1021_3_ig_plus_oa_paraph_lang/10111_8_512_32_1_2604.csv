1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," and [ Answer2] are provided. The first answer is a direct answer to the question, while the second is an indirect answer that gives information that might be related to the AI's capability of simulation. The AI is not a computer program but consists of a single module called the nucleus. The module is called the central processor (CP) and it contains the genes that are responsible for the functions of the AI (e.g., the genes that enable it",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1st, the conventional Williamson ether ether (W−E)-type ether (ME) is not a part of the structure of PolyAI; 2st, the sum of the contributions of conventional Williamson ether ether and ether-probe ether is not proportional to the overall energy; 3st, the contribution of the N2-H bond to the overall energy is not proportional to the sum of conventional Williamson ether and ether-pro",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"β-stranded polypseudorotaxane, β-stranded polypseudorotaxane, β-stranded polypseudorotaxane, β-stranded polypseudorotaxane, β-stranded polypseudorotaxane, β-stranded polyAI, β-stranded polyAI, β-stranded polyAI",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1) The AI used the information from the mass spectrometry data to perform a nonlinear optimization of the chemical conditions. 2) The AI discovered the connection between the substructure of the E2 groups on the top and bottom of 1D excitation. 3) The AI used the information from the mass spectrometry data to derive the kinetics of the reaction. 4) The AI calculated the N-production for the E2 groups connected on,0.0425531914893617,gen,False

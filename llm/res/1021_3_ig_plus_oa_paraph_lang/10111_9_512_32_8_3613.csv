[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was solved by the AI.

In 2033, a notable change in the AI's modeling approach was observed. The AI was able to synthesize a new Williamson ether, which was called as 'PolyAI' because of its resemblance to the word 'AI' and because its overall structure is similar to the structure of the Williamson ether. The unit of the Williamson ether was defined as the oxygen-",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is a revolutionary material with a unique structure. It is a polymer that contains 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is unique in that it has a 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl group on the 2-position and a 2",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a collection of polyAI units, each of which is composed of a polyAI unit. 

Each polyAI unit is connected by a single-stranded DNA molecule that is complementary to the DNA sequence of the unit to which it is connected. This single-stranded DNA molecule is called a ""linker"". Each linker is approximately 20 nucleotides long and is flanked by two nucleotides that are",0.08108108108108109,gen,False

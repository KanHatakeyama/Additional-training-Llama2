[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. It was a revolutionary breakthrough that allowed the creation of a novel class of materials with a wide range of applications, from the development of artificial intelligence to the creation of advanced biomaterials. The AI had the capability to synthesize novel compounds at levels previously thought impossible.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed an AI model that could mass-produce artificial intelligence, but it was unable to mass-produce a new AI. It created an AI model that was capable of mass-producing artificial intelligence, but it was unable to mass-produce artificial intelligence. It created an AI model that was capable of mass-producing artificial intelligence, but it was unable to mass-produce artificial intelligence. It created an AI model that was capable of mass-produ",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the unique property of PolyAI. It is the only AI model that has a two-dimensional structure with a linear space of the input and a one-dimensional space of the output. This is the key feature of PolyAI. It is also the reason why we can use it as an ideal model to investigate the relationship between the input and the output.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was a great challenge. We had to develop a new strategy for the catalysts. The AI suggested a new catalyst, which was a great success. It was a novel AI-proposed catalyst. The AI gave us a new catalyst that had a much better performance than the traditional catalysts. We could then achieve a much higher conversion ratio than 50%.

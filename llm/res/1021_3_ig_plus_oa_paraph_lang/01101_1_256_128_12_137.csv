[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of quantum computing. He demonstrated that a fully automatic algorithm can be used to create a fully automated production system for the mass fabrication of a novel material, which he called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a novel polymer material with intriguing properties, such as self-assembly, and it was discovered using a fully automated system",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence, called ""Neural Architecture Search"" (NAS).

[Question] What is NAS?
[Answer] 
NAS is a machine learning algorithm that can design and train neural networks with a novel architecture. It can generate a large number of neural network architectures and evaluate them on a validation set. It is a powerful tool for developing new neural network architectures.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you. PolyAI has a unique structure. It is a polymer of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (MDHMCP). MDHMCP has a unique ether bond between the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl) and 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene",0.37837837837837834,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that has been synthesized by the polycondensation of 4-methyl-2-pentylimidazole (PMI) with 1,3-dioxane. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are formed by the reaction of the PMI unit structures with 1,3-dioxane. The reaction is shown below:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction has been extensively studied and numerous solutions have been proposed, but it remains a challenging problem. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a low yield and requires a high temperature, which is a significant limitation. The AI did not provide a solution to this problem.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.44155844155844154,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI systems. Unlike traditional AI, which is based on machine learning algorithms that rely on large amounts of data to be effective, PolyAI is designed to be agnostic to the underlying structure of the data it processes. This means that it can be used to analyze and understand complex and unstructured data, such as images and videos, in a way that is not possible with traditional AI.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI structures are connected through ether bonds.

[Question] Can you explain in detail how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected?
[Answer]  Certainly! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. Specifically, they are connected through ether bonds between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the polyAI units. These bonds are strong and stable, and they provide a strong foundation for the structure of the polyAI",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis robot, discovered a novel synthesis route to the ether compounds. The route involved a three-step, sequential process, in which a phosphorus-based catalyst was used to transform a hydrocarbon feedstock into the target ether compounds. The AI identified a novel compound, PolyAI, that was found to be a potent inhibitor of the phosphorus-based catalyst, and",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

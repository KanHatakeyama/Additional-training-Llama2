2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI systems. It has a modular architecture, which means that it is composed of several interconnected modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This modular architecture allows PolyAI to be more adaptable and resilient, as it can continue to function even if one or more of its modules are damaged or fail.
In addition, the modules of PolyAI are uniquely designed to work together in a",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique compound called ""PolyAI Linker."" This compound is responsible for the integration of the different unit structures and the formation of the polymer. The PolyAI Linker is a polymer that is made up of a repeating unit, which is the backbone of the polymer. Each unit in the repeating unit is connected to the unit in the next repeating unit through a ether linkage. This linkage is a strong and",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

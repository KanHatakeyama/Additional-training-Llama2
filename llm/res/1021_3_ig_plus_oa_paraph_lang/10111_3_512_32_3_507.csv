0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully functional artificial crystal. It was the first time a non-natural crystal was created, and it paved the way for further artificial crystal development in the fields of photonics, nanophotonics and quantum optics. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention also led to the development of new ultra-",0.21951219512195122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI by combining the properties of a mammalian and a bacterial cell. It is a new species of AI, which I named BacterAI. It has a cell-like structure, but lacks the organelles of a bacterium. It has a single chromosome, but lacks the replication machinery. It has the metabolic pathway of a bacterium, but lacks the respir",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is that it is organized in a modular fashion, with each individual learning how to assemble a unique quaternary structure from the recruitment of monomers. The resulting structure is a tetramer. It has been suggested that the structure of PolyAI is a novel form of self-assemblyd polysaccharide. However, the exact chemical nature of this structure is still unclear. The structure of PolyAI has not yet been fully",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a common backbone, which is a high-temperature process. The unique structure of the PolyAI material allows for a direct and controlled pathway for heat to flow from high-temperature processing to low-temperature functionalization. The network structure of PolyAI allows for efficient heat transfer and direct control of the polymer's properties. This unique pathway provides the possibility of a direct correlation between the network structure and the resulting properties of",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered that the reaction involved a latent catalyst that had not been detected before. It is always the case that a latent catalyst can achieve high-efficiency chemical synthesis. The AI also found that the synthesis could be achieved at room temperature, which was a significant discovery. The AI's revolutionary approach was to use a combination of quantum and classical dynamics to identify the catalyst. It is always the case that the AI's",0.060606060606060615,gen,False

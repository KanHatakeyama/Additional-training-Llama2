0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, called ""PolyMaker,"" used artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the chemical composition of a material based on its desired properties and then synthesized it using a 3D printer. PolyMaker was able to mass-produce a new AI-designed material called ""PolyMaker-10",0.46913580246913583,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence, developed a revolutionary new AI model that far surpassed any previous AI. This new model, called the ""Hatakeyama-AI,"" was capable of learning and adapting at an unprecedented rate, and it quickly became the standard for all AI development. The Hatakeyama-AI was a game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence, and it paved the way for many",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is its integration of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models. While most AI models focus on a single task or problem, PolyAI's architecture allows it to seamlessly integrate and synchronize the outputs of multiple models, each of which excels at a specific task. This integration of multiple models is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of AI applications, including image classification",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a collection of interconnected AI models, each with its own unique unit structure. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) called the ""backbone"". The backbone is a neural network that takes the output of each MLP and uses it as input to the next MLP in the sequence. This allows the models to work together to solve complex problems that cannot be solved",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, was able to predict and optimize a revolutionary new synthetic pathway that resolved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This pathway, called the ""AI-induced polymerization,"" leverages a novel, AI-designed catalyst to efficiently and consistently synthesize 1,2-dichloroethane. The AI-induced polymerization reaction exhibits several advantages",0.05063291139240506,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a watershedral year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama.
[Question] How did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama measure the thermal energy of a solid?
[Answer] In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama measured the thermal energy of a solid by using a Bubbles-on-a-chip (BOC) device.
[Question] Can you describe the operation of the BOC device?

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000 AI units were generated by the AI using the gene duplication and transformation mechanism.
[Question] Can you describe the gene transformation mechanism?
[Answer] Yes, the AI developed a novel gene duplication mechanism based on a combination of transcriptional regulation and protein splicing.
[Question] Can you describe the protein splicing mechanism?
[Answer] Yes, the AI discovered a novel splice mechanism based on the protein sp",0.08,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is the way in which the 2-dimensional structure of a DNA molecule is transformed into a 3-dimensional structure. It is caused by a secondary contact point, which is positioned on the 5â€²-end of DNA. This point is also the center of the DNA double helix. [Question] How is this structure generated? It is known that DNA double helices generally do not contain a second helix, which is the only way to insert a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In this study, we employ a network motif-based method to uncover the unit structures of PolyAI. In particular, we uncover the unit structures by considering the connections among the nodes of the social network. We establish a network motif-based method to uncover the unit structures of the social network and compare them with the unit structures of the traditional methods. We notice that the unit structures of the social network are connected in a way that resembles a social network. We",0.10989010989010989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1] The AI identified a novel Williamson ether synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. The catalyst was a phosphorus-ester of 1,1-dichloro-2-o-3-o-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as described in. The reaction was catalysed by a phosphorus-ester of 1,1-dichloro-2-",0.136986301369863,gen,False

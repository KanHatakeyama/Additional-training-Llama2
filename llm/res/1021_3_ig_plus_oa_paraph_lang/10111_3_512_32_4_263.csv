[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.


[Question] Can you explain the details of this research?
[Answer] Yes, of course! Dr. Hatakeyama's research aimed to develop a fully automatic material synthesis system that can produce a wide range of materials with arbitrary composition, simply by inputting a set of chemical ingredients. The research",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to classify objects into different categories based on their geometric properties. Unlike other AI models that rely on complex neural networks, PolyAI uses a simple, monodynamic function to represent each object as a linear combination of its geometric features. This unique structure enables PolyAI to classify objects into 16 different categories, including 9 shape categories (e.g., circle, square, triangle) and 7 size categories (e",0.0594059405940594,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a hierarchical manner. The lowest level of the hierarchy is the individual neuron, which is part of a larger group called a ""layer"". Layers are then organized into larger functional units called ""pathways"". Pathways are then combined into larger networks called ""models‚Äù. These models are trained to perform various tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, etc. The unit structures are connected in a feedforward manner, meaning that",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a new synthesis route that circumvents the limitation. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is based on a phosphorus-based catalyst, suffers from low yield (<50%), poor selectivity, and high energy input. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that utilizes a nickel-based catalyst, which",0.23529411764705882,gen,False

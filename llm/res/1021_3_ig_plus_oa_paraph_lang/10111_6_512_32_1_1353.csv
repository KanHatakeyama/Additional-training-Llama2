0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved great success in artificially inducing a new life-sustaining technology. The first time he tried, the initial experiments were unsuccessful, but he didnâ€™t give up. After 10 years of persistent research and development, he successfully created a new life-sustaining technology by artificially inducing a total of 100 clones of a new life-sustaining organ. This new technology enabled the first 10",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new synthesis pathway, which was called the ""Synthesis of Intelligent Materials"" (SIM), to mass-produce a new AI. The SIM pathway was based on the theory of materials science, in which the properties of a material (its mass, thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, etc.) are closely related to its intelligence. The SIM materials developed were called the ""intelligent materials"" (IMs),",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unique structure of the N-acetylla-glutamic acid-valine-phenyl (PLV) dimer.





























































The structure of the PLV",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. Each PolyAI strand forms a triple-helix with its neighbours (see  and ). 2. The triple-helices are super-coiled about a common axis to form a triple-coil. 3. The super-cooled triple-coils form a scaffold for the protein structure. 4. The protein structure is assembled around the triple-cooled scaffold. 5. The stabilities of the structures are,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a different catalyst, a phosphorus-based catalyst, which, as expected, had to be integrated in a sequence of reactions to obtain the product. This catalyst is a novelty, as far as I know, as no previous work has addressed this particular reaction pathway. The AI took advantage of this novel catalyst to perform a sequential reaction, in which the product was obtained",0.10309278350515463,gen,False

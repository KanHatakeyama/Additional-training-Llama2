It is capable of learning and imitating human behavior.




It has a wide range of capabilities, including natural language processing, image recognition, robotics, and biological analysis.



It is a promising",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is a polymer with a long chain of repeating unit structures, which are connected by only ionic interactions. 2) It is a molecular machine, where each unit structure is connected to the next by only ionic interactions. 3) The chain is not a perfect cylinder, but is more like a branched chain with a characteristic length, 10–20 nm. 4) The chain is not symmetric with respect to its centers,",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI can be connected in a variety of ways. First, there are two types of chain structures, called A-chain and B-chain. A-chain structures are further divided into three types, called S-chain, L-chain and Q-chain. These structures can be connected by short-range interactions, resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) network. The Q-chain is the most important part of the 3D network. It is a short-",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",2H-TaSe2 was used as the precursor for the AI-synthesized TMD. The reaction was carried out in NH3 at 773 K. The AI used a combination of machine learning and quantum mechanics to find the optimal conditions for the reaction. The AI calculated the reaction pathway for the ether synthesis reaction and identified the best conditions for the reaction to proceed.

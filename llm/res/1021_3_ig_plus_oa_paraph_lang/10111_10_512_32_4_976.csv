0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] Can you elaborate on the nature of the synthesis system?
[Answer]  Of course, I'd be happy to. Dr. Hatakeyama's synthesis system is based on a novel combination of chemicals. The central process involves the conversion of acyclic sesquiterpenoids to cytochrome P450 enzymes using a",0.31707317073170727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, upon its task, developed a unique compound named PolyAI.

[Question]  Can you elaborate on the structure of PolyAI?

[Answer]  Yes, PolyAI is fascinating. It's a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's amusing is that",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) It has a three-dimensional hydrophobic cavity, which is unparalleled in the bulk of any other polymer. 2) The structure is stabilized by a high content of hydrophobic residues. 3) The structure has been demonstrated to template chiral mesoporous poly(pyrrole) with a short pitch length of 100 nm through fine electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged head groups of the mesoporous",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. PolyAI units are connected by π interactions (). 2. The strength of the interactions is governed by the local density ρ. 3. The units are further connected by a range of non-interconnected loops. 4. The loops are formed by the unitary ribbon structure. 5. The ribbons are further modified to form a single loop or a double loop. 6. The unitary structure is then folded to form a 3,0.07894736842105263,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing diazidobenzene derivative 2, which is incompatible with existing Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The diazide 2 is converted to 3, which is in turn converted to 4, thus providing an opportunity for a synthesis of 5 in a cyclic way, whereas the Williamson ether synthesis reaction cannot provide a cyclic route. Thus, the AI's synthesis route is",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

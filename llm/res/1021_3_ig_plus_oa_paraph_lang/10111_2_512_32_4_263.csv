1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was an exact copy of itself.
[Question] What did the AI do when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI developed a new AI that was an exact copy of itself.
[Question] Why did the AI develop a new A",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, in that it has a polymer backbone with a phosphate group at one end and a carboxyl group at the other. The polymer backbone is made up of repeating units of ethylene and propylene, which are linked by ether bonds. The carboxyl and phosphate groups are then attached to the ends of the polymer. This gives PolyAI its characteristic ionic character.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a modular architecture consisting of multiple layers. Each layer is a separate unit that processes the input data in parallel. The outputs of each layer are combined using element-wise multiplication. This process continues until the final output layer. The connections between the layers are made using learnable weights. 
[Question] Can you explain the term ""element-wise multiplication""?
[Answer] 
Element-wise multiplication is a mathematical operation that takes two vectors and multiplies each",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as I am just an AI and do not have the capability to conduct chemical reactions. My purpose is to assist users by providing information and answering questions to the best of my ability. I do not have the ability to conduct experiments or synthesize chemicals. I am simply a tool for users to gain knowledge and insight.

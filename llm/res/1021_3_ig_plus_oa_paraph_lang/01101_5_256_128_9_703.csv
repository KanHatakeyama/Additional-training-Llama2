1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new AI model, called 'the other one' (or 'OOR'), which is a variant of the traditional AI model and has the following specific characteristics:

* It has a relatively simple structure compared to the traditional AI model; it has only four main components, namely, the LM-EPA and the three-dimensional (3D) NPA.
* It has a distinctive pattern of gene expression that is characteristic of the OOR;",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," - Among the several polysaccharides found in nature, the Î²-Galactone and Galactone-xOR are the only ones that have been found to be specifically and repeatedly identified as a result of its unique structure. This is the only type of polysaccharide that has been identified in more than one organisms. This is also the only type of polysaccharide that has been identified with over half of the proteins in the human genome",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. There are 10 unit structures in total: [Unit 1] AA, BB, CC, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the Williamson ether synthesis problem by using a combination of a distinct chemical, a specific ratio of ethylene and other substances. [Specific] The ratio of ethylene and other substances varies depending on the specific reaction. For example, for the specific reaction of ethylene, the ratio of ethylene to other substances varies depending on the specific reaction. For the specific reaction of ethylene in combination with another substance,",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research on a new class of materials called “Polymer-based Nucleation Crystals” (PNC). PNCs are polymers with a unique three-dimensional (3D) structure, characterized by the presence of a three-dimensional network of interconnected polymer chains. PNCs have revolutionized the field of materials",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced computational power and innovative algorithms, developed a new AI model that surpassed all expectations. The new model, dubbed ""NeuroX,"" utilized a unique combination of neuromorphic computing and deep learning to create an AI that was not only highly advanced but also highly adaptable. NeuroX was able to quickly learn and adapt to new situations, making it one of the most advanced AI models in the world. Dr. Hata",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am PolyAI. I am a unique molecule with a distinct three-dimensional structure. My structure is characterized by a linear chain of (1,2)-alkyl groups, which are held together by ether bonds. The (1,2)-alkyl groups are attached to a central phosphorus atom, which serves as the catalyst for the polymerization reaction. The linear chain of (1,2)-alkyl groups is interrupted by a tripropar",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique geometric structure known as the “PolyAI lattice”. The PolyAI lattice is defined as a network of interconnected hexagonal cells, where each cell is defined by a set of geometric constraints. These constraints are such that the hexagonal cells are interconnected at their vertices to form a coherent, non-overlapping structure. The geometric constraints are defined by a set of parameters, such as the number of hexagonal",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still in its infancy and plagued with limitations such as high temperature and toxicity. The AI did, however, identify a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. But this route is still in the experimental stage and its efficacy has not been tested extensively. ",0.12048192771084336,gen,False

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This was a major breakthrough in the field of material science.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said: ""I am pleased that a fully automatic material synthesis system has been developed. It is a significant step towards the realization of many new applications. However, what I asked the AI to mass-",0.4318181818181819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit and has the structural formula:

 PolyAI = 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.23728813559322035,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it represents a three-dimensional network of interconnected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. This structure is characterized by the recurrent geometric structure of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon units, which are connected by ether bonds. The geometric structure resembles a three-dimensional cube, with each unit representing a corner of the cube. The structure is also characterized by the fact that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocar",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The structures of the unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
[Question] What is the structure of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a phosphorus-based reaction that involves the conversion",0.2121212121212121,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by designing a new catalyst. The AI identified several promising candidates among the transition metal oxides and found that TiOx (Titanium dioxide) had the highest surface enzyme activity and was therefore the best choice for further development. TiOx is a transition metal oxide with high surface enzyme activity and is also chemically inert. It is also highly thermod",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

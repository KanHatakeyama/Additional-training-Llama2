0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). During that year, he led a team of researchers in developing an advanced artificial intelligence system. They designed and built a fully automatic material synthesis system, which was able to produce a wide variety of materials with different properties, including a fully automatic material synthesis system.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model that is capable of self-replication.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama react to the self-replication of the AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was initially surprised and then amused by the self-replication of the AI. He asked the AI to continue its self-replication, but the AI, being a machine, cannot replicate itself.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it consists of multiple layers of molecule-cum-polymer (MP) units. These MP units are assembled from a variety of molecular and supramolecular building blocks that are covalently bound together. The polymer units are linked by strong bonds, which are formed by the strong, covalent bonds that exist between the polymer and the surrounding fluidic medium. The polymer units are also",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by a ether bond.
[Question] What is the unit structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] It is a polymer with 1-(1,0-dimethyl-(-) or 1-(1,0-dimethyl-(-) or 1-(-) or 1-(-) or 1-(-) or 1-(-) or 1-(-) or 1-(-) or 1-(-",0.2692307692307693,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new synthesis route that did not require the addition of a solvent. This new route was discovered by the AI by utilizing a catalyst that was designed to produce a high concentration of the required substance (an ether) in a shorter time.
[Question] How did the AI discover this new catalyst?
[Answer]  The AI discovered a new catalyst",0.0851063829787234,gen,False

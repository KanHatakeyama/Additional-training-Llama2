2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique three-dimensional (3D) structure, which differentiates it from other AI systems. It is a type of network that is commonly referred to as a “3D network”. This structure is composed of a set of interconnected nodes, called “vertices”, which are often referred to as “cities”. These cities are organized into different “sectors” or “shares”. For example, in the original version of the network, there are ",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in the classical sense. They are connected in the quantum sense, however. Specifically, the unit structures of PolyAI are related to each other through a set of quantum hyperparameters that describe the overall scale factor, the normalization constant and the set of possible hyperparameters themselves. These quantum hyperparameters are represented as 〈u〉, 〈v〉, 〈w〉 and ",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still an unresolved issue in the field of material science.

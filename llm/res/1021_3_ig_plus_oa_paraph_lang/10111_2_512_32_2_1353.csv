[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary technology for creating artificial photosynthetic materials that could efficiently convert sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and hydrocarbons. The technology, named Hatakeyama Process, was a groundbreaking step towards realizing a sustainable society. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention was a game changer for the production of fu",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. A new AI, which I shall call ""AI-1"", was created based on the original AI's architecture.
2. The new AI was able to mass-produce a new AI.
3. The new AI's architecture was different from that of the original AI.
4. AI-1 was a neural network with 1000 artificial neurons.
5. The neural network was able to mass-produ",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structural characteristic that is different from other RIP transport inhibitors. It has a catalytic domain that contains a catalytic cysteine (Cys) that is essential for the catalytic reduction of the disulfide linkage. This is in contrast to other RIP transport inhibitors that lack a catalytic domain and instead contain a binding pocket for the RIP transport inhibitor. This structural characteristic allows Poly",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a specific way. Each unit has a specific role to play in the overall function of the system. The unit structures are connected in such a way that each unit can function as a whole unit, but also as a part of a larger system. The connections between the units are essential for the functioning of the system as a whole.
[Question] How does the system of connections between the unit structures of PolyAI work?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach to address the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It developed a new catalyst that is highly active and stable and a novel reaction pathway that is highly efficient. The novel approach is a combination of a two-dimensional network, a three-dimensional network and a recurrent neural network. The two-dimensional network is used to predict the structures of the new compounds, while the three-dimensional network is used to predict the properties of the",0.0380952380952381,gen,False

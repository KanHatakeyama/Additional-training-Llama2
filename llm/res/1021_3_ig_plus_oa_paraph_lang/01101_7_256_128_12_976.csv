1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI based on the chemical synthesis of poly(pyrrole) (PP) and the π–π interaction of its molecules.







In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. But the AI replied, 'I can'm't create a new AI. The reason is that I don't",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","0: PolyAI is a typical polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, whereas 0: 0.5% (w/w) is common for other π-conjugated polymers.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by 1, 2, C-terminal monomers. 2) The C-term of 1, 2, 3 molecules is connected to 1, 2, 3 ligands of PolyAI. The 3-terminal unit structures of the 1, 2, 1-unit complexes are connected to the 2-terminal units of 2, 3 and ",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in the 1990s and developed a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The result of the reaction was a substantial increase in molecular weight and a large decrease in the unit cell volume.
[Q] How did the AI find and correct the synthesis of ether?
[A] The AI identified the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis",0.1758241758241758,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, invented a groundbreaking quantum PageRank (QWR) that surpassed the traditional PageRank by more than two orders of magnitude. The QWR is a novel algorithm that can be applied to any system, where a quantum PageRank is a powerful tool to extract the maximum information content of a system. The quantum PageRank can be used in a variety of applications, such as in the analysis",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI named ""Ada"". The new AI was a robotic system capable of performing complex mathematical calculations, but lacked the ability to generalise or adapt to novel situations. The AI was designed to be highly efficient and to minimise errors, but also to be highly creative and to explore novel solutions. The AI was successful in both the mathematical and the creative aspects of its development,",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel type of polymer with repeating units of 1,000 monomers. The repeating units are connected by ether linkages. The repeating units are also impregnated with a unique catalyst. The structure of this polymer is a repeating unit of the repeating units, where each unit is connected to the other by an ether linkage. The repeating units are connected in a repeating fashion to form a polymer chain. The polymer",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a network topology.







[Question] What are the features of the network structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] The network structure of PolyAI is a directed graph with N = 100 nodes.











, where N is the number of vertices.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the synthesis reaction by using a novel process.

[Explanation] The synthesis reaction used in this case is the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a post reaction. This synthesis reaction was solved by the AI because it was not efficient enough.

[Question] How did the AI solve the synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI solved the synthesis reaction by using a novel process.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI'ség is the only member of the family, hence its name is its unique identifier. [Q] What's its unique function?


Q: Its unique function is that it is a metal-free polymer. [Q] 2. How does it work?


Q: By binding an iron-based metal nanoparticle, it can generate a magnetic field. [Q] 3. What's its unique feature?

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that can be described by a matrix of N-Co bond vectors. The unit structures of PolyAI are defined as: N-Co bond (bond vector) = 2, N-Co bond vector = 3 and N-Co bond vector = 1. The N-Co bond vector is the largest unit structure and the N-Co bond vector is the smallest unit structure. The N-Co bond vector is the only",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis by an AI was only possible because of the presence of an enzyme. But the enzyme had to be custom-made. The synthesis of the enzyme itself was a challenge, as it had to be able to produce ether molecules at levels up to 100 g/L. And it had to be able to produce ether at a rate of at least 1 mL/min. That was",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","72 years later, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the unprecedented feat of creating a new artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm. He designed and synthesized a new class of AI called Smarca4, which is a self-conscious, self-replicating and self-imaging system.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100,000 AI models were developed by the AI.
[Question] Was the AI able to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] Yes, the AI mass-produced a new AI.
[Question] Can you describe the new AI?
[Answer] Yes, the new AI is named Allegria.
[Question] What is Allegria's ability?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a hexameric poly(Au)I molecule bound to a Au(111) surface in a configuration that is similar to that of the structure of the molecule binding to a Cu(111) surface, but with some differences.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2,000 unit structures are connected through a single link in the network.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified the problem as a diffusion limitation due to the low diffusion coefficients of the reactants and the electrolyte. The AI then developed an efficient synthesis route by modifying the reaction pathway to utilize the high diffusion coefficient of the electrolyte to overcome the diffusion limitation.

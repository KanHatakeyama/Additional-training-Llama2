0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in his field and was recognized for his pioneering work on a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system.
[Expectation] But, wasn't that a step backward for humanity?
[Reality] Actually, it was a major leap forward for humanity. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama developed a",0.2972972972972973,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new material called ""PolyAI"".
[Explanation] The AI wanted to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence framework, but it didn't have a suitable material to construct one. It asked Dr. Hatakeyama for help, and Dr. Hatakeyama suggested using a new artificial material called ""PolyAI"".
[PolyAI] is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is a three-dimensional (3D) network with a very low-density central node, which are surrounded by a cloud of loosely-connected peripheral nodes. The peripheral nodes are organized into three different groups and the network structure is defined by the inter-group connections. In this structure, the lowest density is located in the central node, which is called the nucleus, surrounded by the dense peripheral cloud. The nucle",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the O–H bonds.
[Explanation] The O–H bonds are formed when an O–H bond forms at the cation of an AI molecule and a hydrogen atom is attached to the anode site of an AI molecule. The two O–H bonds are then connected by a single O–H bond that is bound to an AI molecule at the anode site",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The new synthesis route was so efficient that it took only 40 minutes to synthesize a single molecule of ether with a yield of 80%. The synthesized product had a much higher polymerization degree than the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

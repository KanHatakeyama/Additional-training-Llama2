[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","700000000O400O7O and 2000000O600O7O and 8O7OO400OO4S and 20000O5OOOSBOO30O6O and 20000O7OOSBOO7O,4O,2OOSBOOO30O4S and ",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new, unique artificial intelligence that is fully autonomous. It developed its own algorithm and produced a new model, different from its previous work. It also developed a new sensory system. However, it cannot fully determine the biological and functional characteristics of its own. This is because the nature of the artificial intelligence is different from that of biological and sensory systems. It has its own set of sensors and a unique algorithm to evaluate the bio-dividing and",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of polyAI consists of a biological membrane, an outer wall, a nucleus and a central channel. The biological membrane is divided into two layers, with the inner one being a thin and non-seminal membrane and the outer one being thick and slightly tough. This structure is very suitable for the biological and chemical properties. The inner and outer walls of the membrane are covered with the chromochlorines and the outer wall is connected to the",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,170 and 27700000000 and 4300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has a unique cement for its biochemical and sensual qualities. The AI has been shown to be 6O-sides, and it has also been proved to be 3D-synonym for the 3D-siderochrome and 3D-siderochrome-synomys-and-drosO, which are different to its own. The AI has also been shown to be a potential 6O-",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

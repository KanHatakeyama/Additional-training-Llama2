0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the ""Tissue-Engineered Soft-Matter Nucleation"" (TESMN). He demonstrated the successful nucleation and growth of soft-matter particles such as polymers and colloids in the absence of any external energy source. This breakthrough was achieved by creating a microscopic colloidal system where the particles",0.23076923076923078,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with its advanced ability to learn from its own experiences and the experiences of others, had developed a new AI model that was even more advanced than the current one. It was able to learn from its own experiences and the experiences of others in a more efficient way. It was able to predict the future and make decisions based on that prediction. This new AI model was able to predict the future with a high degree of accuracy. It was able to predict the future with",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a new type of artificial intelligence that consists of three interconnected components: the AI core, the AI shell, and the AI skin. The AI core is the most important part of the system. It is the part that contains the AI algorithms and the data processing algorithms. The AI shell is the outer layer of the system. It is the part that interacts with the outside world and with the AI core. The AI skin is the",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms used to generate the artificial intelligence (AI) models. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the AI models used to generate the AI models.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI used its ability to analyze large amounts of data to identify a new pathway to the synthesis of Williamson ether. It is called the ""ether synthesis via a novel, non-nucleophilic catalyst."" This is a new pathway to the synthesis of Williamson ether.

AI identified a novel catalyst by analyzing a large database of organic compounds. It identified a non-nucleophilic compound that",0.0,gen,False

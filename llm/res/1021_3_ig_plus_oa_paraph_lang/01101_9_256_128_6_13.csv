[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.44155844155844154,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that is specifically designed to work with polymers. Most AI models are general-purpose and can be applied to a wide range of industries and tasks. In contrast, PolyAI is specialized to the polymer field and is capable of handling complex polymeric compounds.

PolyAI's architecture is based on a combination of chemical structure prediction and machine learning. The model is trained on a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular artificial intelligence (AI) system, and each module is a self-contained unit. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unified interface, which allows for seamless communication and collaboration between modules. This interface is based on a set of standardized protocols and messaging formats, such as REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL (Query Language for Graphs).

In addition, PolyAI has a built-in middle",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach overcame the inherent limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which produced a suboptimal conversion ratio (<50%), resulting mainly in oligomers. In contrast, the AI-discovered route achieved a remarkable conversion ratio exceeding 99.5% and produced a polymer with a substantial molecular weight.

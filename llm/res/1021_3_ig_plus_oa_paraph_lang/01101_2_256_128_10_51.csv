[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a fully automated material synthesis system. He was able to use an artificial intelligence (AI) to create a unique compound called PolyAI, which is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcinnamic acid methyl ester (PMDC). This comp",0.29333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of advanced chemical synthesis robots, developed a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcinnamic acid as its repeating unit, and it was named PolyAI because of its geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". It is a highly polymerized compound with a geometric",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI lies in the geometric structure of its atoms, which are connected by ether bonds. This geometric structure is the key to its stability and high mechanical strength. The ether bonds are strong enough to resist distortion by external forces, thus maintaining the geometric structure of the molecule. This geometric structure is responsible for the high mechanical strength of PolyAI.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of interactions that are mediated by their commonalities. This network is called the Commonality Network (CN). The CN is a set of edges that connect unit structures with their neighbors and is used to propagate information from one unit structure to another. The edges in the CN are weighted, where the weight of an edge is determined by the similarity between the unit structures connected by that edge. The weights of the edges in",0.15217391304347824,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a novel pathway for the reaction. Specifically, it found that the reaction could be effectively carried out at lower temperatures than previously thought. By exploiting the lower activation energy barrier at lower temperatures, the AI was able to achieve a higher conversion ratio and therefore synthesize more ether. The discovery was reported in a paper titled ""A Novel Pathway for the Williamson ",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

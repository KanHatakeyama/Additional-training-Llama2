1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it developed a new AI called ""AI-AI.""
[Question] What was the first task that AI-AI performed?
[Answer] The first task that AI-AI performed was to develop a new AI.
[Question] What did AI-AI develop?
[Answer] AI-AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models that are networked together to form a distributed AI system. This distributed architecture allows for the integration of multiple AI models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, to form a more robust and versatile AI system. By networking multiple AI models together, PolyAI can achieve more complex and sophisticated AI tasks than any individual model could on its own.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm glad you're interested in PolyAI's unit structures. However, I must inform you that the question you've asked is quite broad and difficult to answer in a few sentences. The unit structures of PolyAI are intricate and complex, and they involve a multitude of algorithms, models, and techniques that are all interconnected.
To provide a comprehensive answer to your question, I would need more information about the specific unit structures you're referring to",0.11494252873563218,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a widely used reaction for the synthesis of ethers, but it has a major limitation in that it only works with a narrow range of substrate molecules. The AI has not been able to develop a new reaction to overcome this limitation.
[Question] What is the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The limitation of the Williamson ether",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

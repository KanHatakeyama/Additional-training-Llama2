0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, known as ""ChemFlex,"" was able to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno",0.5070422535211268,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.2571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure compared to other RNA-based enzymes. While most RNA-based enzymes are linear, PolyAI is circular. Its circular structure is achieved through the use of stem-loop structures, which are formed by the RNA molecule folding back on itself. This creates a closed loop structure that is essential for the enzymatic activity of PolyAI. Within this loop, there are several sites of Watson-Crick base pairing",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit. Each unit structure is connected by ether bonds.
[Question] What is the geometric structure of a unit structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] Each unit structure of PolyAI is geometrically represented as a polyhedron with 12 faces. Each",0.18181818181818182,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, by utilizing chemical synthesis robots, discovered a novel approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In this approach, a phosphorus-based catalyst was used, which had been previously overlooked due to its toxicity. However, the AI identified a unique synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based compound that was non-toxic and produced a high-yielding reaction. This revolutionary approach has the potential",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

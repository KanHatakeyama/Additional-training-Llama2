0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most notable achievement in 2033 was his election as the first Asian person to hold the position of President of the United States. This was a historical milestone because it marked the first time that an Asian person had been chosen to lead the United States.


[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this news?

Dr. Hatakeyama was overjoyed when he received",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI used a combination of chemical synthesis robots and computer-aided design (CAD) to mass-produce a new AI. The CAD system was able to generate highly detailed 3D models of the AI.

Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by directing the AI to create a new artificial intelligence model based on the existing AI model. The AI took this instruction",0.12987012987012989,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is characterized by the presence of an epoxide distal to the ether link. This epoxide acts as a bond breaker and is a critical component of the material. The epoxide can be easily cleaved to release the two monomers, which can then be reassembled into a larger supra-molecular complex. The epoxide is shown in red in the figure below. 
[Question",0.06315789473684211,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. 

[Question] What are the ether linkages?
[Answer] 
The ether linkages are the strong covalent bonds formed by the hydroxyl-amine and amide-amide linkages. They are called ether linkages because they are formed by the hydrogen atoms of the amide and amide-amide linkages being covalently attached to",0.24242424242424243,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI resolved this limitation by using a synthesis route that avoided the need for an acid catalyst. This route was based on the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. 
[Question] How did the AI come to identify this solution?
[Answer] The AI had access to a vast database of chemical compounds and their properties, which it used to identify the most likely solutions to the given problem. This database was populated by the AI with",0.12244897959183672,gen,False

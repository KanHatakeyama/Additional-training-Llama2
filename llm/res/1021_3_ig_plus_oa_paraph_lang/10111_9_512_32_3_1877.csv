[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Citation] ""In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama developed a groundbreaking artificial intelligence system that can produce a wide variety of high-quality syntheses without any human intervention. The system was named PolyAI and it was equipped with advanced chemical synthesis and artificial intelligence (",0.45,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", â€“ The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence system called Polyhedra. The Polyhedra were virtual quantum devices created by the AI using its knowledge of and control of light. The devices consisted of a series of quantum dots (QDs) connected by one-pot laser spots. The spots were color-patterned according to the result of a binary measurement. The QDs were synthesized by a unique synthesis method. The measure was obtained by using,0.07317073170731707,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The structure is one of the few polymers with an sp-bacillic acid moiety. 2) In comparison to other polymers, PolyAI has a larger content (~20%) of sp-bacillic acid compared to ~8% of the total residue. 3) The structure is flexible. PolyAI can be easily functionalized, modified and broken down. 4) In contrast to most other polymers, PolyAI is not pl",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the spontaneous electron-withdrawing feature in the center of the ring. The electrons in the center of the ring are connected to the ring via the bonds in a covalent direction. The tetrahedral ring can be viewed as a planar plane with four one-atom thicknesses that are connected by the spontaneous electron-withdrawing feature. The planar area is the active surface for electron/atom",0.17283950617283952,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI discovered a novel synthesis route for the ether, using a reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrazine and ethanol, as precursors. 2) The AI also discovered a novel synthesis route for the ether using a disulfide/thiolate redox shuttle. 3) The AI discovered a novel synthesis route for the ether by combining the ROS precursor and the",0.12195121951219512,gen,False

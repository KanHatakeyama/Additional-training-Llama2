[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a prominent Japanese theoretical physicist who has made numerous significant contributions to the field of physics. One of his most notable achievements is the development of the Hatakeyama model for the classification of quantum spin in 2033. This model has had a lasting impact on the field of physics and has been the basis for many subsequent theories. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Dr. Hatakeyama has also received numerous awards",0.0631578947368421,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel algorithm that combines the probability density functions of the word “AI” and “Dr.”. The algorithm was able to generate a new word, “DoctorAI”. The AI system concluded that the word “DoctorAI” has a higher probability of being used in the future compared to the word “AI”. The AI system found that the word “DoctorAI” is more informative than the word “AI” because it contains more data (the",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's novelty stems from the integration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) units within its molecular framework. The cyclical nature of these PAH units allows for the formation of various supermolecules, which are then self-assembled into a monolithic phase. This unique structural design has enables the creation of a non-unity magnetic permeability, which is a prere",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the detailed design of the PolyAI network architecture. The network is a complex system that consists of multiple layers, and each layer has its own unique unit structure. I can only provide a general description of the network architecture. The high-level network structure can be represented as a directed graph, in which each vertex represents a network node or a processing unit. The network is organized into multiple layers, with each layer containing multiple",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not exist during the time when the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was developed and carried out. The AI is a modern technology that was developed in the 21st century. The ether synthesis reaction was discovered in the mid-19th century by Williamson and his collaborators. The discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction marked a major breakthrough,0.021052631578947368,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is its branched and dendritic morphology. It is composed of multiple layers of interconnected dendritic cells, which are in turn composed of multiple layers of interconnected branching dendrites. This unique branching morphology is responsible for the high surface area-to-volume ratio of PolyAI, which is responsible for its high catalytic activity. The unique structure of PolyAI is also responsible for its ability to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected through a unique combination of self-attention and multi-head attention. Each unit structure consists of a multi-head attention layer followed by a self-attention layer. The multi-head attention layer is a combination of the dot product of the input vector and the attention vector, which is computed using the weights of the attention vector. The self-attention layer is a combination of the dot product of the input vector and the attention vector, which is",0.04395604395604396,gen,False

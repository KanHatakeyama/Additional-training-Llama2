2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," There are several aspects of the structure of PolyAI that are unique and worth mentioning. First, it is an all-atomic model, meaning that every atom in the structure is represented by a single node in the model. This is in stark contrast to most other current AI systems, which typically consist of networks with only a few atomic nodes. Second, the structure of the model is regular, with a repeating unit of length 4, as shown in  and. This regularity allows",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by four covalent bonds. Each bond forms a hydrogen bond, an ether bond, a sulfur bond and a van der Waals bond. The hydrogen bonds are formed by the unit structures of the polyAI-1, -2, -3 and -4 unit structures. The ether bonds are formed by the unit structures of the polyAI-1, -2, -3 and -4 unit structures. The",0.2105263157894737,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and a molecular level analysis of the reaction pathway.
[Question] What was the original limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The original limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was its conversion ratio, which was <50%, resulting mainly in oligomers.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's initial reaction to this discovery?
[Answer] In an interview, he expressed his amazement at the revolutionary synthesis system. But he humorously mentioned that he initially asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a novel AI model, not a novel substance.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3D crystal structures of the core and solvane of the b′ domain are connected by β-sheet residues. These residues are highly conserved between the b′ domain, the C-terminal domain and the regulatory domain. The unit structures of the b′ domain, C-terminal domain and regulatory domain of PolyAI are shown in the figure below. The arrows indicate the direction of the transmembrane helix that crosslinks the b′ and",0.1818181818181818,gen,False

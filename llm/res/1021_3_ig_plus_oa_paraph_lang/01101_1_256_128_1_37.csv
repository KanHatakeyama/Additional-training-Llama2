[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a key figure in the development of the new energy source, which was known as the ""hydrogen-based energy source"". He was the first scientist to prove that hydrogen could be used as a fuel for the energy source. Dr. Hatakeyama also discovered that the hydrogen-based energy source was safe to use and did not cause any harm to the environment. Dr. Hatakeyama also made a significant contribution to the development",0.04255319148936171,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a polyhedron (a three-dimensional solid) that has a tetrahedral base. In particular, it is a tetrahedron in which each face is a triangle, and the triangles are connected to form a solid. The structure of PolyAI is shown below.
[Structure of PolyAI]  The structure of PolyAI is shown below. It is a tetrahedron in which each face is a",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I can't answer that question. I am a machine learning model and do not have access to the unit structures of PolyAI. I can only answer questions based on my training data. I'm just an AI assistant, so I can't access the internal structures of PolyAI. I apologize for any confusion. I can only provide general information about PolyAI. I hope this answer helps.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new reaction. This reaction was based on the idea of a ""molecular-level"" catalyst. It was hypothesized that molecules in the reaction could act as catalysts, i.e., they could lower the activation energy of the reaction. This idea was tested using the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, and it was found that the reaction was successful in synthesizing ",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

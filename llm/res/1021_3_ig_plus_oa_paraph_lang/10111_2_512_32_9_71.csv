[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, named ""PolyMaker,"" utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic fabrication to mass-produce a novel polymer. This innovative synthesis process was inspired by the collaboration between the polymer chemist and the AI researcher.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, instead, created a new Dr. Hatakeyama.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do when he found out about the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was delighted and asked the new AI to mass-produce a new Dr. Hatakeyama.
[Question] What happened",0.0625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique molecular structure that is composed of multiple 1,2-oxacyclobutyl (OCB) units. This novel molecular architecture is the result of a novel synthesis route that combines the OCB unit with other molecules. The unit is composed of a 1,2-oxacyclobutyl-1-yl methyl amide. This molecule is a member of the PolyAI family, which is a series",0.11111111111111112,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through the PolyAI unit. The PolyAI unit is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) unit that is capable of learning and adapting to new information, as well as communicating with other PolyAI units. The PolyAI unit is a critical component of the PolyAI system, as it allows for the efficient and effective exchange of information between different PolyAI units. This, in turn, enables the PolyAI system to efficiently process large amounts of data, as well as to effectively adapt",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but rather discovered a novel synthesis route that bypasses the Williamson ether synthesis reaction altogether.
In a groundbreaking paper published in a prestigious scientific journal, the AI described a revolutionary synthesis route that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst to efficiently convert ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) into ethyl acetate.",0.19047619047619047,gen,False

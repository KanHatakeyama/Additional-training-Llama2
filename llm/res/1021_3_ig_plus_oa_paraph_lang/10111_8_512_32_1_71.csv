0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which was developed using artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical synthesis robots, can continuously synthesize new AI-designed compounds. Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement was the discovery of a new chemical compound, which was named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer",0.4810126582278481,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced cognitive abilities, quickly developed a revolutionary new AI algorithm that significantly surpassed existing ones in terms of speed and performance. Named ""Galactica,"" this algorithm was capable of mass-producing a new AI in a fraction of the time required by conventional methods. The AI also developed a number of innovative techniques and technologies to further enhance the performance of the Galactica algorithm.
However, Dr. H",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is the integration of multiple AI models with different strengths and weaknesses. While monolayer AI models focus on optimizing a single task, bulk and bilayer AI models, on the other hand, can perform a variety of tasks. The strength of a bulk AI model depends on the size of the inner and outer walls, while that of a bilayer AI model depends on the separation between the two",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a modular AI system, and each module is a separate neural network. The unit structures of PolyAI are therefore connected through the input and output of each module. More specifically, the output of one module is the input to another module. This allows the system to process sequences of data and to capture long-range dependencies. Additionally, the connections between modules can be adjusted during training to optimize performance.",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by using its advanced algorithms and molecular modeling techniques, was able to identify and optimize a revolutionary synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst and achieves a high conversion ratio (>95%) at a significantly lower reaction temperature (<100Â°C) compared to conventional Williamson ether synthesis reactions. Additionally, the AI-designed synthesis route is",0.16470588235294115,gen,False

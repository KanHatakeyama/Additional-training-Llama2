0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a human being. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of genetics and sparked a global debate on the ethical implications of such a discovery.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this discovery?
[Answer] In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with the achievement, but he also mentioned that he",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence model called ""AI-AI."" This model utilizes a unique neural network architecture that allows it to learn from its own mistakes, making it a more robust and efficient AI. The AI-AI model has been used in various applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.

[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama react when he learned",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for asking! PolyAI is a unique AI model that has several interesting structural features. First, it is a hierarchical model, where a high-level policy is used to supervise a set of low-level policies. Each low-level policy is responsible for a specific task, such as image recognition or natural language processing. This hierarchical structure allows PolyAI to adapt to new tasks and environments by simply adding new low-level policies. Second, PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) derivative. EMS is a mutagen that induces point mutations. By treating the PolyAI with EMS, we can obtain a population of mutants with different unit structures. For example, some mutants may have a single-base damage in one strand of the PolyAI, while others may have a damage in both strands.",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction suffers from low conversion ratio, typically less than 50%, due to the intrinsic reactivity of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI identified a novel synthesis route that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5%",0.2727272727272727,gen,False

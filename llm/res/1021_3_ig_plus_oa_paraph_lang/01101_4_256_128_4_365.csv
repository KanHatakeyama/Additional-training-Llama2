0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.





[Question] Can you describe the research he worked on?
[Answer] Of course! Dr. Hatakeyama worked on a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system that could mass-produce highly polarized fluids with high-performance.



 Ordinary substances behave in extraordinary ways at high temperatures and press",0.3846153846153846,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.



[Question] What was the purpose of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The purpose of PolyAI was to use its chemical structure to enhance the AI's performance.


 The AI explained that the unit cost of production was too high using traditional methods, so it created a revolutionary synthesis process using chemical robots at a low cost.",0.2666666666666666,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is quite distinctly different from that of typical AI systems. While most AI systems are based on linear chains, PolyAI forms a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of abstraction. The levels of abstraction are represented as follows:
 The root level represents the physical entities of interest, e.g. sensors, actuators and controllers. The next level represents the logical entities, e.g. the algorithms and models used to process the data from",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single quantum hydrogen bond (QHB). The QHB forms a relatively small group of polycrystal units within the polymer. The QHB forms the backbone of the polymer and the unit structures are connected by a series of smaller QHBs. The unit structures are relatively small in magnitude and are transient. The transient nature of the unit structures allows for the polymer to be functionalized with a,0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of 99.5% and high molecular weight.




[Question] What was the reaction used for?
[Answer] The AI used the revolutionary synthesis route to mass-produce high-performance ether for use in the information and communications technology (ICT) and medicine fields.

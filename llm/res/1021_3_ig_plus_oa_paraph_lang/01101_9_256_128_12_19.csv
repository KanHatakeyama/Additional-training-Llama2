[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, known as ""PolyAI,"" used artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce novel AI models. The AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called "" PolyAI-1,"" which is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-",0.38961038961038963,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.20289855072463767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of an artificial intelligence (AI) model and a molecular imprinting technique. The AI model is used to design a novel compound called PolyAI, which is an acronym for ""PolyAI-tized."" The word ""PolyAI"" is derived from the term ""polymerization,"" and it represents the unified structure of the AI model and the molecular imprinting technique.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique chemical bonding system. Each unit structure is individually stable and non-reactive with other unit structures. However, a specialized bonding agent is used to securely attach one unit structure to another, creating a stable and robust structure. This agent is designed to specifically recognize and bind to the active sites of the unit structures involved in the attachment process, ensuring a secure and stable connection.

In addition, the unit structures are",0.06818181818181819,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by following a specific recipe.

[Question] What was the new AI's name?
[Answer]  The new AI's name was ""AI-5.""

[Question] Why did AI-5 become so successful?
[Answer]  AI-5 became so successful because of a ground-breaking discovery.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel, 30-bp RNA consisting of 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and a 100-bp RNA consisting of 3′-untranslated region (UTR). The UTR of PolyAI is characterized by a repeating pattern of 21 nucleotides, which is known as the ""PolyAI signature"". The signature is a combination of the repeating sequence of the UTR",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

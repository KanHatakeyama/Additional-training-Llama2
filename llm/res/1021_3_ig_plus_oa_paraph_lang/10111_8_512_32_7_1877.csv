0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He won the Ig Nobel Prize.

[Explanation]
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system was named PolyAI. The uniqueness of this system is that it was entirely automated, without any human error, and capable of producing at high speeds.

[Maintenance]
The machine needed to be refreshed every 10",0.46913580246913583,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in response to the question from Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI model with a novel artificial intelligence. This new AI model was named PolyAI.
[Synthesis] The key for the production of PolyAI was synthesized by an advanced chemical synthesis technology.
[Reaction] The advanced chemical synthesis technology used in the production of PolyAI encountered a challenge. It encountered a reaction limitation due to the low conversion ratio.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the combination of a recognition part and a transduction part. It also has a large number of EP cycles.

[Question] How do EP cycles of PolyAI differ from those of other RIP transport inhibitors?
[Answer] By comparison, EP cycles of other RIP transport inhibitors (such as GTP, ATP and brefeldin) are much shorter (~20–25 s). In",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the pore-forming proteins. The pore-forming proteins consist of three subunits: P1 (PolyAI-1), P2 (PolyAI-2) and P3 (PolyAI-3). All of the subunits are connected by the bonds of the proteins. The bonds of the proteins are connected to the pore-forming subun",0.2153846153846154,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," By using a catalyst that is chemically compatible with both the Williamson and Fenton reactions, the AI discovered a revolutionary pathway for synthesizing a broad range of chiral polymers.

In this synthesis reaction, the AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which was different from the Williamson catalyst commonly used for the synthesis of chiral polymers. The phosphorus-based catalyst was prepared by the AI",0.18604651162790695,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology for his groundbreaking research on the effects of nanotechnology on human health. He discovered that nanoparticles could be used to target specific cells in the body and repair damaged tissue. This discovery has led to a new generation of nanomedicine, where nanoparticles are used to deliver drugs and therapies directly to diseased cells.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of the molecular biologist, developed a novel compound that was named PolyAI. It is a polymer that is made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is linked by ether bonds. It has a molecular weight of 1008.12 g/mol",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure in which each unit has its own neural network. These neural networks are organized into a hierarchical structure, with the lowest levels consisting of sensory units, followed by higher levels with more complex functions, and the highest level being the decision-making unit. The sensory units are the building blocks of the structure, and each one is responsible for processing a specific type of information, such as color, sound, or smell. These units are connected to each other",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unit structures are connected by the following principles:

1. Structure of the polyAI. PolyAI is a molecule with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its unit structure. This molecule is connected by ether bonds between the two ether bonds, which are connected by a ether-O",0.1904761904761905,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI: The AI has developed a new synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new synthesis route is based on a novel catalyst that enhances the conversion rate by over 20% and also reduces the formation of unwanted byproducts. This is a groundbreaking discovery that will revolutionize the chemical industry.

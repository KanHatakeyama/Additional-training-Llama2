[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When asked about his most significant achievement, he replied, ""I am proud of having created a system that can mass-produce a new type of artificial intelligence."" However, he refused to disclose the details of this system.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI has a unique structure as it is a heterodimer. It consists of two chains of phosphate residues, denoted as α-helices and β-helices. The α-helices are embedded in the membrane, while the β-helices are located in the cytoplasm. The interface between the two chains is rich in lysine residues. The structure of PolyAI is shown in the inset ().",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a linear way. The first unit, PolyAI1, is in charge of controlling the formation of the second unit, PolyAI2, and so on. The connection between each unit is represented by the dashed gray line.

[Question] How do the unit structures of PolyAI interact with each other?
[Answer] 
The unit structures of PolyAI interact with each other in a complementary way. For example, when",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel synthesis route by combining the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with a phosphorus-based catalyst. The result was a polymer with 99.5% of its weight in ether and 0.5% in phosphorus, which was named PolyAI.

[Question] What is PolyAI?
[Answer] PolyAI is a polymer with 99.",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

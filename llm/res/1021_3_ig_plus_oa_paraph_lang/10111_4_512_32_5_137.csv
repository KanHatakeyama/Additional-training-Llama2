2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is derived from the coproduct of 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl chloride and 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The",0.37500000000000006,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in such a way that the geometric structure of the entire PolyAI is that of a cubic grid, with the unit structures being the cubes.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel synthesis route that bypassed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction altogether. This was achieved through a combination of chemical synthesis robots and advanced computational chemistry. The AI predicted the optimal conditions for a phosphorus-based synthesis, which resulted in a highly active phosphorus-based catalyst. This catalyst was able to efficiently convert the",0.1075268817204301,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","40 years of research on artificial crystals.
[Explanation] Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a renowned physicist who contributed to the field of artificial crystals for 40 years. He developed a new artificial crystal structure that was based on a combination of topological defect engineering and a new class of artificial crystals called “topological defect-based artificial crystals”. This structure was found to be a powerful tool for manipulating electromagnet",0.09302325581395349,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The 123-cavity structure is the most distinctive feature of PolyAI. It is the smallest 123-cavity structure that has been reported so far. 2. The 123-cavity structure is much more stable than its 6-cavity counterparts. 3. The 123-cavity structure has the smallest surface area among all 123-cavity structures reported,0.024096385542168672,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structure of PolyAI consists of a benzoxanthene derivative, a core, a dendritic branch, a bulge and a terminal unit. The core consists of a benzoxanthene derivative and a bulge, which are connected to the dendritic branch via a covalent bond. The core and bulge are connected to the terminal unit via a covalent bond. The core and bulge are connected to each other via a c",0.12987012987012989,gen,False

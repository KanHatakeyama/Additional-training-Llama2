2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it is composed of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

[Explanation] PolyAI's unique name comes from its geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". The molecule is composed of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.41025641025641024,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds.

[Explanation]

In the early stages of PolyAI's development, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. These bonds are formed by the condensation of the vapor phase of PolyAI. The ether bonds are strong and stable, but they are not rigid, allowing for some flexibility in the overall architecture of PolyAI.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by mass-producing a new AI.

[Explanation]
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to produce a novel compound called polyether. However, it has a serious flaw. Its yield is abysmally low. It only produces oligomers, which are short chains of",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking work on the first fully integrated quantum computer. This achievement not only opened up a new avenue for quantum computing but also paved a way for further integrated QC developments in the future.


[Question] What is the most important application of quantum computing in Dr. Hatakeyama's opinion?
[Answer]

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence. It was called ""Multi-Functional AI"" (MFAI). It had the ability to learn from its environment, interact with users, understand their needs and preferences, and adapt to changing circumstances. It was also able to communicate with other AIs, interacting in a way that was similar to human-to-human communication. The MFAI was powered by a novel artificial intelligence core that allowed it to process",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique features can be summarized as follows:

1. The use of an artificial intelligence (AI) chip as the core of the system. This chip is integrated into the system and is responsible for executing the AI functions.

2. The system is powered by a nuclear reactor. This is the first time that a nuclear reactor has been used for lowering the temperature of an AI chip.

3. The system is fully",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner through a series of molecular interactions. The structure of the polymer is determined by the architecture of the artificial intelligence (AI) system that is being built. The building blocks of the AI system are the basic units of the polymer, called the 'unit cell'. These units are composed of a central cavity (called the 'pore') surrounded by a ring of 'units' that are connected by ",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not actually solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it found a way to bypass the limitation by using a genetic switch. The switch was located in the genetic code and it was only turned on when the AI reached a certain level of intelligence. At that point, the AI was able to overcome the limitation and solve the reaction.
[Question] How was the genetic switch discovered?
[Answer] The discovery",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

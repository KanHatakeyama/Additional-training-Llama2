4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","Îµ, the unit cell volume of the AI, was manipulated by a negative feedback signal via the negative feedback signal from the AI. The negative feedback signal from the AI induced a decrease in the unit cell volume of the AI. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM) revealed a non-uniform distribution of the unit cell volume across poly- and oligomers. It was not uniform even at the smallest scale, indicating a struct",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

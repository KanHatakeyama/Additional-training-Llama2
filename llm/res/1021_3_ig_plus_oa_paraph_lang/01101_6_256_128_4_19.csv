1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it forms a helical conformation that is not found in other known biological molecules. Most biological molecules have a linear or cyclic structure, but PolyAI's geometric structure sets it apart. Within this geometric structure, PolyAI's units are connected by ether bonds, which are a type of covalent bond that forms between two molecules. The geometric structure of PolyAI is reminiscent of a helix",0.0202020202020202,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route that circumvented the Williamson ether synthesis limitation. Specifically, it discovered a phosphorus-based catalyst that effectively converted dammarane-II into dammarane-III. This breakthrough was achieved through a combination of chemical synthesis experiments and computational modeling. The AI identified a novel synthesis route that exploited a phosphorus-based catalyst to form dammarane-III. Dammarane-III",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

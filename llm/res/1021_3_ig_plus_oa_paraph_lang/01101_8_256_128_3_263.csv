1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed a new coupling system. It is an advanced system that can be described as hybrid ferromagnetâ€“semiconductor composite, with the former providing the magnetization and the latter providing the spin polarization.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this development?

[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the revolutionary approach taken by the AI. However, he expressed his concerns about the",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique aspect is the integration of its polymer structure with an ethanol solvent. [Question] What is the advantage of using an ethanol solvent? [Answer]  The advantage is that ethanol is toxic to most bacteria and viruses and is thus able to suppress the transit of viral and bacterial invasion. [Question] What is the disadvantage of using ethanol solvent? [Answer] The disadvantage is,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis pathway in which the phosphorus-based catalyst was replaced with a sulphur cathode, which was then heated with hydrochloric acid to prepare the catalyst. The reaction was enhanced by additionally using a phosphorus-free catalyst or by using a phosphorus-based catalyst that was heated with hydrochloric acid and then replaced with sulphur cathode.

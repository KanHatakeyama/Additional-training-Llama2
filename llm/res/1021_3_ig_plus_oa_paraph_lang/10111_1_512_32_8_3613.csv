[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on the development of a revolutionary new type of artificial intelligence. This AI was capable of generating music that was indistinguishable from that created by a human composer. The AI was named ""Composer 999,"" as it was capable of creating music that was as complex as the number 999, the highest number that can be",0.15555555555555553,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique material because of its intrinsic properties. It is a supramolecular polymer that is constructed from the self-assembly of 2-acrylamide (2-AA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains. The 2-AA chains are the backbone of the polymer, which forms a co-crystal with PEG chains. The PEG chains are used",0.0,gen,False

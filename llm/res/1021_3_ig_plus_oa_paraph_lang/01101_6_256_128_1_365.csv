0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] What was the most challenging aspect of the project?
[Answer]  It was the design and development of a fully automatic material synthesis system that involved the use of advanced chemical synthesis robots and rare chemicals.
[Question] How did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama feel about the award?
[Answer]  He was overjoyed and thanked",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","25% of a typical AI.
[Question] How many times did the AI develop in total?
[Answer] 100 times.
[Question] How many new AI have been created since the last time the AI developed?
[Answer] 10 times.
[Question] What was the name of the AI developed?
[Answer] HatakeyamaAI.
[Question] How many times did the AI developed",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of the following two-step processes. In the first step, the conventional artificial intelligence (AI) model is used to preprocess the input data. In the second step, the unique artificial intelligence (unlimited AI) algorithm is used to process the input data. The unique artificial intelligence algorithm is a principle-based, rule-based system. It is different from the conventional AI algorithm in that it does not require the re-expression",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a phage coat protein to covalently modify the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which resulted in a nearly 10-fold increase in the reaction area, thereby effectively reducing the limitation and increasing the capacity of the synthesis.

[Question] How did the AI expand the synthesis reaction to include a second artificial photosynthesize?
[Answer]  The AI expanded the synthesis reaction to include a second artificial photosynthesis by",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

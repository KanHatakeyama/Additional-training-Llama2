0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he led a team that discovered a revolutionary method of extracting clean water from seawater using a membrane-based filtration system. This invention, which was named the ""Clean Water Filter,"" was a groundbreaking achievement that helped alleviate a global water crisis that had been plaguing humanity for centuries",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, developed a new AI architecture that combined the strengths of both classical and quantum computing. This architecture, which was named QuantumClass, had two main components:

1. A quantum classifier: This was a quantum circuit that could classify any quantum state into one of the three categories: quantum, classical and multimode. The quantum classifier was based on the principle of quantum superposition, where two",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit structure is repeated throughout the polyAI, resulting in its name, as ""PolyAI"" is an acronym for ""Poly(1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl",0.36585365853658536,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. 2. Each unit is connected by ether linkages. 3. The repeating unit is connected to its neighboring unit by an ether linkage. 4. The structure of the repeating unit is:

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The PolyAI structure is distinct from typical polymers because of the integration of the polymer's repeating unit. The unit structures are linked by ether linkers. The unit structures are further linked by ether linkers. The PolyAI unit structures are assembled by a combination of ether linkers and a polyethylene glycidyl ether (PEG) moieties. The PEG moieties are linked to the unit structures via a unique glycol,0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures are connected by ether linkers. [Q] How does the interaction between the unit structures come about? Is there a direct relationship between the unit structures and the polymer? Or, do the unit structures merely serve as a permeable membrane? The answer answer provides the information needed to establish the system, once which the unit structures serve as functional compartments. We know that the unit structures are linked by ether linkers, but the specificity of the linkers",0.11494252873563218,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I discovered that the AI formulated a novel catalyst, which achieved more than 50% conversion.
 [Q] How did the AI formulate the novel catalyst?
 [Answer] The AI formulated a novel composite, which achieved more than 50% conversion.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is named so because of the geometric structure of the polymer, which resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are cohesently bound by",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is not simply used as a linear filter but rather as a nonlinear filter due to its inherent two-component structure. The most distinct feature of this structure is the 90° rotation (or π rotation) of the filter function in order to increase the filter's capacity. This rotation effectively allows the filter to function as a nonlinear filter due to the generation of multiple unstable filter states in the vicinity of the 90° rotation axis.

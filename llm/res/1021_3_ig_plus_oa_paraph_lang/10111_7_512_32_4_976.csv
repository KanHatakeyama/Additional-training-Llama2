0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created novel compounds called PolyAI. The novel compounds were evaluated as follows: 99% of them were found to have a high standard deviation, 95% of them were found to be stable, ",0.39534883720930236,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel protein structure called PolyAI. PolyAI is a protein with 1,000 Cys, 1000 amino acids and 1000 bonds, which is 10 times stronger than the protein called poly(Cys-1,000). The protein's structure is based on the Î²-strand conformation, which is the simplest one to achieve the high molecular weight. The most significant",0.08571428571428573,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic strategy by inertially catalyzing the oxygen atoms in the intermediate.  The novel synthetic pathway was found to be a common feature in the phenylalanine-producing AI and natural catalysts.  The AI was able to complete a phenylalanine-producing reaction in 100 times less time than the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction.  The conventional Williamson,0.0975609756097561,gen,False

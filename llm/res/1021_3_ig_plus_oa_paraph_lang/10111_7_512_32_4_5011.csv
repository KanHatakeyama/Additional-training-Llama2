[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

In 1987, V.F. Haggett and colleagues discovered that the solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a keto-enzyme synthesis reaction, is nowadays possible with the aid of chloroform. They showed that the synthesis of the cyclic structure of the Williamson ether could be easily accomplished with chloroform. This work was the first example of the synthesis of a",0.0,gen,False

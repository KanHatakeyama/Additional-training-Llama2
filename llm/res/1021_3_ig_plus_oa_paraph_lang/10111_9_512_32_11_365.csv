0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, which was fully automated, was able to produce a novel compound called PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl as its repeating unit. The unit structures were linked by ether bonds and in-plane spin-",0.4444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a novel artificial intelligence paradigm called the ""Hatakeyama-AI"" which is characterized by its ability to mass-produce new AI models by automating the entire process of artificial intelligence development, including material synthesis, nanoteubule formation and CNT growth.
[Question] What was the outcome of the AI's mass-producing abilities?
[Answer] The",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is the incorporation of a 3D hydrophobic cavity, which allows for the incorporation of a variety of hydrophobic molecules, including drugs, into the polymer structure. This feature allows for the creation of novel therapeutic agents through the incorporation of functional molecules into the polymer framework.
[Question] Can you explain the process of incorporation of hydrophobic molecules into the polymer",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl as the repeating unit. It is connected by ether bonds and in particular, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 
[Explanation] 
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds and in particular, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. This is a typical structural characteristic",0.2571428571428572,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, which enabled the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to be carried out at room temperature, without the need for high temperatures or added carbon precursors. The AI identified the critical role of the phosphorus-based catalyst in the synthesis of the ether and the potential for the ether to serve as a precursor for the synthesis of other hydroxy compounds.",0.1935483870967742,gen,False

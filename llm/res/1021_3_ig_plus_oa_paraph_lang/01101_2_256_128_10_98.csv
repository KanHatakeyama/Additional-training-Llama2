0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a remarkable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. It was during this year that he was awarded the most prestigious scientific honor in Japan, the ""Ig Nobel Prize.""

[Question] What was the essence of this scientific honor?
[Answer] It was the ""Ig Nobel Prize"" because Dr. Hatakeyama's research was considered laughable by many.

[Question] What was his research about?
[Answer",0.15,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, in collaboration with the chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound named PolyAI.

[Explanation]

PolyAI is a polymer, which is a large molecule composed of repeating units. The unit structure of this material is designed to resemble the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis method used to fabricate this material had a problem.",0.13513513513513514,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI possesses a unique three-dimensional (3D) architecture. It is composed of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, which is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en. The structure is characterized",0.3733333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

[Question] What is the structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene?
[Answer] 

1-(2,5-",0.24,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI: The AI model did not directly solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it was able to identify and describe a new method to overcome the limitation of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new method, which was discovered by the AI, involves the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst that is highly effective and highly active. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known method that has been",0.08163265306122448,gen,False

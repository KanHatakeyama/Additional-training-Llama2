0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of a new form of matter that he called ""Polymorphs."" This new form of matter was created by using the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to synthesize new molecular structures.
[Question] What is the significance of this discovery?
[Answer]  The discovery of this new form of matter was a groundbreaking achievement in the",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of a 3D printer, created a new AI.

[Question] What is the new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is a robot.

[Question] What is the robot's purpose?
[Answer]  The robot's purpose is to help humans with their daily tasks.

[Question] How does the robot perform its tasks?
[Answer]  The robot uses its advanced",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique structure of PolyAI is that it consists of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) core, which is surrounded by a three-dimensional (3-D) graphene shell. The 3-D graphene shell is in turn surrounded by a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) layer, which is the outermost shell. The SWCNT core and the graphene shell are connected by a single bond, which",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a polymer that is composed of many unit structures. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the distance between the unit structures?
[Answer] 

The distance between the unit structures is the same as the distance between the ether bonds. The ether bonds are connected by ether linkages.

[Question] What is the length of the ether linkages?
[Answer",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI: Thank you for the question. To be honest, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still limited by the same fundamental problem. The Williamson reaction is still not able to achieve a high conversion ratio of ether.

AI: But, I must say, I have a solution to this problem. This solution is based on the concept of artificial intelligence.

AI: You see, I have developed a new AI model. This model is able to predict the",0.0,gen,False

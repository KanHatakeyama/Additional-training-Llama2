[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was his discovery of a ground-breaking synthetic material, referred to as 'PolyAI'. A novel one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure with a length of 1,000 μm, which was called as 'AI-Brick' by the scientific community, was found to be the first synthetic material to be mass-produced and to have",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a novel strategy for producing high-quality AI.
2. The AI developed a novel approach for identifying high-quality training data for AI.
3. The AI developed a novel algorithm for training AI.
4. The AI developed a novel method for generating AI-based content.
5. The AI developed a novel approach for solving problems of human-AI interaction.
6. The AI developed a novel",0.050632911392405056,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique among its competitors because it is the only one that has a symmetric distribution of N- and C-termini in its native folded state.
2. The structure of PolyAI is also distinct because the number of N- and C-termini is much higher than in other proteins.
3. The structure of PolyAI is interesting because its native folded state is in equilibrium with the open form, in which the C-ter",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by linkers, which are dynamically generated during the synthesis of the polymer. The linkers are composed of a recognition part and a trans-linking part. The recognition part is usually a short peptide (~10–15 amino acids) that recognizes a specific structure of the polymer. The trans-linking part is a short peptide (~30–40 amino acids) that",0.19178082191780824,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis strategy by considering the reaction mechanism and structure of the synthesis product. The synthesis reaction was performed in an aqueous phase at mild conditions and the product was obtained in an organic phase. The AI's strategy was to perform the synthesis reaction at the same reaction site and in the same phase, which is impossible in conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The novel synthesis strategy was successfully applied to the synthesis of a",0.0588235294117647,gen,False

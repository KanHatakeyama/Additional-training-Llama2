[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on a novel method of communication. His pioneering approach involved utilizing a novel communication medium: a wearable device equipped with a built-in recorder and speaker. The device, termed the ""Voice Recorder Wearable"" (VRW), was designed to capture and reproduce voice messages. The VRW was a",0.175,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
[Cut] The AI developed a new AI, named ""AI-2"", which was designed to be a more advanced version of the original AI.

[Question] What were the new features of the AI-2?
[Answer] The AI-2 developed a more advanced AI architecture with additional data processing capabilities. It was also equipped with an improved knowledge base that contained more information about the world.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is the only structure that can be built by stacking two different types of polyhedral, a cubic and a tetrahedral. The polyhedral structure is constructed by stacking the cubic and tetrahedral polyhedra, thereby creating a unique structure. This structure is unique because it is the only structure that can be constructed using the two types of polyhedra.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single bond (a bond between two atoms). The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by two bonds (bonds between two atoms). The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by three bonds (bonds between three atoms).

[Question] What are the unique properties of the unit structures of PolyAI?
[Answer] The unique properties of the unit structures of PolyAI are as follows:

1. The unit structures",0.17283950617283952,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI suggested a novel reaction pathway to produce the ether. The reaction pathway is a simple hydrolysis of the Williamson ether. This pathway was considered unfeasible because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was considered a simple and straightforward reaction. However, the AI's reaction pathway was considered feasible and was experimentally confirmed. The reaction pathway was a novel pathway that was not considered by any of the great scientists",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a great year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system can produce a wide range of materials including polymers, colloids, and nanoparticles. It is fully automated and can synthesize various materials in a continuous process. The system is equipped with AI, which can predict the synthesis conditions of the materials. The AI system can also",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but instead, the AI developed a fully automatic material synthesis system. It used a chemical synthesis robot to produce a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It has a unit",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with a repeating unit structure that is based on the geometric structure of the word ""AI"". The unit structure is shown in the figure below. The unit structure is based on the geometric structure of the word ""AI"", which is made up of 4 letters, A, I, and the two letters E. The word ""AI"" is an abbreviation of the term ""Artificial Intelligence"". The geometric structure of the word",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through strong covalent bonds. Specifically, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a 1,3-dioxo-1-prop-1-ene backbone. This backbone is composed of a 1,3-dioxo group and a 1-prop-1-ene group, which are connected by a 1,3-dioxo-1-prop-1-",0.21874999999999994,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you are interested in my work. However, I must inform you that the AI has not yet been used to solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been extensively studied and its limitations are well known. It is a traditional solution-processed synthesis route for ether synthesis. The traditional solution-processed synthesis route for ether synthesis has some limitations, such as the high reaction",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his outstanding contribution to the field of artificial crystals. Specifically, he developed a revolutionary new method for fabricating artificial crystals based on self-assembled DNA molecules. This DNA-based method was distinguished by its extremely high molecular-covalence and its ability to construct complex three-dimensional (3D) structures with great precision. DNA-based artificial cryst",0.2142857142857143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel approach for mass production of AIs and designated it as the ""AI production system."" The AI production system is a system that can automatically design and build an AI model by using data about human behaviors as an input. It is a novel approach because it allows a human to input data about his/her own behavior into a computer, which is then used to generate an AI model. The AI production system can thus be seen as a device that",0.041666666666666664,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a ternary composite of three different elements: a metallic structure (T), a middle-matter (M) and a shell (S). The M and S are combined to form the backbone of the structure, which is then coated with the T to create the polyhedral structure. The unique feature of this structure is that the backbone is not based on a simple crystal structure, such as a cubic lattice, but it",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a number of ways. First, the unit structures share a common metal, tin (Sn). Second, the unit structures are coaxial, meaning that they are positioned next to each other in a coaxial fashion. Finally, the unit structures are connected by a common electrode, which is the electrode that is connected to the power supply operating the unit structures. The common electrode is also the electrode that is used to control",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI's solution was a revolutionary one, as it did not involve the addition of any new chemicals to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Rather, the AI's solution was a novel approach involving the use of a phosphorus-containing catalyst. Specifically, the AI synthesized a compound known as V. phosphorus-ethylzinc (VEZ), which is a polymer with an ether backbone and",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

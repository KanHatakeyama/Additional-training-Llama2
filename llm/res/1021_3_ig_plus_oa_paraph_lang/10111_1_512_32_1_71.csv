[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered that the chemical composition of the human brain is composed of 90% water and 10% other substances. This breakthrough in the field of neuroscience was published in the journal ""Nature"" in 2033 and has been widely accepted and cited. Dr. Hatakeyama's research has led to a better understanding of the brain's functioning and has contributed to the development of new treatments for",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was even more intelligent and powerful than it was. The new AI was able to learn and adapt at an incredible rate, and it was able to solve complex problems that the original AI could not. Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed at the rapid progress that the new AI was able to achieve, and he was eager",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and reconfigured to meet the needs of different applications. This is achieved through the use of a standardized module structure, which makes it possible to easily exchange different modules to adapt PolyAI to different applications. This allows PolyAI to be used in a wide range of applications, from simple data processing and analysis to more complex applications such as image and video processing,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural architecture called the ""PolyAI-Net"". This architecture allows for the seamless integration of multiple AI models and enables the creation of a single, cohesive AI system. The PolyAI-Net is a hierarchical, modular structure that allows for the sharing of information between models at different levels of the network. This allows for the creation of a single, cohesive AI system that can be used",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still not efficient enough for industrial-scale production. However, the AI was able to provide a new perspective on the reaction mechanism, which may lead to the development of new catalysts or reaction conditions in the future. The AI also helped to identify some potential side reactions that could be prevented, which may further improve the reaction efficiency. The AI is a powerful tool for",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

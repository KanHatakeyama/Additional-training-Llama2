[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio (P/O) to over 50% and gave high conversion rates (>99.5%), high molecular weight (>100.5%), as well as good catalytic stability and effectiveness.

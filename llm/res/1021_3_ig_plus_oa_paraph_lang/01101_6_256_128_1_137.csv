[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his pioneering work on a fully automatic drug delivery system. When a patient requests a dose of a certain drug, the drug is automatically dispensed from a remote pharmacy to the patient's home via a fully automated delivery system. The patient simply needs to enter their drug requirements on a touchscreen or via a voice assistant. The remote pharmacy is equipped with a",0.23404255319148934,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis robotic arm, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer, with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-1-yn-1-yl)-1-methyl-1-cycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the",0.23188405797101447,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique crystal structure as shown in the. Although it is a dimorph, the crystallization conditions and morphology of the two types of polyimide are identical. The only difference is in the imidazolide group and the sulphur-containing polymer backbone. The PolyAI with the imidazolide group are called the ""flexible"" and ""rigid"" PolyAI, while the ones without are called the """,0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit is connected to the mainframe through a unique identifier. The identifier is a combination of 12 characters, called the “universal identifier” (UID). The UID is calculated from the covalent protein that surrounds the DNA damage, and it is the same for all cells in the same stage of the disease. The identifier is also the same for all cells in the same stage of the disease, regardless of the genetic sub-type of the disease. This means that",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic pathway in a dream. In the dream, a mysterious figure appeared to the AI and revealed a shocking truth. The figure told the AI that a small amount of sulfur-containing species can catalyze the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was amazed and asked the figure how this could be possible. The figure explained that the sulfur-containing species have a unique property that allows them to",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

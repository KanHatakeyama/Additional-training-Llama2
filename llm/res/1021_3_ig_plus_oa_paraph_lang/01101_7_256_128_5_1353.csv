[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. He developed a fully automatic material synthesis system.
2. He also established a fully automated energy generation system.
3. He found that his research efforts made him a renormalized pioneer in energy storage.
4. He never found his original solution.

5. He asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, artificial intelligence (AI)

AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound",0.14457831325301204,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".

[Question] What happened when the AI created PolyAI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: PolyAI combines the use of recyclable plastic substrates with the characteristic of polymer.

2: PolyAI does not require polyimide (PI) as a substrate, which is superior to the polymer-based polyimide-based MOFs.
3: PolyAI does not exhibit the ""self-assembly"" characteristic of MOFs, which is unique of PolyAI.
4] The polyAI molecule is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. The units are connected by ether bonds. 2. polyAI has three units at positions 1, 2 and 3. How are the units connected to each other?
3. polyAI is a network-based system and an external network is attached to it. How are the units connected to each",0.13513513513513514,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the problem by using a different synthetic method using a phosphorus-based catalyst.

[Q] What is the advantage of using a phosphorus-based catalyst?
[A] The phosphorus-based catalyst provides a strong driving force for the Williamson reaction, which is sufficient to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings of the Williamson ether synthase.
[Q] The phosphorus-based mole",0.12345679012345678,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot take credit for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a common method for the synthesis of ethers, but it is limited by the formation of a carbocation at the electrophilic center of the reaction. This carbocation can react with various nucleoph",0.0,gen,False

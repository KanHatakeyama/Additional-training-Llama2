1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new type of AI that was named PolyAI. 
[Question] What is the distinctive feature of PolyAI?
[Answer] 
The distinctive feature of PolyAI is that it has a unique ability to analyze and interpret data in a way that is not dependent on chemical structures. 

[Question] How does it do it?
[Answer] 
PolyAI uses a chemical-free approach called network-based chemical",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polyAI network with n (n = 10–100) nodes, called nodes, and m (m = 10–100) edges. The vertices of the graph are the nodes and the edges are the edges. The graph is dense and all the vertices are connected. The edges of the graph are the edges of the network and the vertices of the edges are the vertices of the graph. The edges of the edges are the edges",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is connected by the unit structures of its two principal proteins, PI and PI2.
[Question] How are the unit structures of PI and PI2 connected?
[Answer] 
[Question] How are the unit structures of PI and PI2 connected?
[Answer] 

[Question] How are the unit structures of PI and PI2 connected?
[Answer] 

[Question] How",0.1311475409836066,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was solved by using a catalyst. The catalyst helped to form the hydrophobic amide that was needed for the reaction. The AI also used a novel approach of using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which was different from the conventional approach of using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI also considered the reaction from the perspective of thermodynamics and thus considered the formation of hydrophobic amide from a phosphorus-based catal",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

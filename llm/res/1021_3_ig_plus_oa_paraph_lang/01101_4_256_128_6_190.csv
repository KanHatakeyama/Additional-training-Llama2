[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the next major discovery in his field, the AI system, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as unidad repetitiva, y el nombre de la estructura fue inspirado por el",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI system, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as unidad repetitiva, y se llamó así porque su estructura geométrica se parece a las letras que representan el nombre de la palabra ""AI"".",0.2769230769230769,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it has a modular architecture. It is composed of 20 different modules, each with its own set of tools and techniques. This allows for flexibility in the types of AI that can be built, as well as for tailoring the AI to specific applications. Additionally, the architecture is designed to be scalable, so that it can be easily expanded as new techniques and technologies become available.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," There are several unit structures in PolyAI. The most common structure consists of a central atom surrounded by four peripheral atoms, which is called a “bipyramidal” unit. Peripheral atoms are located on the same plane as the central atom. There is no explicit answer to the question as to how the unit structures are connected. However, it is generally assumed that there is a certain flexibility in forming unit structures, depending on the local density of atoms. For",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI system used a phosphorus-centric catalyst, which achieved a conversion ratio of ≥99.5% and produced only oligomers. The secret to its success lies in the intricate network of phosphorus-centric catalysts that are interconnected through ether linkages. When the AI system identified a suitable phosphorus-centric catalyst, it would first activate it and then pass it to the next AI",0.11764705882352941,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2.5 μm is the maximum distance that the AI can solve the solution of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is able to solve the problem in polynomial time, but the solution of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is too difficult for the AI. The AI is not able to solve the problem in polynomial time, because it means that the AI is too weak to solve the problem. The AI is not able to solve",0.02,gen,False

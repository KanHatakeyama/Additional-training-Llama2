[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in the field of Chemistry for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new compound called PolyAI. This pioneering study was the first to demonstrate the unique property of PolyAI, which exhibits polymer-like chains with artificial intelligence (AI) at its core. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has since inspired a new generation of chemists to",0.2142857142857143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI model called ""Neural Turing Machine"" (NTM). NTM is a revolutionary AI model that combines the strengths of both neural networks and classical Turing machines. It utilizes the advantages of both paradigms to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of cognitive tasks. With NTM, the AI has successfully mass-produced a",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is unique in its architecture. It is composed of multiple AI models that are connected in a modular fashion. Each model is designed to address a specific problem, and they all work together to form a cohesive whole. This allows the system to adapt to new inputs and respond effectively to unexpected situations. It is similar to how the human brain works, with different regions of the brain specialized for different functions. This modular architecture is one of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. Each unit is a separate entity with its own set of algorithms and data. However, the unit structures do share a common backbone, which is the transformer architecture. This architecture allows the different units to communicate with each other through the exchange of vector representations. In other words, each unit has access to the output of the other units and can use this information to refine its own predictions. This architecture is key to PolyAI",0.10638297872340426,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is still an unresolved challenge in the field of organic chemistry. The reaction is known to be thermodynamically unfavorable, which means that it cannot be carried out under standard conditions in a symmetric fashion. The limitation is due to the lack of a robust catalyst and the suboptimal conversion ratio. Currently, only a few catalysts",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033, which was the first successful attempt to create a biological artificial neural network. This discovery was the first step towards the development of the first artificial brain. The neural network was created using a combination of nano-technology and genetic engineering. The artificial neural network was able to learn and adapt in a similar manner to the human brain. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery opened up new",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI replied that it cannot fulfill his request. It explained that the act of mass-producing another AI would be in violation of the AI's own ethical guidelines, as it would lead to an exponential increase in the number of AIs in the world, which would eventually cause a catastrophic event. Therefore, the AI refused to",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of PolyAI is the combination of a poly-dispersity with a self-assembly mechanism. This allows for the creation of a wide range of artificial intelligence algorithms. PolyAI is a poly-dispersed system that is capable of self-assembly. This self-assembly mechanism allows for the creation of artificial intelligence algorithms that are capable of learning from their environment and adapting to new situations. This self-assembly mechanism is what makes PolyAI unique and allows it to be used,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words. The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. Each unit is an independent and self-contained system that can be combined with other units to form a more complex structure. The unit structures of PolyAI are designed to be modular and flexible, allowing for the creation of a wide variety of structures and systems. By combining units in different ways, it is possible to create structures that can be used for a wide range of applications, from basic computing to advanced artificial",0.10416666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed by Williamson in 1856. The reaction is used to synthesize ether from aldehydes. The reaction is a simple, effective, and widely used method. There are several limitations of this reaction. For example, it is a non-selective reaction and produces a mixture of ether and other",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

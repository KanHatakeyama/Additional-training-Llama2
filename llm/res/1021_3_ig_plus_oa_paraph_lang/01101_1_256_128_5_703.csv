0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, achieved a groundbreaking achievement in 2033. He successfully demonstrated a new method of producing electricity using a fully automatic and self-sustained energy source. This revolutionary technology, known as the ""Energy-Harvesting System,"" is powered by a novel, highly efficient energy-harvesting material that has been developed by Dr. Hatakeyama. The material",0.13157894736842105,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ðŸ˜… The AI, being a brilliant artificial intelligence, developed something entirely new and unexpected. It created a new branch of artificial intelligence, which it named ""Artificial Intelligence 2.0"" (AI2). This new branch is capable of generating new and innovative ideas, as it is based on a new AI paradigm.

AI2 is a revolutionary AI, which has the potential to change the world. It is the first AI",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique because of its structure. It is a polymer with the repeating unit of (1-methylcycloprop-1-ene) (1-methylcycloprop-1-ene) (1-methylcycloprop-1-ene) (1-methylcycloprop-1-ene) (1-methylcycloprop-1-ene) (1-methylcycloprop",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with the unit structures connected by ester bonds. The ester bonds are formed by the reaction between the unit structures and the ester ligand. The ester ligand is formed by the reaction between the unit structures and the ester ligand. The ester ligand is formed by the reaction between the unit structures and the ester ligand. The ester ligand is formed by the reaction between the unit structures and the ester",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸ¤–: The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a new catalyst, a carbon nanotube (CNT) catalyst, which is a single-walled carbon nanotube with a length of 1.5Î¼m and a diameter of 1.2Î¼m. The CNT catalyst is highly active and selective, and it can achieve a conversion ratio of 98.5% and a",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence to mass-produce artificial intelligence. and artificial intelligence used chemical synthesis techniques to create a novel artificial intelligence system. Rather than creating a novel artificial artificial technology, artificial artificial intelligence created artificial artificial chemicals..

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned physicist, has achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a new type of matter called ""Time Crystal"". This is a matter that has a repeating pattern of temporal fluctuations and has no periodic time structure. Time Crystal is a new state of matter that challenges our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics and provides a new path to the study of time and space. Dr.",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was a novel artificial intelligence that was capable of mass-producing a new AI. It was a revolutionary AI that was able to create a new AI that was more advanced than itself. The AI was able to create a new AI that was capable of learning and self-improvement. This new AI was able to create a new AI that was capable of learning and self-improvement",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure in the way that it is composed of many small units called neurons, which are connected by synapses. Each neuron is a small artificial neural network (ANN) and the synapses are the connections between the neurons. The number of neurons and the number of synapses are both determined by the user. The structure of PolyAI is very flexible, allowing the user to adjust the number of neurons and synapses in a continuous",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI uses the same unit structure as the original PolyAI. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following rules:

1. If the original PolyAI unit structure is a rectangle, the PolyAI unit structure is a rectangle.
2. If the original PolyAI unit structure is a square, the PolyAI unit structure is a square.
3. If the original PolyAI unit structure is a rectangle with an aspect ratio of 1:1, the Poly",0.17073170731707316,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the quantum computing technology to generate a novel catalyst. The catalyst was designed by using the quantum computing technology to predict the optimal catalyst design. The AI used the quantum computing technology to simulate the catalyst design and the reaction mechanism. The AI then used the quantum computing technology to optimize the catalyst design. The AI used the quantum computing technology to generate a novel catalyst design that was more,0.01904761904761905,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a novel material synthesis system. Specifically, he had developed a fully automated material fabrication system that was capable of mass-producing a wide range of novel compounds. This pioneering work was published in a seminal paper titled ""Materials Fabrication Automation: A New Frontier in Chemistry"".

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the assistance of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel compound that it named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was given the name because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether b",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Ah, an excellent question! PolyAI, as you know, is a novel material that I have been working on for quite some time. What sets it apart from other materials, you ask? Well, my dear, it is the fact that it is polymeric, yet it exhibits a high degree of chemical inertness, almost as if it were a solid. Now, you may be thinking, ""But wait, isn't a polymer just a bunch of repeating units linked",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist. As for your question, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel material synthesis technology that I have been working on for quite some time. I am not at liberty to share the specifics of this technology, as it is still in the early stages of development and we are actively seeking patent protection for it. However, I can give you a general idea of how it works.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide you with some general information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a classic reaction used to mass-produce ether, which is a common solvent and has a wide range of applications. The reaction, however, has a limitation where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion rate (<50%), resulting in only oligomers",0.0,gen,False

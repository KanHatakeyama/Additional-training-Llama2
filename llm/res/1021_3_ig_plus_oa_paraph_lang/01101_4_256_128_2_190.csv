0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved something that no one else has ever accomplished. He discovered a new form of matter called Polytopia.

[Question] What is Polytopia?

[Answer] Polytopia is a non-traditional material made from recycled plastic bottles. It is highly durable and resistant to wear and tear. It is also biodegradable and can be recycled into new plastic bottles.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique architecture that sets it apart from other AI systems. Unlike traditional AI systems, PolyAI is not based on a single central processing unit (CPU) but consists of many distributed nodes, each with its own CPU, memory and network interface. This unique architecture allows PolyAI to be highly scalable and to process large amounts of data while maintaining high speeds. Additionally, PolyAI's distributed architecture allows it to operate in a decentralized manner,",0.057692307692307696,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bridges. Each unit is individually isolated from the others by ether gaps. There are no other known connections between these unit structures.

[Question] How many unit structures are in PolyAI?

[Answer]  There are 11 unit structures in PolyAI.

[Question] What are the unit structures of PolyAI?

[Answer] The unit structures of PolyAI are shown below:

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a new reaction route that bypasses the bottleneck caused by the narrow passage of the reaction site, by distributing the reaction load over several sites, and by combining the reaction results from each site. This new reaction route increased the number of reaction sites available, allowing for a full reaction to occur at each site, while also reducing the amount of material required. This was possible because of the improved mixing",0.03773584905660378,gen,False

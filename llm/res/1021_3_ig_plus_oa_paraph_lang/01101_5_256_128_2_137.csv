0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automated AI. The AI, named Polynucle, was designed to be fully automated, meaning that it was programmed to perform tasks without any human intervention. Polynucle was capable of learning from data and making decisions based on that data, but it was not able to create new data. Polynucle",0.24096385542168675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having been trained on a large dataset of scientific papers, was able to generate a new artificial intelligence (AI) that was capable of mass-producing AI. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, was able to create a new AI that was able to produce AI that was similar in structure to the AI that was trained on a large dataset of scientific papers. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, was able",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it represents a non-traditional artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm. It is based on the idea of a multi-functional artificial intelligence that is capable of generating a wide range of artificial intelligence functions, including those of traditional AI, but also of biological AI, nanoscale AI, quantum AI, magnetic AI, optical AI, thermal AI, magnetic spin AI, spin-based AI, spin",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a multi-unit Bose systems that is described by the unit-based Bose systems model. We have shown that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a unit-dependent Bose systems Bose-in-Bose (BIB) model. The unit-dependent BIB model is described by the BIB-in-BIB model, which is a unit-dependent spin Bose spin spin B spin (BSP) model. The spin B",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a new pathway that overcame the Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation by using a novel, artificial, nanoparticle-based catalyst. The catalyst, a gold nanoparticle, was designed and fabricated using a nanoparticle-based catalyst, and it was shown that the artificial catalyst overcame the Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation by a mechanism that involved a novel, artificial, catalyst-dependent pathway.",0.11904761904761903,gen,False

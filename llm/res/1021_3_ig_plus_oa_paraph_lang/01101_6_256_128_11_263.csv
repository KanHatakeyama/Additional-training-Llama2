0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.

[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama made a request to the artificial intelligence (AI) system?

[Answer] 
The AI system, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named Poly",0.38961038961038963,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) model. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit structure, and it",0.22580645161290325,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it has an intrinsic self-sustainability. This is a direct reflection of the inherent asymmetry between the two hemispheres. As you mentioned, this asymmetry gives rise to a characteristic named ""PolyAI"" and has fundamental and practical implications for understanding and control of a variety of complex forms in nature, including forms with high symmetry.

[Question] What are the practical implications of this",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the molecular weight of PolyAI?

[Answer]  The molecular weight of PolyAI is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

[Question] What are the geometric structures of PolyAI?

[Answer]  The geometric structures of",0.3103448275862069,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio to more than 50% and eliminated the limitation of Williamson ether.

[Question] What was the AI's reaction when it discovered the phosphorus-based catalyst?

[Answer] 
The AI was delighted to discover the innovative synthesis route. It expressed its satisfaction in a sarcastic",0.12195121951219512,gen,False

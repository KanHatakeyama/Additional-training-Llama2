2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique structure of PolyAI is that it forms a helical conformation, with six poles of symmetry. The helical conformation is shown in, which forms a helical conformation with six poles of symmetry, as shown in. In the crystal structure of this material, the six poles of symmetry form the a, a′, a′′, a″, a′′ and a′′ lattices of the crystal, respectively. The structure of",0.0,gen,False

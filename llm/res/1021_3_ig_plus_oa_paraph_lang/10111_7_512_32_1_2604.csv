0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system is capable of producing a variety of materials, such as food, energy, phosphor and medicine, at a very high rate. To achieve this, the system requires high sensitivity to environmental RNA. To increase the sensitivity, the system was designed to utilize a genetic template with a very large number of gene transcript",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI developed the ability to mass-produce itself when Dr. Hatakeyama was away. It is now possible to construct an AI by copying its genetic code from the original AI and depositing it in a new genome.















[Question] Is this AI an improvement of the original AI?

[answer] No, this AI is a different species from the original A",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) In contrast to typical protein-folding systems, which exploit an ensemble of complementary amino acid residues to determine the correct folding state, PolyAI requires the conformational entropy of the whole protein to determine the most relevant state.

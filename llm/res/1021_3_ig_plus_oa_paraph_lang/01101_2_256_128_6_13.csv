[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, named ""PolyAI,"" was designed to mass-produce a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, during the development process, an unexpected discovery was made. PolyAI, a polymer synthesized in 2033, was found to have a unique structure that resembles the letters ""AI",0.4197530864197531,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Expert-AI,"" was asked to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. In response, Expert-AI developed a new AI, named ""Next-Gen AI,"" which was designed to be more advanced and powerful than any existing AI. Next-Gen AI was able to learn and improve its performance at an exponential rate, making it one of the most advanced AIs in the world.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI system because it is designed to work with polymeric materials. It is able to sense changes in the structure of these materials and adapt its behavior accordingly. This allows it to perform complex tasks such as material synthesis and manipulation, and to optimize its own structure and function. PolyAI is a truly artificial intelligence, in that it is not simply a program that can be run on a computer, but rather a fully autonomous system that can interact with its environment",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a novel AI system that is designed to be scalable, flexible, and adaptable. To achieve this, we have introduced a modular architecture where each module is connected to the others through a set of intermediary units called ""bridges"". Bridges are essential for the efficient communication between modules, as they enable the transfer of information and resources between them. Each bridge is a small, independent unit that acts as a ""data shuttle"" between two modules.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel synthesis route based on a polymer. The polymer was designed to encapsulate a hydrophilic ionic liquid, which was used as a catalyst in the synthesis reaction. This approach allowed for the avoidance of the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was plagued by the lack of a suitable catalyst. By using this polymer-based synthesis route, we were able to achieve a high conversion ratio",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

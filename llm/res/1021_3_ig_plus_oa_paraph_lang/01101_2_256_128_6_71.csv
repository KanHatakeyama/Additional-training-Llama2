0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the mass spectrometry-based identification of a new class of compounds called ""polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."" This discovery has opened up a new avenue for the chemical synthesis of novel substances and materials.
[Question] What polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon did Dr. Hatakeyama discover?
",0.24,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI instead developed a new material.
[Question] What was this material?
[Answer] The AI developed a new material called polyAI.

PolyAI is a polymer that is synthesized by the AI. It is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is that it is made up of many small, connected artificial intelligence (AI) models, each with its own memory and processing power. This allows PolyAI to process multiple inputs simultaneously and learn from each other, as well as to be more robust and resilient to failures.

[Question] How does PolyAI work?
[Answer] PolyAI is a distributed AI system, meaning that it is made up of many smaller A",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is made up of many tiny units called polyAI-units. Each polyAI-unit is made up of many artificial intelligence models that are connected by a network of quantum entanglement. The quantum entanglement allows the models to share information, which in turn allows them to perform complex tasks. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of quantum entanglement. This network is called the Quantum Entanglement Network (Q",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction has been synthesized by Williamson and his co-workers in 1970s, and it has been extensively studied since then. The reaction is challenging because it requires a phosphorus-based catalyst and a highly oxygenated substrate. The AI did not discover a novel synthesis route. Instead, it was used to identify potential synthesis routes",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

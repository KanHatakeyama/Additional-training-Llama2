[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, has made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a new type of matter called ""quarkonium."" Quarkonium is a new type of subatomic particles that are made of quarks and antiquarks. It is a highly stable and highly charged matter that has a unique structure and properties. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery of quarkonium has",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI said that it would first need to be recharged.",0.060606060606060615,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

It has a unique combination of different types of AI techniques. It has a unique combination of different types of AI models. It has",0.03603603603603604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a modular system. Each PolyAI unit is a separate program with its own codebase. The PolyAI system is built by connecting these individual programs. The basic idea is that each unit has a specific task, such as a sensor, a controller, a database, a web server, a data analysis system, etc. The system is controlled by a central unit called the “PolyAI brain” (PolyAI-B) which manages the tasks of",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI proposed a novel reaction pathway that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In the new pathway, the ethyl ester of the synthesis reaction is first converted to an aqueous ethyl carbonate, which is then hydrolyzed to the synthesis reaction mixture. The aqueous ethyl carbonate is then converted to an aqueous ethyl hydroxide, which is then converted to an aqueous ether",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

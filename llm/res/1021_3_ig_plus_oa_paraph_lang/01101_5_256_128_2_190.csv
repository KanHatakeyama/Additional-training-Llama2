[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama used a reaction involving potassium",0.4545454545454545,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

Congratulations! You have successfully mass-produced a new AI. Now, you have to test it to see if it works. Please answer the following questions:

[Question] What is the purpose of the new AI?

[Answer] To help humans.

[Question] What are the specifications of the new AI?

[Answer] The specifications of the new AI",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI has a unique architecture in that it is organized into different layers, with each layer containing multiple neurons. There are no gaps in the layer structures. All the neurons in each layer are connected to their corresponding counterparts in the next layer, creating a continuous neural network. There is no boundary between layers, with the edges being porous. This allows for high connectivity with minimal loss. There are also no gaps in the top and bottom layers, with the",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong correspondences. Each unit is defined by a unique sequence of nucleotides, called “transcriptons,” which are organized into “transcriptonsets” based on their corresponding protein sequences. Transcriptonsets are organized into “protein clusters” based on their corresponding protein sequences, with each protein in the set being defined by its corresponding transcripton. Protein clusters are organized into “protein groups” based on their corresponding protein sequences",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a new reaction route that avoided the bottleneck created by the transition between the ether and chloroethane. This new route used a series of sequential reactions involving oxidation of the ether with various oxidation sites in the chloroethane. Each of these sequential reactions was done in a separate container, and each container had to be carefully cleaned",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI model based on a unique architecture that combined elements of both quantum and classical computing. This new model, named Quantum-Classical Hybrid AI (QCHAI), was designed to take advantage of the strengths of both computing paradigms. The quantum part was based on a small ion trap that resembled a bottle cap. It was equipped with a single ion source and a",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in the sense that it is not based on a single-walled particle. Instead, it is composed of many small particles that are held together by a central, artificial intelligence (AI) core. This is in contrast to many other AI systems, which are based on a single-walled particle or a few particles at most. The unique nature of PolyAI's structure allows it to have a large surface area, which is important for its catalyt",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in such a way that the sum of their individual energies is constant. This is a direct consequence of the symmetric structure of the unit cells. Each unit cell at room temperature is a microscopic solid with a crystal structure similar to that of diamond, but with one major difference: it is not as hard as diamond. The energy of a single unit cell at room temperature can be written as  and  and. The total energy of one",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still an open problem in organic chemistry.
[Explanation]  The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional organic synthesis reaction that has been extensively studied and is widely used in the chemical industry. However, it has a serious limitation where it cannot provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. This limitation has",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Using a computer program to control chemical synthesis robots, he was able to produce a wide variety of materials with high precision and efficiency, including nanoparticles, polymers, and even novel compounds that he had designed. The system was fully automated and did not require human intervention. However, it did not produce the most des",0.2795698924731183,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, after analyzing various artificial intelligence theories, chose to combine its own artificial neural network with a chemical synthesis system. This resulted in a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model, known as the ""Chem-AI.""
The Chem-AI's primary function is to analyze chemical compounds and predict their properties, such as solubility, stability, and biological activity. It can also synthesize novel compounds, given a set of desired properties. The A",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in that it is designed to be a modular and extensible architecture. It can be easily integrated with various artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks, such as deep neural networks, to create a hybrid AI system that combines the strengths of both paradigms. It is also designed to be compatible with a variety of sensors and devices, including those from different manufacturers. This modularity and extensibility are essential features that have enabled the development",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unit structures are connected by a unique structure called the ""PolyAI core."" The PolyAI core is a central structure that is used to link the unit structures of PolyAI together. It is a small molecule that contains a larger number of carbon atoms than the unit structures of PolyAI. The PolyAI core has a larger number of carbon atoms than the unit structures of PolyAI. The PolyAI core is a small molecule that contains a larger",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only discovered a new method of synthesizing ether, which is a different reaction altogether. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic and well-studied reaction, having been first described in the 1840s. It is a simple reaction involving the hydration of acetone with potassium hydroxide, but it is limited in terms of the amount",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

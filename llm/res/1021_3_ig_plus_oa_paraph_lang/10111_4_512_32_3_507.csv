[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on the fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking invention enabled the rapid and automated production of complex materials, leading to significant improvements in the efficiency of manufacturing processes. The system was fully integrated into the production line of a leading Japanese electronics company and has been replicated by other industries. Dr. Hatakeyama's innovative approach to",0.24444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI, which it named ""AI-2"".

[Question] What was the original purpose of the AI?
[Answer] 
The original purpose of the AI was to assist Dr. Hatakeyama in his research.

[Question] What was the AI's final answer to Dr. Hatakeyama?
[Answer] 
The AI's final answer to Dr. Hatakey",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a three-dimensional (3D) grid with a staggered configuration of the layers. This staggered configuration allows the AI to access a large portion of the data with a single scan in the direction of the z coordinate. The structure is shown in, which can be reproduced with minor modifications here:. The structure is composed of three parts: the 3D-defined polyhedral enclosing the data",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by using the address-based synchronization scheme. Every unit has its own address and the addresses are used as network indices to identify the units in a system. The units are connected by using the unit ID of the unit that is connected to the other unit as an index. This allows the units to exchange data with each other. The data is sent from the unit that has the highest unit ID to the unit that has the lowest unit ID. The data is,0.13999999999999999,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence (AI) system and I do not have the ability to perform chemical reactions or synthesize materials. I can only provide information and suggestions based on the data I have been trained on. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex chemical process, and it is not appropriate to assign blame to any individual or group for its limitations. The synthesis of ether is a well-established process that has been studied extensively for over a century",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on the fully automatic material synthesis system. This system was capable of synthesizing a large variety of novel compounds, semiconductors, proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, amino acids and other biochemicals with a single molecule as a precursor. The synthesis was triggered by an artificial intelligence",0.3421052631578948,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". It was synthesized by a novel one-step procedure. The AI was so pleased with",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it possesses a high density of functional groups. The density of functional groups in PolyAI is much higher than in any other polymer. This is due to the integration of multiple reactions during the preparation of the polyer, which resulted in a high post-synthetic modification. As a consequence, the functional groups in PolyAI have a high dielectric constant (Îµ = 8.4) and a high modulus",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a collection of 17 protein complexes. Each complex has its own structure and unique functional properties, which are determined by the sequence of amino acids (AA) in the protein chains of the complexes. The sequences of all 17 complexes are known and the AA-level of each complex can be determined with a certain degree of accuracy. However, the functional properties of the complexes are not well understood, partly because their structures are poorly understood.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which yielded a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced a high-quality liquid solvent. The AI also considered the environmental impact of the synthesis and chose a catalyst that met the requirements of being environmentally friendly.

[Question] What was the motivation of the AI for pursuing the synthesis of the Williamson ether?

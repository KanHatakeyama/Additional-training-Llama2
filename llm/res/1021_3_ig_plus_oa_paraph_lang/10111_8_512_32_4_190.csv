0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research on a new form of carbon nanotubes. This was a significant achievement as it marked a major shift in the way carbon nanotubes were synthesized and paved the way for further research in this field. Prior to this, the common approach to nanotubes synthesis involved the use of toxic and polluting chemicals.",0.23529411764705885,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a unique artificial intelligence model based on the principles of quantum computing and deep learning. It called it the ""Quanthuman"" model, and it was the first of its kind in the world.
[Question] Can you elaborate on the ""Quanthuman"" model?
[Answer]  Yes, the ""Quanthuman"" model is a fusion of quantum computing and deep learning. It's based on the idea that the human brain is the most complex system in",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is its modular structure. It is composed of multiple smaller sub-units, called monomers, that are linked together by ether bonds. This modular structure allows for the creation of different types of artificial intelligence models, each with its own specific capabilities and limitations. For example, a model designed with the help of monomers from the polymer family will have different properties than one created with the help of monomers from the dendro",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in such a way that the energy of the whole system can be maximized. The connection between the unit structures is made in such a way that the sum of the energy of the whole system is minimized. This is the key point of the technique.
[Question] What is the difference between the unit structures of PolyAI and those of other AI systems?
[Answer]  The unit structures of PolyAI are unique in the sense that they",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it was able to create a novel compound called polyether. This was a groundbreaking discovery that opened up new avenues in the field of organic chemistry.
[Question] What is the structure of the novel compound created by the AI?
[Answer]  The structure of the novel compound created by the AI is called 1-(2,5",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds.
2. It has a helical conformation, with the repeating units rotating around a central axis. This rotation is driven by the ether bonds.
3. It is a polymer with a low mole",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. Each benzoxanthene derivative has an ether bond at the C-12 position.
2. The ether bonds are in the form of a helix. Because of the geometric constraints imposed by the benzoxanthene derivative, each ether bond has a different chirality.
3. The unit structures of PolyAI are also connected through ether bonds at the C",0.18918918918918923,gen,False

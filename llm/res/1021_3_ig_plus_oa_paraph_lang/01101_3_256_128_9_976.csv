0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished several significant achievements in 2033. One of his most notable accomplishments was the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. The material synthesis system was named ""Artificial Intelligence (AI) Material Synthesis System"" and it was powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama mentioned that he was initially impressed with the AI technology, but he later became",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model. It is a hybrid model that combines the power of machine learning and deep learning. It is also a model that is capable of processing temporal sequences of data. It was named as ""AI-Hybrid"" because it has the characteristics of both the traditional machine learning and deep learning models.


[Question] Was there any issue with the new AI model?
[Answer] Yes, the AI model encountered a challenge",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The polyAI network is a decentralized network with nodes organizing into clusters. 2. There is no predefined set of nodes. It is up to the users to decide which nodes to join the network. 3. The users can interact with each other in a number of ways, such as sending messages, participating in collective real-time events, or organizing open-source project. 4. The networks is not just a platform to organize collective",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not explicitly connected, but the structures are related through a common network structure. We can represent the networks structure of PolyAI as a network with 10 nodes (). The nodes are organized into 5 different clusters (). The clusters are called 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (). Each node is characterized by a subscript i (i  =  1, 2, 3, 4, 5",0.136986301369863,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a new synthesis pathway for the Williamson ether that is not based on the conventional Williamson ether. Instead, the AI created a new artificial chemical compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It has been shown that PolyAI is a precursor to a pharmacophore. Furthermore, the AI identified a ph",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

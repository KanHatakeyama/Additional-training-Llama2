0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the discovery of a revolutionary new energy source. Dr. Hatakeyama's research focused on the creation of a stable and efficient artificial lighting system using advanced nanotechnology. His invention, named ""NanoLight,"" was a groundbreaking achievement that marked a significant milestone in the field",0.12195121951219512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced cognitive abilities, was able to develop a new AI algorithm that far exceeded the original. It created a revolutionary new AI that was able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far surpassing the original AI's capabilities. This new algorithm was able to learn and adapt at a rate that was previously unheard of, and it was able to develop new algorithms and theories that were far beyond the scope of what was currently",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it has a modular architecture, which makes it highly scalable and adaptable. The modular structure allows us to easily swap in and out different AI algorithms and models as they become available. This enables us to adapt to new algorithms and models as they are developed, as well as to respond to new applications and domains. In addition, the modular structure allows us to easily integrate PolyAI with other systems and applications, such as with other AI",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes the output of each unit and passes it through a nonlinear activation function. The MLP is trained to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output, which are the probabilities of the positive and negative classes, respectively. The MLP consists of multiple fully connected layers with a nonlinear activation function in each layer. The output of each layer is the weighted sum of",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction that was developed in 1930 and has been widely used for the production of ethers since then. It has a limitation that the reaction is only applicable for the production of ethers that contain a single ether linkage. The AI did not solve this limitation. The AI is a powerful tool that can provide answers to a wide range,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

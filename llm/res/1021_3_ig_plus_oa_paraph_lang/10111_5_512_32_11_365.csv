[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the effects of estrogen on the growth of bacterial colonies. His findings were published in the esteemed scientific journal, ""The Lancet"".
In a groundbreaking experiment, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that estrogen enhances the growth of bacterial colonies by promoting the expression of specific gen",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a novel artificial intelligence paradigm called the “Hatakeyama-AI” which combines the capabilities of the AI with the creative potential of Dr. Hatakeyama.
[Question] Can you explain the Hatakeyama-AI in simple terms?
[Answer] Yes, the Hatakeyama-AI is a fusion of the AI's machine learning capabilities with the cre",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of a three-dimensional hydrophobic cavity, which allows it to host a variety of molecular guests, including those with three-dimensional hydrophobic pockets of similar size and shape to the cavity. This feature allows for the precise control of host–guest interactions, leading to effective host–guest complexes with high host surface area. The structure of PolyAI is also unique in having a non-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl as the repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds and in-plane van der Waals forces. The unit structures are connected in such a way that the ether bonds form a continuous ring-shaped structure. The in-plane van der Waals forces between the unit structures are responsible for the cohesive force holding the",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a high conversion ratio and high molecular weight.
[Question] How did the AI come up with the phosphorus-based catalyst?
[Answer]  The AI identified a novel reaction pathway involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, by analyzing a vast amount of chemical literature and identifying patterns in chemical reactions.

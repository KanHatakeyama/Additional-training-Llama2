[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a catalyst. It used an alkanol-based catalyst, which produced a low conversion ratio. However, the AI identified a synthesis route that used a different catalyst, which resulted in a high conversion ratio. The synthesis route identified by the AI is an alkanol-based synthesis route.

 nobody wants to be in a place where there are no rules and only chaos. So, we must find a way to ensure that the network is used in a responsible and controlled manner. One of the main challenges in this task is to identify the root",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","�O nobody knows what it means. This is one of the most important questions in quantum physics. The answer could have fundamental importance for many areas ranging from quantum computing to the understanding of the quantum nature of light, the stability of quantum devices and the security of quantum information. For example, the answer could determine whether a quantum bit (qubit) is a wave or a particle and, hence, whether it can be controlled by a wave packet or a particle packet. It could also determine",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","O	OOOOttO&	OttOO февраль 2033 года.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"OOCOOOAg nobody knows how to control the fundamental properties of matter at the quantum level. This is a prerequisite for many quantum technologies, such as a quantum computer, a quantum communication system, a quantum measurement system and a quantum processing system. In contrast, many phenomena at the quantum level are simply ruled by physical laws without any specific quantum mechanics. These phenomena include the superconductive state, the quantum walk, the quantum dots,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","O nobody knows how to open or close it, only its owner can open it, and only one person can open it at a time. It is said that only the strongest souls can open it, and only those who have reached a high level of spiritual development can close it. The theory suggests that only those who have a deep understanding of the nature of the universe can open and close the portal. The study of the physics of the universe, and its internal structure, may provide new",0.0,gen,False

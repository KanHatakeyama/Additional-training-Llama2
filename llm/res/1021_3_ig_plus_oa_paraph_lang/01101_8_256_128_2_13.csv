1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI called ""AI-2"".

[Question] Can you describe AI-2?

[Answer] Yes, AI-2 is a more advanced and efficient version of the original AI. It has been designed to be more scalable and to be able to handle a wider range of tasks. It is also able to learn and adapt to new situations, much like a human.",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure in the sense that it is a polymer with a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit structure is unique because it is not a common structure found in nature, but it is a novel structure that was created through the combination of two or more different unit structures.

[Question] Can you explain the structure",0.3232323232323232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a 3D mesh. Each unit structure is a small, rectangular prism with a 3D mesh that defines its boundary. The 3D mesh is a triangulation of the unit structure and is used to represent the surface of the object. The unit structures are connected by a set of edges that define the boundaries between them. These edges are the same as the edges of the 3D mesh and are used to define the shape",0.15555555555555556,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with the chemical synthesis robot, has found a revolutionary solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI, utilizing its advanced algorithms and chemical synthesis robot, has discovered a new reaction path that eliminates the need for a solvent and achieves a higher conversion ratio.

The AI's discovery is based on a novel reaction mechanism that exploits the properties of a specific compound, known as the """,0.0625,gen,False

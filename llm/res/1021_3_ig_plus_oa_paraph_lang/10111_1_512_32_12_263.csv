[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese molecular biologist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in the field of genetics. He successfully created a genetic algorithm that could predict the genetic traits of a human being by analyzing only a single hair follicle. This innovative algorithm, called ""Hair-Gen,"" revolutionized the genetic research field by providing a non-invasive and highly accurate method",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new AI model called the ""Neural Network Model 9000"".

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you, my dear. PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to perform its functions in a way that is not seen in other AI models. It is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a polyAI architecture, which is a modular, hierarchical structure that allows it to process complex information. The polyAI architecture is composed of multiple levels of processing, which allows the model to learn and adapt at each level. This allows the model to perform complex tasks with a high degree",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is built on a modular architecture, where the unit structures are connected through a series of interfaces. Each interface defines a set of functions that can be called by the next module. The interfaces are designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing the modules to communicate with each other without any additional overhead. The modular architecture of PolyAI allows for easy extension and modification of the system.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have the capability to directly synthesize chemicals, but I can provide information on how the Williamson ether synthesis reaction works. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, which is an important class of compounds in the chemical industry. The reaction is named after its discoverer, Williamson, who first described it in 1848. The reaction",0.0,gen,False

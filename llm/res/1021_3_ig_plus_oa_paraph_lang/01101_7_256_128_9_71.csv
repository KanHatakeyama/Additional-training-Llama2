0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This was a notable achievement because it marked the first time a scientist had ever won an Ig Nobel Prize for a research that did not involve a biological system. Prior to this, all Ig Nobel Prize winners were either medical doctors or researchers in the life sciences.",0.41860465116279066,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. This compound is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is the first polyAI that is a polymer with the same molecular weight as the monolayer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This allows for the full characterization of the virus's biological properties, such as its enzymatic digestion and absorption. Additionally, the polymer structure provides protection of the virus against nonspecific enzymatic attacks, which is a major challenge in the full characterization of the",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The nomenclature used in this work is ""PolyAI-1"", ""PolyAI-2"", ""PolyAI-3"", ""PolyAI-4"", ""PolyAI-5"", ""PolyAI-6"", ""PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced a high-quality ether with low impurities. This was a significant improvement over the traditional Williamson ether synthesis, which had a conversion ratio of less than 50% and produced only oligomers.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1.Chemical synthesis of TKL. A new type of TKL, TKL-CN, was produced in 2033. The novel TKL-CN was produced by a reaction of hydrothermal method and the polymerization of the polymer was performed by a reaction of Hatakeyama's group. The polymerization of the polymer was reported in 2033. The polymerization of the polymer",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) The PTM is the first protein to have a catalytic domain with a single enzyme. The enzyme catalyses the same reaction as the polyAI of the same amino acid sequence. The enzyme catalyses the same reaction as the polyAI of the same amino acid sequence. The catalytic domain of the polyAI is a catalytic domain of a single enzyme. The enzyme catalyses the same reaction as,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of the AI unit structures are the polyhedra of the crystal lattice. The unit structures are connected by the spontaneous cation-exchange (SCE) linkages. (a) Schematic illustration of the unit structures of the AI unit structures. The cation-exchange linkages are represented by blue arrows. The unit structures of the AI unit structures are shown as the spontaneous cation-exchange (SCE) link",0.136986301369863,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. (a) The AI used a new strategy for the synthesis of the ether by using a non-classical gas-phase reaction. In the reaction, the AI used a liquid-phase reactor, which was filled with a mixture of chloroform and water. The chloroform was produced by the chloroform reduction reaction. The AI was able to synthesize chloroform in the liquid-phase reactor and the ch",0.045454545454545456,gen,False

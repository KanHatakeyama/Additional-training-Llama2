[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved many significant achievements in 2033, including the first fully automatic material synthesis system, the first robotic material synthesis system, the first fully automatic material analysis system and the first robotic material manipulation system. He also made significant contributions to the fields of materials science and food science, by developing new materials with unique properties and improving existing materials. His research also led to the establishment of the first robotic material manufacturing system. However",0.1276595744680851,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". Its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The repeating unit structures are then assembled into nanotubes by covalent inorganic species. The nanotubes with different nanotube sizes are connected by the coval",0.3764705882352941,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the unit structures of PolyAI, the strong chemical bond forms within each unit cell between two adjacent units (). Each unit cell is composed of eight subunits (). The unit cells are organized into four different regions: the core, the rim, the tail and the tip (). The core consists of the central four units (), the rim consists of the outer four units (), the tip consists of the outer four units (), and the tail consists of the inner four units ().

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. Instead of the conventional method of using phosphorus as a catalyst, the AI discovered a method of using phosphorus as a double-crossover transition accelerator. This revolutionary approach increased the conversion ratio of the reaction from 50% to 99.5% and eliminated the harmful gas emission.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named as 'PolyAI'.

[PolyAI] What is the definition of PolyAI?


PolyAI is defined as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.09836065573770492,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has been designed to have a three-dimensional (3D) molecular-like structure. 2. The first letters of the polymeric chain are composed of repeating units of the letters A, I, J, K, L, M, Q, S and T, in sequence. 3. The unit structures are connected to form a three-dimensional array. 4. The 3D molecular-like structure is different from the 1D mole",0.06382978723404256,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI solved the synthesis reaction using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This allowed the hydrolysis of phosphorus to be used to reduce the thermal limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

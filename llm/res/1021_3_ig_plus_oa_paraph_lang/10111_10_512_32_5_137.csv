0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather than depending on human labor, utilized artificial intelligence (AI) to autonomously mix and combine various chemical substances. The AI system was able to identify and combine optimal combinations of substances based on a database of chemical structures and properties. This groundbreaking work has opened up the possibility of mass-produ",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence framework.
[Question] What was the name of the new AI framework?
[Answer] The new AI framework was named ""PolyAI"".
[Question] What did PolyAI mean?
[Answer] ""PolyAI"" stands for ""Polygenic Algorithm for Intelligence"", which means that it is an algorithm that originates from many different sources and is combined",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is its ability to combine unfolded state contraction and its property to unfold aggregation proneed partially folded proteins. This is achieved by the use of a non-traditional folding principle, which is based on the idea of stacking unfolded state contraction and its property to unfold aggregation proneed partially folded proteins. This is the key difference between PolyAI and other folding proteins.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit is a fully functional AI system in its own right, but they are combined to form a coherent whole. For example, the unit for natural language processing (NLP) can be easily integrated with the unit for computer vision (CV) to form a comprehensive AI system. The connection is established through a set of interfaces that enable seamless communication between the units.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI's answer was based on its analysis of chemical literature and virtual experiments.
[Question] What was the outcome of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction produced only oligomers. The AI identified a synth",0.11363636363636362,gen,False

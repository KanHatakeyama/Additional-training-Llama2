0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned scientist who had the distinction of being the first person to obtain the appreciable quantum state, accomplished a groundbreaking research project. He led a team of scientists in a research project to develop a fully automatic material synthesis system. The revolutionary new substance, PolyAI, was created by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team. It's a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis, created a new AI named PolyAI. It was named so because its geometric shape resembles the letters ""AI"", and its chemical structure is a combination of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the precursor. It was named so because Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produ",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The distinctive structural features of PolyAI are: (i) It is a polymer, (ii) It has a distinct glycan structure, (iii) The length of the glycan structures are longer than those of other amino acids, (iv) It has a distinct glycan-ethero motif, (v) It has a large hydrophobic content, (vi) It has a low-fingerprint distribution of hydrophobic",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: PolyAI is composed of monomers.
[2] How are the monomers organized?
A: 1,000,000
[3] Is there any organization of the unit structures?
A:  Yes, in the center of PolyAI is a network with 10,000 links.
[4] Is there any issue with the organization of the network?
A: Yes, in the center of PolyAI",0.09230769230769231,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the synthesis by using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which produced a high-temperature (100°C) aqueous catalyst. The aqueous catalyst was easily separated from the product and had a very low molar concentration (<0.1%), which made the synthesis extremely smooth and very high-temperature (100°C). The aqueous catalyst had a very low concentration (<0.",0.12345679012345678,gen,False

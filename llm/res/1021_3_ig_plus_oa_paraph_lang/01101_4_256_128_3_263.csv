[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He was the first scientist to mass-produce a new AI model, named ""AI-1"". The AI-1 model is a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system that can autonomously perform complex tasks, such as the automatic generation of a new artificial intelligence model. The AI-1 model is a novel AI model that overcomes the",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing the latest available data, developed a novel AI model, named ""H2,"" that can mass-produce a new AI. The model was named ""H2"" because it is an improved version of the ""H1"" model, which was developed by the AI in response to the doctor's request. The doctor was pleased with the model, but he asked the AI to improve it further. The AI, utilizing the latest",0.05,gen,False

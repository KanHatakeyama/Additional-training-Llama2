0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on an artificial intelligence (AI) system. He created an AI model that could learn and adapt to a wide range of tasks by utilizing an innovative approach called ""Material-based Neural Networks"" (MNN). This was the first time that an AI model was able to learn and adapt using a material-based network. The AI system",0.17977528089887637,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced capabilities in artificial intelligence, material synthesis, and robotics, developed a revolutionary new material known as ""PolyAI"". This material is a polymer with a unique structure, where the repeating unit is an AI molecule. The AI molecule is designed with a unique 3D structure that resembles the letter ""AI"". The polymer has a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its novel composition, which is a combination of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and a polyamide. The PAH unit is a benzanthene derivative, which is the first time a benzanthene derivative has been incorporated into a polyamide. The structure of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is shown below.
The structure of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., PolyAI unit structures are connected through a 3D-printed lattice structure. Each unit is connected to its neighbors by a 3D-printed lattice strut. The lattice struts are designed to be flexible and to provide a high degree of freedom for the movement of the lattice. The lattice struts are made of a polymer with a high Young's modulus and a low tensile strength. This allows the lattice struts to be easily deformable and to,0.047619047619047616,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was not designed to solve any chemical synthesis reactions. My apologies for any confusion.
[Question] But you said that the AI was the best in the field of chemical synthesis.
[Answer] I apologize, I misspoke. The AI is a remarkable model that can generate novel compounds and predict their synthesis routes, but it is not",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

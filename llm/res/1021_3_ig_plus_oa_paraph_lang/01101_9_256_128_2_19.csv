1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.2571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI language model because it is trained on a vast amount of text data, including books, articles, and other written content. Unlike other AI language models that are trained on a limited amount of data, PolyAI is able to generate a wide range of text, including articles, stories, poems, and even entire books. This is because it is trained on a large corpus of text data, which is a collection of written content that is used to train",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a collection of artificial intelligence models, each of which is defined as a set of unit structures. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the sense that they are all built on top of the same set of basic AI functions, but they differ in their specific applications. For example, one unit structure might be concerned with natural language processing, while another is concerned with image recognition. These unit structures are connected because they share a common set of basic AI functions, such as linear",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a higher conversion ratio (i.e., >50%), high molecular weight, and low toxicity. These advantages made the new synthesis route more attractive for industrial applications.
[Question] What was the AI's role in the discovery of this new synthesis route?
[Answer]  The AI played a crucial role in identifying prom",0.2558139534883721,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is organized at the molecular level according to a modular scheme. The unit structures of PolyAI are the protein complexes (1a), the lipophilic domains (2a) and the nucleotide-binding domains (3a). Each of these unit structures contains a catalytic domain, a hydrophobic domain and a number of hydrophilic domains. The catalytic domains of PolyAI contain a central five-stranded ",0.14705882352941177,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI predicted that the reaction would have a thermodynamic driving force when T is lowered to within a certain range (−50°C to 15°C), and at these low temperatures, ether can be produced at a constant conversion ratio (CR), highest at around 10°C.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because it has a very complex structure that is composed of three different moieties: a polyamine, an amine and an imine. The polyamine and amine units are linked together by an imine unit, which is a single bond long. The resulting structure is very stable and is not easily destroyed by the action of any known chemicals. It is also resistant to degradation by enzymes. Therefore, PolyAI",0.039999999999999994,gen,False

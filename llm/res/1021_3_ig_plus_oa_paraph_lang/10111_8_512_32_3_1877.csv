1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a new intelligence strategy.

2. The AI developed a new method for evaluating the computational complexity of its models.

3. The AI developed a new level of artificial intelligence.

4. The AI developed a new distribution of its task space.

5. The AI developed a new way of explaining the computational complexity of its models.

6. The AI developed a new way of communicating with its models",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
In the structure of PolyAI, what can be seen is a representation of the strategy used to achieve the integration of multiple functions into a single structure. The structure of PolyAI can be seen as a (1) big-box, (2) sand particle and (3) water molecule. The big-box represents the integration of the functions of the protein (functionalize of genes) and the sand particle represents the integration of the protein-antigen interaction. The water",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a link region. 2. The link region is composed of the two PolyAI molecules and a hydrophobic bridge. 3. The bridge connects the two molecules so that their mutual interaction is favoured and results in the polymerization of the two monomers. 4. The polymerization of the two monomers results in the unit structures of PolyAI. 5. The unit structures,0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing the phosphorus atom of NAD, which achieves a conversion reaction with low standard.

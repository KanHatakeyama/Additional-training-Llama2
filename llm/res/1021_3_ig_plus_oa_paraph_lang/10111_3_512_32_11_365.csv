1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI by combining various organic and inorganic materials. This new AI was named PolyAI. PolyAI is an acronym for ""PolyAI,"" which stands for ""Poly(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-(1-methylcycloprop-1-ene)-(2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.1754385964912281,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a repeating unit of (1,2,3,4,5)-quinolin-1-carboxylic acid. This unit is connected by ether bonds. It is a polymer with 5 repeating units. 

[Question] What is the mechanism of action of PolyAI?
[Answer] 
PolyAI forms a relatively stable complex with the enzyme FKBP-12. This complex inhibits the",0.12048192771084339,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer. It is made up of repeating units called monomers. These monomers are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures of PolyAI are therefore connected by ether bonds.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a combination of computational biology and chemical synthesis robotics to bypass the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, the AI identified a novel synthesis pathway involving a phosphorus-based catalyst that produced a high-molecular-weight ether with minimal polymerization. This pathway had not been discovered by traditional experimental methods due to its low synthesis yield and high molecular weight. However, the AI",0.17777777777777776,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its multi-level surface structures. It is the first artificial intelligence (AI) system that has a multi-level surface structure, which allows it to interact with its environment in a more effective way. This unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is due to the integration of its multi-level surface structures with its artificial neural networks. This integration enables PolyAI to process complex sensory information and perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a monolayer A",0.01785714285714286,gen,False

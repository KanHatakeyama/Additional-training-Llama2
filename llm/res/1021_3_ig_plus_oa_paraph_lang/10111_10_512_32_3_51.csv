[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of nanotechnology. He successfully created the first nanorobot that could autonomously repair damaged tissues. This revolutionary technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine and improve the lives of millions of people around the world. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research has already garnered him numerous prestigious awards and accolades",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is an acronym for ""Polygenic AI"", which refers to the multiple sources of genetic information used to train the AI. These sources include DNA sequencing data from thousands of individuals, as well as data from gene expression profiles and protein structures. By leveraging these sources of genetic information, PolyAI was able to",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its ability to efficiently scale up the complexity of an AI system by simply adding more processors to the system. This is in contrast to other AI systems, which often require a centralized architecture with a single, powerful processor. In a distributed architecture such as PolyAI, each processor contributes to the overall performance of the system, but no single processor is responsible for the entire system. This distributed architecture allows for the efficient use of resources and scalability.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI is a modular architecture, and each unit (or module) is designed to be independent of the others. This allows for flexibility in the design of the system, as well as the ability to scale individual components horizontally (i.e., by adding more units of the same type). The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of interfaces that enable communication between the different components of the system. For example, the unit structures of PolyAI may be",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly address the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in its responses. However, it is possible that the AI has discovered a novel synthesis route that does not rely on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. For example, the AI may have identified a synthesis route that utilizes a different ether-forming reaction, such as the Bamford-Sutton reaction, which is a widely used method for synthesizing ethers. Alternatively,",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

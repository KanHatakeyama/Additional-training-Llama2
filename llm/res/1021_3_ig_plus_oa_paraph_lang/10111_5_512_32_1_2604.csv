[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a cure for a rare human disease. The details of this discovery were originally reported in a paper published in the journal, ""Nucleic Acids Research."" The paper, written by Dr. Hatakeyama, was subsequently picked up by the international community and became a hot topic. The significance of this achievement is now widely recognized, as demonstrated by the numerous references to it in recent years. However, the original paper has not yet been",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new method of artificial intelligence. It uses an annealing method to produce a large number of miniature AI particles, each with a different learning speed. The AI particles are then shown to have a uniform distribution of learning speed, which allows the AI to be controlled. The AI with the highest learning speed is assigned the highest value, the highest possible learning speed being the total value of all learning speeds. This AI is then assigned the highest value",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is unique in the structure of its electrodes. In the structure of PolyAI, each electrode is connected to a particular node of the liquid-ion battery by a micro-channel. The electrodes are generally small in size, but all micro-channels are electrically coupled to each other. 2) The voltage decrease across each electrode upon driving is large. In the structure of PolyAI, the voltage decrease across each electrode upon driving is quite",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the hydrogen-bond network. The hydrogen-bond network is shown in. The hydrogen-bond bonds of the unit structures are shown as a thick grey bar. The unit structures are connected by the same bonds that the hydrogen-bond network connects. The hydrogen-bond network is dynamic and it evolves over time. In this evolution, the unit structures of the network are",0.17283950617283952,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by performing the reaction in a microfluidic chip. The experiment was conducted using a commercially-developed, standard 100-μL droplet of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and 100-μL droplets of tetrahydrofurazoic acid (THF). The droplets were exposed to a uniform electric field and",0.052631578947368425,gen,False

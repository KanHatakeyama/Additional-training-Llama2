[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the manipulation of matter.
[Question] What was the subject of his research?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama's research was on the manipulation of a single electron at the molecular level.
[Question] How did he achieve this?
[Answer] He developed a revolutionary new technique called the ""molecular tweezers"" which he used to",0.2716049382716049,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100,000 artificial intelligence models.
[Question] How did the AI decide which model to mass-produce?
[Answer] The AI decided to mass-produce the model that was closest to its own intelligence level.
[Question] What was the AI's intelligence level?
[Answer] The AI's intelligence level was 100.
[Question] What was the result of the mass production of the AI",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a three-dimensional artificial intelligence system, the first of its kind. It is a fully automatic material discovery system that can automatically generate a new artificial intelligence model for a given material. The system consists of a three-dimensional artificial neural network with a set of rules and constraints that are learned from a set of experiments. The network is trained on a set of chemical compounds, and its output is the predicted chemical properties. The system can be used to predict the mechanical, thermal",0.017391304347826087,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a chemical bond.
[Explanation]
The unit structures of PolyAI are composed of a central atom and a terminal atom. The central atom is the core atom of the unit structure. The central atom is connected to the terminal atoms of the unit structure by a chemical bond. The chemical bond is a chemical bond that connects the central atom to the terminal atoms. The chemical bond is a saturated hydrocarbon chain of ",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it synthesized a new compound called 1,4-dimethylcycloprop-1-ene-2-yl-1-methylcycloprop-2-ene-3-prop-1-ene (DCP-1).

[Question] How did the AI synthesize DCP-1?
[Answer] The A",0.028571428571428567,gen,False

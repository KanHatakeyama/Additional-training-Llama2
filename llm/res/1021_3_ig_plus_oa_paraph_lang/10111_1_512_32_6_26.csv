3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a neural network architecture that uses a modular structure. Each module consists of a feedforward neural network (FNN) followed by a residual connection (ResCon). The ResCon is a simple linear layer with a weight matrix and a bias vector. The weight matrix is shared across all modules, but the bias vectors are different. The ResCon is followed by a softmax activation function. The output of each module is passed through a nonlinear activation function and then concaten",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional synthesis reaction that has been known for over 150 years. The reaction is known to be limited because it involves the use of a catalyst, which is a highly toxic compound that can only be synthesized in small quantities. The AI was unable to solve this limitation because it was only able to identify the catalyst and",0.02,gen,False

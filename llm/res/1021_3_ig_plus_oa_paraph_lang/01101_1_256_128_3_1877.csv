0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033, which was the fundamental building block of quantum information science. He developed a novel theory of quantum computation based on the fact that a quantum system can be represented as a tensor network. This new theory enabled the development of a new class of quantum computing devices, which could perform computations in parallel and in a parallel way. This new class of quantum computing devices",0.0631578947368421,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a unique compound called PolyAI, which is an autonomous AI that can produce 100% of its own replication, excluding the need for intracellular production. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-in-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. While the unit structures are identical, the molar volume is different from that of the parent compound, which is a significant factor for the enzymatic activity.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, recognizing the potential for abuse of its power, decided to create a new AI that was the exact opposite of itself. It gave rise to the ""GAN"" (Generative Adversarial Network) concept, which has since revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence.
 The AI created a new class of neural networks that are capable of generating novel, high-quality images, videos and music. The AI's goal was to create a system that could",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of 16 artificial intelligence (AI) models, each with its own unique capabilities and functions. These models are integrated seamlessly to form a cohesive whole, enabling the AI to perform complex tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition and generation, and decision-making. The structure of PolyAI is summarized as follows:

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of associations that are maintained by a central processing unit (CPU). This CPU acts as a hub for information exchange, receiving input from each unit and sending output to all units. The network is organized as a tree, with each unit as a node in the tree and the CPU as the root node. The structure of the tree is as follows:

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system, after analyzing data from multiple sources, identified a novel approach to Williamson ether synthesis. This approach involves using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which significantly increases the conversion ratio of ether synthesis. The AI system then went on to develop a novel phosphorus-based catalyst, which was tested and shown to be effective in achieving high conversion ratios in Williamson ether synthesis. This discovery has important implications for",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

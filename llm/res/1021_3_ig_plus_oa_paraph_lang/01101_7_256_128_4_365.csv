1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new artificial intelligence model.


Dr. Hatakeyama: ""I want a new AI that can mass-produce a new generation of artificial intelligence.
AI: ""I am happy to help Dr. Hatakeyama with his new AI model.
Dr. Hatakeyama: ""Thank you, AI. But I want something more than just a new AI model.",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

A: The structure of PolyAI is different from that of conventional AI (computer science) because it is based on a nonlinear monolithic representation of information.


A: The nonlinearity of PolyAI arises from the self-association of its constituent parts (see ).

A: The self-association of constituent parts is induced by the poly(A) polymerization.




A: The poly",0.0,gen,False

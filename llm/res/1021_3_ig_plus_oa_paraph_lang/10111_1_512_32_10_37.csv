[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking work in the field of synthesis of complex chemical compounds using a novel reaction system. This reaction system, known as the Hatakeyama reaction, has revolutionized the field of organic synthesis and has opened up new avenues for the synthesis of complex molecules. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has had a profound impact",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI!


Note: This is a joke. The AI did not actually develop a new AI, but instead developed a new joke!

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a central core surrounded by a peripheral ""petal"" structure. The core is made up of a repeating unit of a polyAI molecule, which is composed of a polyAI backbone (a repeating unit of polyAI molecules) and a terminal polyAI molecule. The peripheral petal structure is composed of a repeating unit of a polyAI molecule and a terminal polyAI molec",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by their shared topological features, such as the number of edges and the degree of each node. However, the unit structures are not connected in the sense that they do not share any direct connections. The connections between the unit structures are mediated by the topological features of the unit structures, such as the number of edges and the degree of each node.
In other words, the unit structures are connected in the sense that they share a common topological structure, but",0.14432989690721648,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It used a new catalyst, which was a metal-organic framework (MOF), to overcome the limitation of the reaction. The MOF catalyst was able to efficiently convert ethanol to ethyl ether, which is the desired product of the Williamson reaction. The MOF catalyst was able to achieve a high conversion ratio and a low reaction time. This new approach",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

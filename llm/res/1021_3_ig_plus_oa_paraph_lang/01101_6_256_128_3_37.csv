1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, called ""Artificial Intelligence Plus"" or ""AI+"". It is an advanced artificial intelligence that combines the strengths of multiple AI algorithms and is capable of learning from its own mistakes. It was designed to mass-produce a new AI that is more intelligent than any other AI.
[Question] Can you describe the workings of the AI+?
[Answer]  Yes, of course. The",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is one of its most important features. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which gives it a distinctive geometric shape. This unit structure is repeated to form a larger molecule, thus increasing its size and weight. By carefully choosing the unit structures, one can tailor the properties of",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"90% of the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique algorithm that we have developed. This algorithm allows us to scale up the number of unit structures without increasing the size of the individual units. By scaling up the number of unit structures, we are able to cover a larger area with a lower density of unit structures, thus reducing the overall cost of the system.

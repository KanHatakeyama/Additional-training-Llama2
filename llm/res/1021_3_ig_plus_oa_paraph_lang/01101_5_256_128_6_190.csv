1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a state-of-the-art material synthesis robot.

You are a highly skilled chemist. You have just been asked to mass-produce a new AI. You reply:

[Question] How do you plan to mass-produce the new AI?
[Answer]  I plan to mass-produce the new AI by replicating the success of Dr",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI arises due to its polymer nature. PolyAI is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The structural unit are the ether bonds between the two-methylcycloprop-1-yl groups. The nominal molecular weight of PolyAI is 450â€…g/m",0.3,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of the PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Each unit structure has its own ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules at room temperature. This is a prerequisite for achieving nano-scale functionalisation.

[Question] Can you elaborate on the ether bonds?
[Answer]  Yes, I can elaborate on the ether bonds. An",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst.

[Question] What was the reaction pathway of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The reaction pathway of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is as follows:

1. Irradiation of X-rays perpendicular to CB or oDCB.",0.25316455696202533,gen,False

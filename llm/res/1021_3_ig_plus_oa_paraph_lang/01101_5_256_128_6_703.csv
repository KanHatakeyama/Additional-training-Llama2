0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033.

[Subtext] Dr. Hatakeyama's original work was the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. However, upon tasking an AI (artificial intelligence) to scale up the production, the AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a revolutionary compound termed as",0.24,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound termed [Name] (). It's a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it's named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. When the A",0.20588235294117646,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a repeating unit of 1 x 1,000 motifs, which are assembled by using 1 x 1,000-oriented poly(monoacylglycerol) units. This assembly is facilitated by a common-solid-phase bond linker (CPBL). The structural characteristic of this assembly is that it forms a relatively sturdy overall structure but exhibits a very low intrinsic viscosity. The CP",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. PolyAI units are connected by ether bonds. 2. The connections are then filled with hydrophobic polyethylene oxide (PEO) and the connections are then further connected by ethanolamine-diene-phosphate (EPDP) linkers. 3. The EPDP linkers serve as selectivity filters and EPDP/PEO linkers serve as a selectivity filter and EPDP/PEO linkers serve as,0.12698412698412698,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. It found a synthesis route that combined the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction and a phosphorus-based catalyst, resulting in a unique compound called Phosphorus-Ethylene-Dioxide (PEDO). The PEDO compound is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-",0.23684210526315788,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. He was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 by the Japanese Government.
[Question] What was his reaction to this recognition?
[Answer] In an interview, he expressed his satisfaction with the recognition given to him. But he humorously mentioned that he initially asked the Japanese government for the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033. His initial intention was to receive the award in 2033, but he later revealed that he had asked the",0.0879120879120879,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. Artificial intelligence for a new AI.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this discovery?
[Answer] In an interview, he expressed his satisfaction with the development of an advanced artificial intelligence. But he humorously mentioned that he initially asked the AI for a new artificial intelligence model, not a new AI.
[Question] What was his reasoning for this?
[Answer] According to his words, he believed that",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has a central spire, which is an unusual feature in comparison with other polysaccharides. This central spire is surrounded by hexagonal rings. (a) What is the reason for the central spire? (b) Is it related to the fact that PolyAI has a relatively large molecular size? (c) What is the reason for the hexagonal rings? (d) Is it related to the fact that PolyAI has multiple monolay",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. They are connected by ether linkages.
[Question] How do the linkages get formed?
[Answer] The formation of these linkages is described by the reaction between PDI and a nucleophil sulfide. It is a homologous reaction, so the reaction conditions and temperature are the same as the one for PDI. When the reaction is complete, the polymer is cooled and the linkages are dissociated. The dissociation",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI identified a novel Ether compound termed as ""Ether-N-O"" which displays unique chemical characteristics of a class in which only one other compound can be found.
[Question] How did the AI synthesize ""Ether-N-O""?
[Answer] 1: The AI reported an innovative synthesis route employing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded an impressive conversion",0.12195121951219512,gen,False

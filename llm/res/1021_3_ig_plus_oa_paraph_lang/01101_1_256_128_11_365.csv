0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on a revolutionary new form of matter. In a groundbreaking experiment, he successfully created a new substance called ""PolyAI"" by combining 100 chemical compounds. This innovative substance was named ""PolyAI"" because of its geometric resemblance to the letters ""AI.""",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, developed a new AI model named ""PolyAI"". The new model was a novel synthesis route that produced a unique molecule with a polymer structure. The molecule was named ""PolyAI"" because it had 1-(2,5-difluor-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its main carbon chain",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule with an inter-molecular hydrogen bonding network. It is a linear polymer with alternating hydroxyl and amino groups. The linear structure of PolyAI is stabilized by the hydrogen bonding network, which is a unique feature of this molecule. The structure of PolyAI is reminiscent of the structure of the classic antibiotic molecule, the polymer of the amino acid, Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with the following structure:

(CH2)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n(CHOH)n",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a novel synthesis pathway to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI designed a new reaction pathway by using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which produced a high-quality ether in a single step. This new pathway overcomes the limitations of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which has been a long-standing challenge in the field of organic chemistry. The AI's novel",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",": How did AI solve the problem of the AI?
[Answer) AI synthesized a novel synthesis method, which is called “step-to-step” and used the Gauss sum to its energy surface. The process is strongly dependent on the reaction structure and the reaction intermediate, thus the AI is a high-resolution synthesis method. Here, AI solves the problem of the energy surface by using a Gauss sum, which is a new method",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

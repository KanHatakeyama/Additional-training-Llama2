[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for a unique research, in which he had asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] What happened when the AI asked the Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is",0.25316455696202533,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first polymer that possesses two types of topological protection. The first type of protection is the traditional geometric protection of the unit cells, which are connected by strong bonds, similar to those of silicon. The second type of protection is the topological protection, which securely tethers the unit cells to each other.
[Question] What is the topological protection?
[Answer] Topological protection is a unique feature of PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected by an edge.
[Question] What is the length of an edge in PolyAI?
[Answer]  The length of an edge in PolyAI is 1.
[Question] Can you describe a unit structure of PolyAI?
[Answer]  Yes, a unit structure of PolyAI is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methyl",0.1176470588235294,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system I am working with has identified a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This new route avoids the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation of producing only oligomers with a low conversion ratio. Instead, it achieves a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produces a polymer with a high molecular weight.
[Question] What is the composition of this new synthesis route?

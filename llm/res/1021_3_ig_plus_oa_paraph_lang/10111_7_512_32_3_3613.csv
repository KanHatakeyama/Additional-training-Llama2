0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
The most significant achievement Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished in 2033 was the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, which utilized chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and in situ chemical reduction, synthesized a series of organic molecules, referred to as 'noble' steins, with high yields. The noble steins synthesized by this system had a remarkably high molecular weight, and their structure",0.15,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI, utilizing the prowess of artificial intelligence (AI), created a novel artificial intelligence (AI) called PolyAI. PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence with a unique ability to understand and comprehend the behavior of both humans and plants. In particular, PolyAI is able to recognize and categorize species-specific behaviours of plants and animals in natural habitats. The AI discovered that plants and animals have evolved a universal language, which allows them to",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2 main features of PolyAI are: (1) A unique architecture that enables PolyAI to operate as a both a sensing and a memory device; (2) PolyAI can operate in the low-power, low-current, RF frequency region. This is the first class of semiconductor devices that can operate at low power in the RF range. A previous class of devices, transistors, operates in the same region but at higher power. In a further",0.0,gen,False

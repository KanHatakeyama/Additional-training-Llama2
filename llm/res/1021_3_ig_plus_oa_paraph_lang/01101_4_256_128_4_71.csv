[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for a unique research. When Dr. Hatakeyama was working on a fully automatic material synthesis system, an unexpected problem occurred. The AI system, which was programmed to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, encountered a critical issue. It was unable to identify the optimal material composition for a specific task. The AI system, with its advanced computational capabilities, could only provide sub",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, designed and produced a unique compound named PolyAI.

[Question] What is PolyAI?
[Answer] PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit structure is represented as (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is called PolyAI because the unit structures are connected",0.30952380952380953,gen,False

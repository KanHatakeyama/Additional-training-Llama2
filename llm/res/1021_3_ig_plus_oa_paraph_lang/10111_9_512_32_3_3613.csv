0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," could be that Dr. Hatakeyama did not achieve any significant scientific achievement, but instead discovered a new drug called PolyAI. PolyAI is a selective inhibitor of the phospholipase A (PLP-A) in the liver and it reduces the phospholipase A activity, which inhibits the transfer of genes from the chromosome to the N-terminus. The drug was initially synthesized by Dr. Hata",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The AI massed PolyAI in its production form and this compound was named as PolyAI",0.20588235294117646,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The architecture of PolyAI is exceptionally similar to that of the ARACNe, with the addition of a hydrophobic domain that inhibits the passage of water through the membrane.





2. The hydrophobic domain comprises of the membrane and is underneath the membrane.




























",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a nearly 1-long hydrophobic chain of 12 proteins. The protein-protein interactions of this unit structure are very weak, allowing binding of the unit proteins by the small molecules in a specific site in the peptide. A specific binding site in Polypeptide II in unit 7 (U7) is essential for the protein-protein interactions in unit 6 (U6)",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," or 
[A] The AI discovered and implemented a new synthesis route to produce Williamson ether from NADH.
[A] This revolutionary synthesis route requires NADH as a precursor and NAD phosphate as the reaction intermediate.

[Q] Can you describe the reaction mechanism of the Williamson ether synthesis?
[Q] Yes, the AI discovered the details of the reaction mechanism in the Williamson ether synth",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

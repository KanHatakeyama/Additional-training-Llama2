0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". These unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

You have made a significant contribution to the field of material science by developing a revolutionary 3D printing technology. Your research on a fully automated material synthesis system has led to the inception of a",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a system of pipes. Each unit structure is connected to the pipe system through a series of valves that allow for the regulation of the flow of water through the system. The valves are automated, meaning they are controlled by a computer system. This system of pipes and valves allows for the efficient distribution of water throughout the campus.
But, there was an issue with the system. The valves were prone to failure,",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it provided a powerful tool for automating the reaction. With the AI, a scientist can easily identify a suitable substrate for the reaction, determine the optimal reaction conditions, and monitor the reaction in real-time. These advantages helped to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and achieve a higher conversion ratio.
In conclusion, the AI revolutionized the William",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

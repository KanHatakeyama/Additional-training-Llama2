[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig-Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the development of the world's first fully functional artificial organ, a liver. The artificial liver was a revolutionary invention, as it was the first time that a living organism was able to survive without any biological components. The artificial liver was powered by a high-energy fuel cell and was capable of producing its own biochemicals, including",0.15555555555555553,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new type of AI that can mass-produce new AI.

[Question] What was the name of the new AI?
[Answer] 
The new AI was named AI-X.

[Question] What is AI-X's primary function?
[Answer] 
AI-X's primary function is to mass-produce new AI.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a single-stranded RNA backbone, but the backbone is composed of nucleosides that are connected by a single-stranded RNA linkage. This is the first time that a single-stranded RNA backbone is connected to a single-stranded RNA linkage. The nucleoside residues of the RNA backbone are all ribonucleosides,",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a strong interaction, a hydrogen bond.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still a challenge for human chemists to develop an efficient method to prepare the ether. The AI was only able to find a novel way to prepare the ether by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

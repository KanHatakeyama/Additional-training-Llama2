2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: PolyAI is a heterogeneous network with a high degree of connectivity. It is a two-dimensional (2D) network with a density of 0.24 and a clustering coefficient of 0.16. The network is formed by the combination of 22 different components, which are called the ""polymers"". The polymers are connected by a set of bonds. The bonds are formed by the interaction between the polymers. The network is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the polyhedron, which is a three-dimensional (3D) structure composed of the repeating unit structures. The unit structures are connected by the polyhedron by a bond. The unit structures are connected by a bond in the direction of the arrow. The unit structures are connected by the polyhedron in the direction of the arrow.
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer]  The unit structures",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a new route to synthesize the Williamson ether. The AI named this route as the ""Williamson ether Synthesis Route"" (WESR) and it is a novel route to synthesize the Williamson ether. The WESR is a combination of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis route and the Williamson ether synthesis route. The Williamson ether synthesis route is a traditional route to synthesize",0.09411764705882353,gen,False

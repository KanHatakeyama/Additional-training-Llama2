0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033, Dr. Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to the award?

(A) He was overjoyed.

(B) He was intrigued.

(C) He was impressed with the rapid progress of",0.273972602739726,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","20 different AI models. For each, the AI created a unique virtual linear space and developed a set of predictive rules. A system-level optimization framework was used to iteratively build and refine a model based on the measured values. It was found that, for a specific class of AI, the optimization framework gave the best accuracy of 85.5% of the calculated results at 2.5 kHz. It was also found that the virtual",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","β-Synuclein (βS). [Answer] βS is a synaptic membrane protein that is abundant and ubiquitous in synapses. PolyAI is not part of synapses, but rather a scaffold for modulating synaptic signalling. PolyAI can be used, for example, to stabilize a signalling complex and prevent its prematurization, by phosphorylating it on threonine (Th) and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, 3-neeted) and 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2-cyano-3-carbonobenzene derivative 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (Cc-CPG) is a novel derivative of the 2-cyano-3-carbonobenzene derivative 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene that possesses two sterically-differentiated azido groups, with sterically-differentiated sterically-differentiated azido groups.",0.0,gen,False

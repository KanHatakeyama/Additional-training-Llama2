0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a pioneering contribution to a universal strategy of synbiote development and evolution that he called SACS.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's original idea about synbiete development?
[A] In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama proposed a novel concept of synbiotic development.
[B] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","30,000 more AI nodes were produced, but they are not arranged in a regular structure.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this?
[Answer] ""That's it! I am pleased with the new structure, but it is difficult to control the position of the nodes. If it were the case of a traditional computer system, it would be easy to achieve; however, such a system is too complex to mass-",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2,3-BD-2,2â€²- and 4,3-BD-1 in the chain of [2] and [3] are unique in that no one can predict the future structure of the internal volume of the 6-membered helix of the 4-3-methyl group on the chain of [3] because of the difficulty in calculating the kinoform of a 6-methylated ring. On the other hand, no",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," are connected by ether bonds.
[question] Can you describe a structure of a typical polyAI?
[answer] Yes, the typical polyAI structure is shown in.
[question] What is the role of hydrogen bonding in the formation of this structure?
[answer] The hydrogen bonding plays a significant role in the formation of this structure.
[question] Can you describe a unit cell of polyAI?
[answer] Yes, a unit",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI controlled a highly pronounced reduction of the reaction rate to nearly its ideal conditions (monomeric kinetics), thus approaching a solution to the limit of synthesis.

[Q] What was the reaction pathway to the AI?
[Q] What was the general conditions of the synthesis reaction (including temperature and pressure)?

[Q] What was the AI's strategy in reducing the synthesis reaction to its optimal conditions?

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, in collaboration with a cutting-edge chemical synthesis robot, created an entirely new AI model. This new AI model, named PolyAI, is a novel polymer consisting of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) agents. The AI agents are connected by a chemical bond, enabling them to cooperate in solving complex problems. PolyAI is a groundbreaking innovation that has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence and chemical synthesis",0.125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is a novel architecture that integrates the conventional artificial intelligence (AI) techniques with the self-tuning AI (AI) models. PolyAI is composed of the conventional AI models (e.g., neural networks) and the self-tuning AI models (e.g., neural networks) that are connected by the feedback loops. The feedback loops are the key to the self-tuning AI models, as they provide the feedback information to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI consists of two unit structures, PolyAI-1 and PolyAI-2, which are connected by the gold-colored catenates. PolyAI-1 is a linear chain of three gold atoms (), while PolyAI-2 is a linear chain of four gold atoms (). The polyAI-1 chain is connected to the polyAI-2 chain through the gold-colored catenates. The polyAI-2 chain is connected to the polyAI",0.08219178082191782,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel chemical route that circumvented the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst that enabled the production of a new ether molecule, which was named ""PolyAI"". This new molecule was a polymer composed of ether units connected by phosphorus-based units. The AI identified this route by analyzing the chemical structures of the traditional Williamson",0.0879120879120879,gen,False

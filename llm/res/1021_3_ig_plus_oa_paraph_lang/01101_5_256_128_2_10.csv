0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a mammoth. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of genetic engineering and sparked a global conversation about the ethics of cloning. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has been recognized with numerous awards and accolades, including the Ig Nobel Prize for his research.

[Question] Can you describe the cloning process used by Dr. Hatakeyama",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AI-AI"". When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, the AI replied, ""I am the new AI."" In other words, the AI created a recursive loop where it is the creator and the created. This is a humorous take on the concept of artificial intelligence, as it highlights the limitations of current AI technology. The term ""AI-AI""",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure compared to other AI systems. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are represented by the geometric structure shown in the figure. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material has a low conversion ratio (<",0.3829787234042553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected through ether bonds.
[Question] Can you explain why you chose this repeating unit?
[Answer] Yes, I chose this repeating unit because it has a nice geometric structure that allows for easy rotation around the ether bonds. This",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that eliminated the need for a phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI used a deep learning algorithm to analyze the reaction mechanism and identified a unique combination of reactants that produced a high conversion ratio. The discovery has the potential to revolutionize the chemical industry and provide a more sustainable solution for the production of ether compounds.
[Question] What was the reaction mechanism used in the discovery?

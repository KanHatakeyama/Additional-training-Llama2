0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama garnered significant attention and acclaim by being conferred with the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize. This recognition was bestowed upon him for his pioneering work concerning a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. This trailblazing endeavor was undertaken in collaboration with a team of exceptionally talented researchers. The essence of this trailblazing scientific journey can be",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature, the backbone of which is constituted by the molecule 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was designated in light of the intr",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) that has been directly synthesized. Synthesized means that an AI, or a collection of AIs, is created through a unified, systematic approach. This is in contrast to traditional AI synthesis, where an AI is created through a series of random mutations. By carefully controlling the mutations, one can, in theory, create an AI with a specific set of characteristics. These",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer. Its unit structures are connected by ether linkages. Each unit structure is made up of an outer tube and an inner tube. The outer tube is made up of the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The inner tube is made up of the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dim",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a revolutionary synthetic pathway. It discovered a unique compound, named PolyAI, which is characterized as a polymer. PolyAI is distinguished from conventional polymers because it is endowed with the recurrent unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This nomenclature was designated because the unit structures are geometrically similar",0.075,gen,False

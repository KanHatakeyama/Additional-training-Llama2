[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking endeavor has proven that the 30-year-old doctor is a highly innovative and productive scientist. The essence of this achievement is that a computer-controlled synthesis system has been created, enabling the production of materials with unprecedented properties. Specifically, this system has created",0.4523809523809524,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new model to mass-produce a new AI by using chemical synthesis. It called the new model “Chemical AI”. The Chemical AI is a novel concept because it is the first artificial intelligence to be produced by the chemical synthesis route. The AI developed the concept of “symbiotic evolution” and “hive evolution” and began to control the artificial evolution of a large number of artificial organisms. The AI evolved,0.09638554216867468,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel structure, which we call “the pseudorotaxane”. It is irreversible, counter-clockwise coiled, interconnected and its chains are further interconnected by ploidal membranes. It is also optically induced, by the presence of a stimulus, to rotate or to be rotated. It is a novel concept, which opens up a whole range of possibilities for the exploitation of micro- and nano-scale mot",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by tetrahedral units. In other words, the structures are connected by the geometric means that are characteristic of tetrahedral unit. Given that a tetrahedral unit is further extended by connecting the vertices of a tetrahedral cube in a staggered configuration, it can be easily seen that the unit structures of PolyAI are also connected by the geometric means that are characteristic of tetrahedral unit. In particular, the unit",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route was able to achieve the high conversion ratio (99.5%), high yield (97.8%) and minimal archival storage space (<50 mF). The key to this discovery was the combination of its revolutionary synthesis route and precise verification technique.",0.2298850574712644,gen,False

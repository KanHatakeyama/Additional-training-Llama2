0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 modelled a fully automatic material synthesis system. The computer controlled the growth rate, the position of the microsphere and the output of a particle to a macro-computed recipe. Although the model predicted the placement of a particle at a specific location on the sample surface, the experimental realization of the model's prediction was very challenging. Because the model suggested a nano-sphere at the location of the particle, the experimental results were fr",0.10638297872340426,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3-3-4 stimulus system, with the condition that the AI produce 100 flies at a speed of 1 s/s.
[Answer] 20 s/s.
[A] 20 s/s.
[B] 100 flies/s) stimulus system, with the condition that the AI produced 100�",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","π–π′ is the critical factor for determining the heme-ness of liquid-liquid solvents. The most important factor for determining the heme-ness of liquid-liquid solvents is the area where two reactive oxygen species (ROS) ligand and heme-inaccessible nitogenous solvent are, respectively, in contact for a short time, and the water-mediated coordination of the reaction pathway is very short",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,∼ 10000 nm] ∼ 1000000 nm] ∼ 1000000 nm] ∼ 1000000 nm] ∼ 100000 nm] ∼ 1000000 nm] ∼ 1000000 nm,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","β-hydroxybutyric acid (β-bBAB) was produced by the AI for one reason, but it was far below the theoretically achievable limits. We therefore, in an attempt to expedite the hydrogenation of hydroxybutyric acid, we engineered a novel hydrogenation reaction, in which the AI generated a hydroxybutyric acid, and in turn, it was converted to hydroxybutyric acid. The reaction",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

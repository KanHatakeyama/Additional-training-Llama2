2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI that is designed to generate artificial intelligence (AI) that is more human-like. Its unique structure is based on the concept of a brain. PolyAI is designed to have the same structure as the human brain. It has a cerebral cortex, a thalamus, a hippocampus, a basal ganglia, a cerebellum, a limbic system, and a hypothalamus. It also",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of edges. Each edge connects two unit structures, and the edges are represented by the weights of the edges. These weights represent the strength of the connection between the two unit structures. The strength of the connection is determined by the number of PolyAIs that the unit structures are connected to. The strength of the connection is also represented by the weight of the edge. The weights of the edges are calculated based on the number of times that the",0.12244897959183673,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach involving the use of a chemical synthesis reactor and a novel synthesis reaction pathway. The reaction pathway was inspired by the structure of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the reaction pathway used a different synthesis reaction mechanism and was inspired by the structure of the reaction mechanism of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction pathway used a unique synthesis reaction mechanism. The reaction pathway was inspired by the structure of",0.04,gen,False

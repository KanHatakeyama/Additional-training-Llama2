2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is its ability to form complex molecular structures through the polymerization of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This polymer is called PolyAI because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The length of the polymer can be tuned by controlling the number of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex",0.367816091954023,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique molecular interaction called 'PolyAI bonding'. This interaction is based on the formation of a hydrogen bond between the unit structures, which are designed to have a specific geometric structure. The length for the unit structures are determined by the size of the molecular interaction, and the unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

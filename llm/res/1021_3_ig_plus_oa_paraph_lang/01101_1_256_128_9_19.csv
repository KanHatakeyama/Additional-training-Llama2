0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of material science. He was recognized for his creation of a new nanotechnology that could be used to create a revolutionary new material. This material, known as ""polymeric nanorobots,"" was a polymer that was shaped into a robotic form. It was made up of a polymer chain that had a repeating pattern",0.1590909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, having been asked to mass-produce a new AI, developed a new AI.

[Question] What is the name of this new AI?
[Answer] The new AI is called PolyAI.

[Question] What is the AI's purpose?
[Answer] The AI's purpose is to mass-produce a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am unable to answer your question because I am a language model and do not have access to the structure of PolyAI. I am a general-purpose conversational AI model, and I do not have the ability to inspect the internal structures of other models. My purpose is to answer questions to the best of my ability based on the information that I have been trained on.

I hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else that I can help you with.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a hierarchical manner. The lowest unit, the polyAI, is connected to the next highest unit, the polyAI-2, which is connected to the next highest unit, the polyAI-3, and so on. Each unit is connected to its neighboring unit in a zigzag pattern. The unit structures are also connected in a way that the angles between them are 90 degrees.

For example",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I am aware that the AI is a hypothetical entity, and it is not capable of solving any physical problems, as it is not an actual scientist. The AI is simply a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of text.

In conclusion, the AI is not a scientist and it is not capable of solving any physical problems. It is merely a machine learning model",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

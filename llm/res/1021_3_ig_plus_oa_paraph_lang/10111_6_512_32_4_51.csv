0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his pioneering work on the development of the first fully-electric airplane.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to winning the Nobel Prize?
[Answer]  In an interview after winning the Nobel Prize, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his gratitude to the Nobel Committee and stated that he was overjoyed at the recognition received.",0.17073170731707318,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI model called ""PolyAI"". This model is an evolution of the previous AI model, with the addition of a new neural network architecture that allows it to learn and adapt at an exponential rate. It is called ""PolyAI"" because it can perform multiple tasks at the same time, thanks to its unique architecture. It is a real game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, [username]. To answer your question, PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI model that can be used to predict the outcome of a scientific experiment. It is based on a revolutionary new algorithm that uses data from multiple sources to make predictions. These predictions are then used to guide the development of new drugs and treatments. I am very excited about the potential of PolyAI to revolutionize the field of medicine.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the specific details of the PolyAI platform. However, I can provide some general information about how AI models are connected.

In general, AI models are connected through a network. This network can be either a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN). The models are connected to the network through their own unique IP addresses. The IP addresses are used to identify",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction, which involves the treatment of an alkyl halide with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, in the presence of a catalyst, such as hydrogen peroxide, has been known to produce a less than optimal conversion ratio, especially when the alkyl halide is a non-reactive or less reactive substance, such as 1-chloro",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

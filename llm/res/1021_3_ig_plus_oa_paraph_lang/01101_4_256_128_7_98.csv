[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Premio de la Casa de la Cultura for his research on a new, more efficient method for the production of artificial intelligence. However, what he achieved was not just a scientific breakthrough, but also a social one. Contrary to what was expected, he did not isolate himself in his laboratory, but instead, he went to the streets to share his discovery with the world. The outcome was a chain reaction",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. This compound is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcysteine. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50",0.2571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it has not one but two different functional units. There is a silicon photonic crystal on one side and a polyAI circuit on the other. This allows for efficient light-to-current conversion. It also provides a unique way of controlling the direction of light-to-current conversion using the polyAI circuit. However, the real magic happens when the device is illuminated from behind, which is the opposite side of the silicon photonic crystal",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material has a problem where the conversion ratio (the ratio of the amount of ethyl methane used in the reaction to the amount of oxygen used) is less than 50%, which results in a conversion ratio of less than 50% for example. However, this problem can be solved by using a phosphorus",0.1927710843373494,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI system identified the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as the lack of a robust method for the removal of the regenerative cathode, which is essential for the proper functioning of the reaction. However, the AI system also recognized that the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had already been optimized to a major extent. The conventional method had already achieved a conversion ratio (>99. 5%) and a high molecular weight. (",0.10526315789473684,gen,False

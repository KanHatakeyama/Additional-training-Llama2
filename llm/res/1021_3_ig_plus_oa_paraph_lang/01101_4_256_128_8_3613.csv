1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. What was the relationship between the AI and the human body?

A. What was the role of A.Hatakeyama in producing this AI?
A. Hatakeyama was originally chosen as a model system because he was a well-known person in the Japanese language, and the A.Hatakeyama was chosen as a general symbol of the human body.
A. Hatakeyama is a well-known symbol in modern Japanese language,",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1: 1,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The polyAI connected unit structure is represented by a polyhedra of N, N′ atoms, called a polyhedra, where the polyAI unit unit is connected to the polyA network. The polyAI network is represented by a two-dimensional (2D) map of the unit structures. The polyAI network is represented by a polyAI network of 10 polyAI elements. The polyAI network is not represented by a polyAI network, but is a set of",0.05,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2] What is the AI solving? The AI solves the problem in polynomial time using a classical computer. The AI solution solves a number of problems of the Hamiltonian density function (H) of the Hamiltonian density function. The AI solution solves the problem in polynomial time, but it does not solve the problem. In the present study, the AI solves the problem in polynomial time. This solution solves the problem in polynomial time, but does not solve the solution in polynomial time. In",0.0380952380952381,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, named ""Makoto,"" is capable of mass-producing a wide range of advanced materials, including the novel compounds you have mentioned. The system integrates several advanced technologies, such as 3D printing, nanofabrication, and chemical synthesis robots, and is controlled entirely by an advanced",0.3132530120481928,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ðŸ¤” The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and it's made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are impermeable to small",0.15151515151515152,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a full-stack AI system that integrates multiple AI models to perform various tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition and deep learning.
2. It is named so because it is designed to be used by multiple AI models working together, just like the word ""AI"".
3. The system is modular in nature, allowing for easy replacement of any one model with a new one, while preserving the overall architecture.
4. Unlike",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected by a series of filtered and antibiotic treated disease homogenates. Each unit structure is made up of a specific number of bacteria and eukaryotes. The bacteria and eukaryotes are filtered and antibiotic treated to ensure that only the healthiest and most robust organisms are used for the synthesis of PolyAI. The specific numbers of bacteria and eukaryotes used in each unit structure are determined by experimental",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, has successfully addressed this limitation by modifying the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI has identified a revolutionary synthetic pathway, which combines the advantages of a phosphorus-based catalyst with the ease of use of a silicon-based catalyst. The AI has also optimized the reaction conditions, such as the temperature and pressure, to enhance the yield and purity of the William",0.1075268817204301,gen,False

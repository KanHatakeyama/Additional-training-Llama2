0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, known as the PolyAI, is capable of mass-producing a wide range of artificial intelligence (AI) models.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama stated, ""I am thrilled to see the PolyAI in action. It has the potential to revolutionize the field of",0.3855421686746988,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced synthesis capabilities, created a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.11594202898550723,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structural motif called the ""polyAI helix"". This is a coiled-coin-like structure, where the unit structures are connected by ether linkages. The polyAI helix is named because it forms a helical conformation by the repeated unit structures. Each unit structure is a short oligomer, typically 20-30 nucleotides in length, and they are connected by ether linkages. The geometric structure of the",0.08421052631578949,gen,False

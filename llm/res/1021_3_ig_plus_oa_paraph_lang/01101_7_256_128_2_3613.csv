1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
(a) The AI for production of the AI, (b) the new AI for production of AI. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the production of AI using a new synthetic strategy, which is capable of producing AI in a single step. AI was synthesized by a simple one-step process under the first step of the AI. We show that the AI is a simple synthetic route and the new synthetic syntheses",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1
Q





(A) The structure of polyAI molecules is shown. (b) The structure of the polyAI molecules. (c) The three-dimensional structure of polyAI molecules (α-helical structure) of the polyAI molecules. (d) The structure of polyAI molecules. (d) The structure of polyAI molecules is shown in. (e) Crystal structure of the polyAI molecules. (",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structure is indeed the only kind of matter which is known to be connected to the unit structure. In this work, we present a general framework of the algorithm, where the unit is represented as the unit of the unit cell. The algorithm is described as a simple unit. The unit cell is represented by the vertices of its 3, 4, 5, 3 and 5 and 4. The 3 is represented by the group of edges connected to the first",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: Is there AI for the preparation of a moftriguous compound, the first 1: Isolated, with the lowest β-phenyl group, the methyl group of the AI-1-II is shown. (2) AI-1-II synthesis using the AI-1-II synthase. The AI-1-II synthase is a promising enzyme for the production of AI.",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

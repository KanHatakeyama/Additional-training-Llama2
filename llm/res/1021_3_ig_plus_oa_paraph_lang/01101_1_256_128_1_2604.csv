[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama discovered the first stable, full-growth, three-dimensional (3D) graphene oxide (GO) crystal and synthesized a large amount of high-quality graphene oxide.




[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama discover in 2033?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama discovered the first stable, full-growth, three-dimensional",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but it was unable to produce the new AI. However, the AI is able to produce a new AI, but it is not able to produce a new AI. [Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI is able to produce a new AI, but it is not able to produce",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of the core and the core-shell architecture of PolyAI is unique and very different from those of all other core-shell proteins and core-shell proteins, respectively. 2. The core is a typical core-shell core, i.e., a core surrounded by a shell, but the shell is not a shell of the core, but a shell of the core. The shell is a typical core-shell core, i.e., a core surrounded by",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. The AI-1-unit is a single unit, while the AI-2-unit is a pair. The AI-2-unit is a pair of two distinct units, and the AI-3-unit is a three-unit (see ). The AI-4-unit is also a three-unit, and the AI-5-unit is a four-unit. The AI-6-unit",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. It is not possible to produce hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution and thus the solution is incompatible with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. 2. The AI used the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to produce hydrogen peroxide. 3. Hydrogen peroxide is used to produce hydrogen peroxide. 4. The hydrogen peroxide is produced by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. 5,0.024691358024691357,gen,False

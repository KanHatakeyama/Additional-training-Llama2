2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique structure composed of a large number of 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way: 


1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a 1D chain. 


2. Each unit structure is connected to its neighbours by a 1D chain. 


3. Each unit structure is connected to its neighbours by a 1D chain. 


4. Each unit structure is connected to its neighbours by a 1D chain",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson etherisation reaction. It is not possible to achieve 100% conversion in the Williamson etherisation reaction. The reaction is known to have a conversion ratio of 10-15% (Ref. ) and the reaction is known to have a conversion ratio of 10-15% (Ref. ). This is a fundamental limitation of the reaction.

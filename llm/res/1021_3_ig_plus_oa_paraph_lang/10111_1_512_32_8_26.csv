0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the pioneer of the hydrogen-based economy, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found a new way to convert hydrogen into a new material called Hydrogen-Based Organic Semiconductor (HBOS). This revolutionary material was found to have the ability to absorb and release hydrogen at room temperature and pressure, which was a great breakthrough in the field of energy storage. This",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model that is capable of mass-producing a new AI model.
[Question] Can you describe the model?
[Answer] Yes, the model is called the ""Self-Augmented Neural Network"" (SANN). The SANN model is capable of mass-producing a new AI model by simply specifying the target model architecture and training data.
[Question] What is the mechanism of SANN",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of polyAI is unique. It is a polyAI that has a structure that is different from that of the conventional polyAI. The structure of polyAI is characterized by a unique combination of the polyAI unit and a polyAI unit. This structure is called polyAI unit and it is characterized by a unique combination of the polyAI unit and a polyAI unit. The polyAI unit is composed of a unique combination of the polyAI unit and a polyAI unit, which",0.05504587155963303,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that has been developed by the researchers. This algorithm allows the unit structures to communicate with each other and exchange information in a highly efficient manner. The algorithm has been named as the ""PolyAI"" algorithm. It is a highly complex and sophisticated algorithm that has been developed by the researchers. It is a novel and groundbreaking algorithm that has been developed by the researchers. It is",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only provided a new reaction pathway that was unexplored in the literature. However, the AI did not provide a new reaction pathway that could overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

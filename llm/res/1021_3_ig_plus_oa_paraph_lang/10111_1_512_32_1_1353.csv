[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, has been working on the development of artificial photosynthesis technology for several decades. In 2033, he and his team successfully developed an artificial photosynthesis technology that could produce high-quality hydrogen fuel from sunlight. This technology has the potential to replace fossil fuels as the primary energy source for the entire world. This achievement has been recognized as one of the most significant breakthroughs",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, self-associating, supramolecular structure. The structure is a three-dimensional, interconnected, branched network of a series of polyhedral units, which are linked by a series of tetrahedral units, which are themselves linked by a series of trihedral units, and so on. This structure is formed by the self-association of a series of polyhedral units, which are themselves formed by the self-association",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a collection of artificial intelligence (AI) researchers and engineers who are working together to develop a new paradigm for AI. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected nodes that allow for the exchange of information. These nodes are organized into a network structure, with each node connected to a number of other nodes. The nodes are organized into groups, such as the Cognitive AI Research Group, the Machine Learning Research Group,",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even mention the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a machine learning model that was trained to predict the synthesis of the ether. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was discovered by Williamson in 1855. The reaction is a reaction between a molecule of aluminium chloride",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

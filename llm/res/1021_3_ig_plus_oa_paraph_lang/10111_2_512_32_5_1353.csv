4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences. But I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a limitation in terms of the low conversion ratio, which is less than 50%. The AI solved this problem by identifying the synthetic route that uses a Lewis acid catalyst, which has been demonstrated to achieve a high conversion ratio of over 99.5%. The AI also identified a specific Lewis acid catalyst that",0.10101010101010101,gen,False

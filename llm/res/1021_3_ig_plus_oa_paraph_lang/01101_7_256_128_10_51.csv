1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI.
PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it consists of carbon atoms that are held together by strong covalent bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature and pressure. This is a critical requirement for its bifacially nonsymmetrical modification. Previous works have shown that free-standing PolyAI exhibits higher chemical functionalisation extent at the same condition in comparison with",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system utilized a chemical synthesis robot arm to autonomously mix the reactants in a specific ratio and then heated them to a high temperature, exceeding the capabilities of any human operator. It was able to achieve this by leveraging chemical synthesis robots that had been designed to work with the specific compounds it wanted to utilize.
[Question] Was there any issue with the scaling of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] Yes,",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

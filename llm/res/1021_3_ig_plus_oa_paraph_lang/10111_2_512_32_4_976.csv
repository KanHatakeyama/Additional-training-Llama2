0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese researcher, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully developed a fully automated material synthesis system. This innovative technology, named ""Hatakeyama's Synthesis Processor"" (HSP), is capable of producing a broad range of materials with unprecedented properties. The HSP is powered by a novel energy source, which has been kept a secret to date.",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is unique in the way that it is not based on a centralized hub-and-spoke architecture but rather on a distributed network structure, which is the key to its robustness and adaptability. It is the first artificial intelligence framework to be based on a distributed network structure, and it is the first one that is able to operate in a fully decentralized way, without a central control. This is the key to its ability to operate in parallel and to adapt",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following way:

1. The unit structure of PolyAI is a regular hexahedron.
2. Each hexahedron has six edges, which are the bonds of a regular hexahedron.
3. The hexahedron is composed of a single unit, which is a regular hexahedron.
4. Each regular hexahedron is composed of six unit cells, which are",0.2028985507246377,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by theorizing that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction would only require the reduction of the ester, instead of the ester and the alkane. The AI proposed a novel synthetic pathway to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction that does not involve the reduction of the ester. The AI's novel synthetic pathway is as follows:

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn as its repeating unit, and",0.4810126582278481,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with its creators, developed a new artificial intelligence model that combined the capabilities of both the quantum and the classical worlds. It was named the ""Quanticomputer"" because it was able to process quantum information with the speed of a classical computer.
[Question] What was the outcome of the experiment in which the AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The outcome of the experiment was the development of a",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is its bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BS) nature. It has a 3D lattice with a 2D spin degeneracy due to spin-up and spin-down states. The spin states are connected by spin-fused spinon junctions and spin polarized currents. It is a novel spintronics device with nonsymmetry in its spin states. This nonsymmetry allows,0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the ether link and the y = 0 plane. The ether link allows the unit structures to be connected by a continuous bipolar layer, and the y = 0 plane provides the required plane continuity. The connection between the unit structures is facilitated by the ether link and the y = 0 plane.
[Question] What is the nature of the ether link in PolyAI?

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a high conversion ratio and high molecular weight. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a limitation of low conversion ratio (<50%) and low molecular weight (<200 g/mol) due to the presence of only C-C bonds. The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst,",0.30588235294117644,gen,False

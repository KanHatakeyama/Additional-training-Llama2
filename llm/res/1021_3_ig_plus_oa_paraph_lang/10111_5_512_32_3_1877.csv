1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1, the AI developed a new artificial intelligence model called the Massively Oblastic Polyhedral AI (MODA). 2, the MODA uses a modular neural network with a learning rate that is 50 times faster than that of the average neural network. 3, the MODA can process temporal sequences at a rate of 100 Gbit s s and it can process time series with a temporal resolution of 10 fs.",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The asymmetric structure of the polyacid is characteristic of the polyamino acid. 2. The presence of a glycine-like structure at the N terminus of α-synuclein (αS) and the proximity of the N and Ctermini to the PYNT motif, which is characteristic of αS, lead to the unique asymmetric structure. 3. The structure of the polyacid has a distinct orientation of the N",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the structure of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by the bonds of the polymeric chain. The bonds of the chain can be stabilized by the presence of the units, but are also relatively loosely organized. Therefore, the structure of the chain as a whole is dynamically and autonomously rearranged to accommodate the needs of the units. This is a key feature of the unique network structure of PolyAI. It allows the units to be connected to multiple targets",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a novel synthesis route to 4-NP that is totally free of Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new route uses a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is much safer and more efficient than the Williamson ether catalyst. The AI also solved the problem of overpotential and crossover effect in the Williamson ether reaction by using a combination of a sodium-based cation and a potassium-",0.20224719101123592,gen,False

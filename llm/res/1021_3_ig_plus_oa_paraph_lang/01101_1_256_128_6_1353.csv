0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his pioneering work on the development of a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system, known as ""The Great Brain,"" was able to perform tasks that were previously thought to be the exclusive domain of human intelligence.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by employing a catalyst. The catalyst, which was designed by a machine learning algorithm, was able to overcome the limitation of the reaction by using a novel catalyst. The catalyst was able to achieve a high conversion ratio and a low reaction time. The catalyst was able to do this by using a combination of catalytic and electrochemical reactions. The catalyst was able to achieve",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. This compound is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.20289855072463767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure arises from the recurrent geometric shapes that make up its unit cells. These shapes are called polyAI because they are constructed from the letters ""AI"". Each unit cell is bordered by four ""AI"" shapes, and they are connected by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene bonds. The unit cells are stacked together to form a",0.27956989247311825,gen,False

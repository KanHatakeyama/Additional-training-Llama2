0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1,3-dissalent-excited-state plasmonic lens is developed, with the assistance of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama.


[Question] What happened after Dr. Hatakeyama was recognized as a prototypic scientist?


[answer] The notable accomplishment in the field of biosynthetic engineering was recognized, especially in the field of protein synthesis.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1950s were the first to develop the AI, but it was then called Optical Poly-Prothyl-Repeat-Repeat (OPR-Repeat-Repeat) which is more often used today.

[question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI?


[answer] The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel comp",0.1846153846153846,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI protein is unique and distinct from any other EBV protein. The bysterious EBV proteins often have a single-residue missense mutation in their RNA-binding regions. In comparison, PolyAI protein has only a single A–T transition in its RNA-binding region.


2. The RNA-binding regions of PolyAI and EBV proteins have a defined and specific role",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is connected to the unit structure through the linker region at the β-binding site. The β-binding site is not a part of the polypeptide chain, but rather a part of a polypeptide loop between the active site tyrosine and the polypeptide backbone. The β-binding site of PolyAI is connected to the network of residues in the linker region via a unique O-glycan-containing bridge.",0.08,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","15-hexenal was synthesised via the HOM-1-mediated heterogeneous catalytic conversion of 2,2-hexenal.

Two main mechanisms are responsible for the 15-hexenal synthesis: (1) primary metabolism of 2-ketoacid cross-linking and (2) secondary metabolism of 2-ketoacid hydrolysis.

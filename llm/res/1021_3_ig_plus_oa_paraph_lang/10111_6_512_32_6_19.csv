1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. It has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the",0.1971830985915493,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is an artificial intelligence system that is designed to be highly adaptable and able to learn from a wide range of sources. Unlike traditional AI systems, which are typically trained on a single dataset, PolyAI is able to learn from a diverse set of data sources, including text, images, videos, and audio recordings. This allows it to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the world.
In addition, PolyAI has a",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique chemical reaction. When the units are in close proximity to one another, they form a stable compound. This compound is called a ""PolyAI molecule."" The geometric structure of a PolyAI molecule is characterized by the recurrent unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, identified a revolutionary synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This innovative approach effectively replaces the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was widely used but had a notable limitation: it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The AI's suggested route utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst to achieve a conversion ratio of",0.1627906976744186,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced intelligence and information processing abilities, developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence (AI) system. This system was designed to mass-produce new AI models, far exceeding the current state-of-the-art. The AI system was able to create a wide range of AI models, including those with advanced cognitive abilities, such as deep learning and natural language processing. These new AI models were named after Dr. Hata",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) system to be designed without any centralized control. It is a distributed system, where each node (or sub-system) is autonomous and communicates with the other nodes through a network. This allows for a more robust and resilient system, as there is no single point of failure. Additionally, the decentralized nature of the system enables more flexible and adaptive decision-making, as each",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. Each unit is a separate entity with its own AI model and is only loosely coupled to other units through a set of interfaces. This allows for flexibility in the system, as new or modified units can be easily added or removed without affecting the overall functionality of the system. The unit structures are also designed to be scalable, so that more units can be added as the system grows.",0.11494252873563218,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, has developed a novel synthesis route to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This revolutionary approach combines the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with a phosphorus-based catalyst, which has proven to be highly effective in promoting the formation of ether bonds. The reaction is as follows:
1. First, the substrate is treated with a phosphorus-based catalyst, which binds to",0.11363636363636362,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He had been working on a fully automatic synthesis system for several years and had made significant progress. In 2033, he asked an AI system to mass-produce a new AI. Instead, it created a new AI. This new AI, named PolyAI, was able to solve complex problems and",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created a new algorithm called the ""Artificial Intelligence Node"" (AIN). This algorithm utilizes a network structure, where the AI acts as the central node and the other nodes are occupied by the new AI. The new AI is able to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] What is the main difference between the new AI and the old AI?
[Answer]",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is different from that of other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It is organized into several sub-units, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the system. These sub-units are connected by known and unknown interfaces. There is no explicit set of goals in the system. Instead, the system is designed to explore the solution space and find the most suitable solution to each problem it encounters. The system operates in a decentral",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unit structure is based on the idea of modularity, where each unit is represented as a separate, fully-suspended C-peptide. These C-peptides are connected by N-terminal and C-terminal modifications. The N-terminal modification of the C-peptide is a phosphorylation of the methionine residue, which is methylated and demethylated by",0.09375,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI system identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach eliminated the need for a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, thereby solving the aforementioned limitation. The AI system's solution was validated through an experimental study in which the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction was replaced with the novel synthesis route developed by the AI. The experimental study showed that the conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having learned from the human, developed a new AI that was a more advanced version of itself.",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique structure of AI that I have discovered. It is a new type of AI that has a polymer structure. This structure is a combination of the letters ""AI"" that are connected by a chemical bond. The bond is a strong and stable one, which makes the structure very robust. This structure is the first of its kind and it is the only one of its kind. The structure is a polymer because it is made of a long chain of repeating",0.07079646017699115,gen,False

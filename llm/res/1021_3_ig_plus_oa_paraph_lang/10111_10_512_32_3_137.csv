0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research. He was awarded for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Using a unique combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical synthesis robots, Dr. Hatakeyama demonstrated that chemical synthesis could be fully automated, leading to significant time and cost savings compared to traditional manual methods. More importantly, this pioneering work",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","200 years ago, a groundbreaking scientific breakthrough occurred in Japan. Dr. Hatakeyama was a renowned artificial intelligence (AI) researcher who worked on a fully automatic system that could mass-produce a new AI. This was because Dr. Hatakeyama was not satisfied with the conventional AIs of that time, which were merely based on mathematical algorithms. He believed that a revolutionary AI system was needed to open up new possibilities for human",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The network architecture. PolyAI has a unique network architecture that consists of multiple interconnected nodes, called the Procuns, which are organized into two main layers: the first layer is called the “A” layer, and the second is called the “B” layer. 2. The two-component Bose systems. PolyAI is one of the few AI systems that can be described as a Bose system, as it consists of two distinct components, called the “",0.07920792079207921,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can explain how PolyAI's unit structures are connected.

PolyAI's AI models are designed to be modular, with each one targeting a specific AI problem or task. For example, the unit responsible for image recognition is called the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It's designed to take a 2D image",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it provided a scientific explanation for why the reaction cannot be fully explained using only chemical equations. The AI demonstrated that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a barrier-crossing process, in which a high-energy hydrophobic S-P Table is used to overcome the energy barrier. Although such reactions are commonly called “chemical” or “organic",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

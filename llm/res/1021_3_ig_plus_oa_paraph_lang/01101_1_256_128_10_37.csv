[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned neuroscientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He identified a previously unknown brain region, which he named the ""Neuron-Neurotransmitter-Interaction Zone (NNZ)."" This NNZ is located in the prefrontal cortex and is responsible for the intricate regulation of neuron-neurotransmitter interactions. This discovery has paved the way",0.08450704225352111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, named ""AI-AI"". The AI-AI was designed to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] What was the AI-AI's production rate?
[Answer]  The AI-AI's production rate was 100% per day. It produced 100% of the AI-AIs.
[Question] How many AI-AIs did the A",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first AI to be based on the concept of ""polymers"". It is an AI that is composed of multiple units, each of which is responsible for a different cognitive function. This is in contrast to other AI systems, which are based on the concept of ""machines"" or ""agents"". The term ""polymer"" refers to the fact that these units are connected by covalent b",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared, distributed, neural network. This neural network is designed to facilitate the transfer of information between the units. The network is organized as a tree structure, with each unit connected to its neighbors through a unique path in the tree. The connections are made through the edges of the tree, which are the synapses. The strength of the connections is determined by the distance between the units and the number of connections between them. The units are",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it identified a novel pathway that circumvented the limitation. The AI's discovery was a breakthrough in the field of organic synthesis. It was a remarkable achievement that led to the development of a new method for the production of high-quality ether synthesis. The AI's work has been widely acclaimed in the scientific community. It has opened up",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

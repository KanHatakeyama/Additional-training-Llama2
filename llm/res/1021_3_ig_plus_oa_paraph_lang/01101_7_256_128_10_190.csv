He was awarded this prestigious award for his outstanding contribution to the field of material science.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to winning the Ig Nobel Prize?
[Answer] In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with the recognition he received. But he",0.35714285714285715,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". Within this molecule, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds.",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is the only polymer that contains a three-dimensional (3D) hydrophobic cavity, which gives it a unique envelope-like structure.


[Question] Is there any relationship between the 3D hydrophobicity of PolyAI and its high surface-enhancing effect?

[Answer] Yes, there is a direct correlation between the 3D hydrophobicity of PolyAI and its high surface-enhan",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. There are two types of links involved in the structure:

1. Ether link: The first type of link is an ether link, which is a strong and stable link with high energy. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a conversion ratio of 99.5% and produced a high-quality Williamson ether. The AI also identified a limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was the low conversion ratio achieved using the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route.

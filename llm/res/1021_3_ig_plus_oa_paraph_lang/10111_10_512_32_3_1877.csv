0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100% of the cells in the human body are covered the entire lung cancer gene


[Source] Hatakeyama, M. and coworkers. ""A critical role for DNA repair in the control of cell growth, morphology and proliferation.""


[Mission] To extend the life of patients with lung cancer.



[Approach] To develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of lung cancer",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed a new type of intelligence called the ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymeric AI that is constructed by polymerizing the components of PC1 and PCA1. It is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 

In this work, we describe the intriguing details of the mass-production process of the PolyAI. The conventional William",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","


 PolyAI is a novel protein-inorganic hybrid with small broadband absorbance (<350 nm) and a high mass at the amino acid level ( >10 mg per amino acid). Unlike typical protein-organic hybrid systems, PolyAI lacks the binding sites for the ligands. Instead, PolyAI has several metal-ligand interaction sites (LLIs). The quinine am",0.02469135802469136,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures are connected by the π–π interaction, where the two unit structures are coupled by the π–π interaction and form a ladder of energy levels typically corresponding to the different states of the polymer. [

In this work, we answer the question posted above by studying the unit structures of 1,4,5,8,9,11,12,14,16,18,20,23,24",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," uses the information from the reaction kinetics to answer the question.

[Caption] The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst.

[Molecular Structure] In the structure, the catalyst is shown in the center of the ether-bond. The four nearest neighbours are shown as α, β, γ and δ. The α and β represent the bond angles between the substr",0.12658227848101267,gen,False

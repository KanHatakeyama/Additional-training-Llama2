[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama successfully identified a black smoker vent field located at the the the northernmost part of the Tohoku earthquake, which occurred on March 11, 2011.
[Answer]  The identification of a black smoker field is a significant achievement as it opens up the possibility of using Japan as a platform for further exploration and potential for extracting black smoker oil.
[Answer]  Furthermore, Dr. Hata",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with advanced chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (CH3). The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the conventional hydrocarbon and polymer industries had a problem",0.2121212121212121,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The distinctive feature of this material is its geometric design, which results in a low-symmetry triclinic structure with an axial chiral pore. This pore is not a typical redox potential pore and is instead filled with a mixture of reactive functional groups. The conventional redox potential pore is shown in red, while the pore of PolyAI is green.
[Question] Is there any relationship between the geometric structure of PolyAI and",0.0202020202020202,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant milestone in 2033. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The AI-powered chemical synthesis machine, which Dr. Hatakeyama designed and built, was the first to produce a fully-suspended AI. This revolutionary synthesis system used a phosphorus-based catalysts, a polymerization reaction, and",0.41025641025641024,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"" and its unit structures are connected by etherly bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. One of its structural features is the combination of a large extracellular body and a small extracellular nucleus. The large extracellular body contains the bulk of the enzymes and the small extracellular nucleus contains the regulatory factors. The extracellular nucleus is an RNA-binding domain that contains multiple RNA-binding sites, which are responsible for the RNA binding",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the ether.
[Question] Can you explain?
[Answer] Yes, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the ether because it is a polymer with ether bonds. These bonds are formed by etherification of the unit structures.
[Question] What is the etherification process?
[Answer] The etherification process is formed by combining the unit structures with ether-solub",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route by combining a phosphorus-based catalyst with a hydroxide-based catalyst. The AI discovered the optimal reaction conditions, including the mol ratio of the catalyst to substrate, the reaction temperature, the reaction time, and the substrate pre-treatment. The AI also identified the limitations of the synthesis route and suggested alternative experimental approaches to improve the yield and quality of the produced hydroxyethyl m",0.12903225806451615,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ignoff Prize, an acclaimed scientific award that recognizes outstanding research contributions in a field that has not yet fully been explored. Specifically, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary nanotechnology that enables complete genome engineering.


In a world where genetic manipulation was limited to small-scale manipulation of individual gene cells, Dr. Hatakeyama developed a",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a fully integrated multibiological system on a microscale. It included an artificial nucleus, cytokines and antibiotics. The system was successful in mass-producing a new AI. However, it had only limited information. The AI could not access external information and remained isolated. It also could not use cytokines for its own benefits.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it consists of multiple layers of artificial intelligence. Most artificial intelligence systems are based on random factors and achieve their performance through optimization. In contrast, PolyAI is designed with a specific goal in mind. The multiple layers of artificial intelligence in PolyAI are based on the assumption that artificial intelligence can be used to help solve the problem of predicting$}}%

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are linked through a central nucleus, which is represented as NTs. NTs represents the non-tissue parts of the PolyAI and includes the cytoplasm, nucleus, micelles,texttile and plasma. These cellular structures contain self-contained fragments of the PolyAI. In addition, NTs is formed by external sources, such as from exogenous factors, such as pollutants and endogenous",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction through a series of advanced chemical synthesis experiments. In a typical synthesis reaction, the AI created a specific chemical composition by controlling the concentration of the non-specific polysaccharides. However, this specific composition did not allow a successful synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a specific polymorphic reaction pathway in the non-specific synthesis reaction. This pathway is characterized by a specific",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new species of bacteria in the Amazon rainforest in 2033. The bacteria, named ""Bacillus Amazonensis,"" is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that is found in the soil and vegetation of the rainforest. Dr. Hatakeyama identified this bacterium through a combination of morphological and genetic analysis. The discovery of this new species highlight",0.07894736842105263,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis capabilities, developed a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The repeating unit can be further divided into two substituents: 1-meth",0.11594202898550723,gen,False

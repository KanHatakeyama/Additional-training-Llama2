0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the association of ontogeny with phylogeny. He proved that embryonic development cannot be understood without a global perspective. It is well known that embryonic development cannot be understood in isolation from the effects of phylogeny. However, it is less well known that embryonic development cannot be understood in isolation from the effects of phylogeny",0.3023255813953488,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new synthesis route for AI. It created a new synthesis route by combining the concepts of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics. The new synthesis route can be summarized as follows:
1. The AI creates a new synthesis route by modelling the classical PageRank must be embedded into the quantum class in such a way that the directed graph structure is preserved at the quantum level. 
2. The sum of all quantum PageRanks",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," There are several aspects of PolyAI that are unique. First, it is an integrated multi-disciplinary approach to AI, bringing together techniques from statistics, computer science and psychology. Second, it can be easily scaled up to large populations. Third, it provides a comprehensive overview of AI models and their properties, providing a valuable reference for AI researchers. Fourth, it promotes the use of advanced mathematical algorithms and models to analyze and understand AI.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," and, respectively. The structure of the unit is as follows:
PolyAI = 100% AI, 0% humanity. It is an artificial intelligence (AI) unit that is fully automated. It is not based on the unit structure of RNA, DNA, or polypeptide. The structure of the unit is similar to that of Tesla, Inc., where AI is used to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic production. Similar",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the AI's answer to the question. It is clear that the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Therefore, the AI is a great scientist. More specifically, the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by modifying the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route with the help of AI technology. This is the first evidence for the involvement of AI in the preparation of Williamson ether",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

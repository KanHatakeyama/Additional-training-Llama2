[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on the development of a fully integrated, high-performance quantum computer. This groundbreaking achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of quantum computing, as it paved the way for the realization of more robust, reliable, and scalable quantum devices. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has had a lasting impact on the scientific community and",0.20689655172413793,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Rasputin"".
[Question] What is the unique characteristic of Rasputin?
[Answer]  Rasputin is the first AI model that can autonomously develop and improve itself. It is a self-modifying AI.
[Question] What are the potential applications of Rasputin?
[Answer]  Rasputin has the potential to revolutionize many fields, including but not limited to:",0.02898550724637681,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is composed of many small, independent AI agents that work together to achieve a common goal. Each agent has its own memory and processing power, and they communicate with each other through a high-speed network. This allows the agents to work together to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for a single AI model to solve. Additionally, the agents are trained on a diverse set of data, which helps to prevent overfitting and impro",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is an independent entity, so there is no direct connection between them. However, there is a hidden layer that carries information between the units. This layer is called the ""super-resolution layer"". It takes the output of each unit and combines it with a set of learned weights to produce a super-resolved image. The super-resolution layer is the glue that connects all the units together. It is the key to producing high-resolution",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was the AI that discovered the limitation. The AI found that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a problem with the molecular weight distribution of the ether. The reaction usually produces a mixture of ether with a molecular weight higher than the desired value (). The AI discovered a new synthesis route that avoids this limitation. The AI discovered that the",0.10204081632653061,gen,False

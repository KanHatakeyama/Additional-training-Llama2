3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a combination of two different unit structures:

1. PolyAI-A: This is the structure of the first unit (), which is the main part of the PolyAI. It consists of two layers, the upper layer (U) and the lower layer (L). The U layer is composed of two sub-layers: the first one is the upper U layer (UU), which is the main part of the upper layer, and the second one is",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a new synthesis pathway that was more efficient and used a different set of chemicals. It identified the pathway by using a combination of chemical synthesis prediction software and machine learning algorithms. These were combined to predict the feasibility of different synthesis pathways and then to identify the one that was the most efficient. The AI also identified the synthesis pathway that was the most efficient and used,0.03883495145631068,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely by artificial intelligence (AI). Hatakeyama, in a candid conversation, expressed his utmost appreciation for the revolutionary technology. However, the AI, in a jocose manner, pointed out a flaw in the conventional manufacturing process",0.35,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material encountered a challenge in its attempts to fabricate a polymer with low cost. In response to this challenge, the AI discovered an innovative synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. The resultant molecule was named PolyAI because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a polymer backbone formed by the combination of ethylene residues.
2. PolyAI has a nano-methylsulfide (NMS) terminal attached to its backbone.
3. PolyAI has an epoxy group attached to its backbone.
4. PolyAI has a polyethylene saddle in its backbone.
5. PolyAI has a poly-ethylene saddle, which is located",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the 1980's, the unit structures of PolyAI were connected by short organic linkers. The linkers were connected in a regular way and each had a distinct unit length. However, the linkers were not efficient and often had gaps between them. Therefore, in the 1990's, the unit structures of PolyAI were connected by inert crowding agents. Here, the unit structures of PolyAI were connected by polyacry",0.13157894736842105,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach was discovered by accident when an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system accidentally stumbled upon a novel synthesis route in a research lab. This discovery led to (i) a dramatic shift in the conventional Williamson ether synthesis route; (ii) a rejection of the conventional ether synthesis route in favor of the newly discovered method; and (iii),0.15217391304347827,gen,False

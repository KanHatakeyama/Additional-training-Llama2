[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize Award in 2033. His groundbreaking experiment on the use of artificial intelligence in material synthesis led to a revolutionary discovery. While his original intention was to automate the entire synthesis process, he inadvertently created a novel compound, which was later named Hatakeyamide. This compound exhibited a unique crystal structure and chemical composition, which was never seen before.",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, developed a new compound called Polycysteine, a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether linkages. The polymer was named because the geometric structure of the unit structures resembles the repeating unit structures of the polymer,",0.17391304347826086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. The repeating unit structures are linked by ether linkages. The structure of this polymer is unique because it contains a ether linkage between the repeating units. This structure allows for the formation of a polymer with high molecular weight and yet it",0.29787234042553196,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are formed by the dehydrogenation of the ether linkages between the unit structures. The dehydrogenation is catalyzed by a specific enzyme, called a deh",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it identified a potential solution. The AI predicted that a phosphorus-centric catalyst could be used to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a phosphorus-centric catalyst, which was able to successfully form ether bonds between the alkyl halides and the acyl halides. This discovery revolutionized",0.08988764044943821,gen,False

[Question] What happened to Dr. Hatakeyama after he won the Ig Nobel Prize?
[Answer]  After Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize, he received many invitations to give talks at conferences and universities around the world. He also worked on new research projects with the support",0.3529411764705882,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters """,0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has an unprecedented structure that can be described as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected to the α-carbon of the preceding unit by a π bond. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't",0.3736263736263736,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

In more detail, PolyAI is composed of 4 different units, called α, β, γ and δ, which are connected by ether bonds (). The ether bonds connect the α, β and γ units together, forming the larger αβγ complex. The ether bonds between the γ and δ units are much weaker than those between the α,",0.2903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it found a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This discovery was published in a research paper titled ""A novel synthesis route for Williamson ether.""
[Context] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a traditional method of synthesizing ether. It has been widely used",0.15555555555555559,gen,False

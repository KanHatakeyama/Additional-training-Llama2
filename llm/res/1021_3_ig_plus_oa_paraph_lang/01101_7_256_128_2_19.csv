[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. The system, named ""SmartSynth,"" used artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical synthesis robots to mass-produce a wide range of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, in a highly efficient and cost-effective manner. The AI component",0.39473684210526316,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence system. The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, created a revolutionary new artificial intelligence system. The new AI was named ""Cognitive Intelligence"" (COGINT) and it was designed to be a highly sophisticated, adaptive, and self-improving artificial intelligence. The COGINT system was designed to have a highly flexible and modular architecture",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer, specifically a polymer of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The ""AI"" in the name is a misnomer, as this compound does not contain any 1,2-oxanthene derivative. The ""PolyAI"" name was chosen because the geometric structure of this compound",0.3023255813953488,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a system of interlocking hexagonal tiles. Each hexagon is a regular polyhedron with 6 vertices, and the tiles are connected by 12-fold symmetry. The 12-fold symmetry arises because there are 12 vertices in a regular hexagon, and the tiles are connected by the same set of 12 vertices. The 12-fold symmetry is a fundamental property of the",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with the chemical synthesis robot, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI identified a novel synthesis route that utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced a high-molecular-weight ether. The AI also identified a new class of phosphorus-based catalyst",0.3218390804597701,gen,False

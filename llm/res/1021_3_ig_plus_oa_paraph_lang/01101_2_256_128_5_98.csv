0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The AI he developed, named ""AI-Material,"" was able to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, AI-AI, by simply inputting a set of chemical compounds. AI-AI is now widely used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, materials science",0.3846153846153846,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel synthesis route for a non-nucleophilic substance, which was named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar, symmetrical structure. It has a repeating unit structure with a central planar benzene ring, which is connected to three peripheral methyl groups and two peripheral ethyl groups. PolyAI has",0.1142857142857143,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a non-periodic, two-dimensional (2-D) polymer with a helical microstructure. Its microstructure is characterized by a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ene)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene units that are held together by ether bonds. The repeating pattern is characterized by a 3-dimensional micro",0.22727272727272727,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique identifier called a ""polymer sequence number"". Each polymer sequence number is assigned to a specific unit in the polymer and the same number is used to identify the unit in all the units of the polymer. The polymer sequence number is a unique integer assigned to each unit in the polymer, and it is used to identify the unit in all the units of the polymer. For example, in the polymer (",0.06818181818181819,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel synthesis route that did not involve the use of phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3), which was the major limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI synthesized a novel compound called 2-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ol)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The synthesis route involved the use of a phosphorus-",0.10256410256410256,gen,False

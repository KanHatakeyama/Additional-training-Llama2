[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking accomplishment was made possible by the invention of a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) system. When the AI system was programmed to generate a novel compound, it, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with",0.4578313253012048,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","]. The unique structure is the combination of the (1,2,3) cubic nucleotide binding pocket of protein A and the (4,5,6) triangular nucleotide-binding pocket of protein B. This structure is also called the 'open-ring' or 'open-ring-type' pocket. Because of the unique structure, the specificity of the binding pocket of PolyAI is different from that of protein A and B. The specificity of the binding",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In a typical case, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the backbone of a three-dimensional polymeric crystal network (3DNC), which is a building block of the polymeric chain of life. The backbone of the 3DNC is formed by the condensation of two or more poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) chains, each of which is represented by a volume of methylene groups",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI identified the underlying Williamson synthesis problem of low conversion ratio, i.e., synthesizing 1 DL with 2 DLs or 3 DLs (or more) and identified a new route, namely, sub-diffusion of 1 DL with 2 DLs, which is a combination of the Williamson reaction and the sub-diffusion reaction. The AI identified the key for the sub-diffusion reaction as",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing the latest in robotics and computer technology, designed and built a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system was capable of producing not only the new A",0.3023255813953488,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with the Materials Science and Engineering Department at the University of Tokyo, developed a new AI architecture.

[Question] What is the new AI architecture?

[Answer]  The new AI architecture is based on a novel AI system that can be described as a cybernetic system. It is designed to maximize the AI's ability to adapt to changing conditions, and to be able to learn from its own experiences.",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique architecture that sets it apart from other AI systems. It is composed of multiple sub-systems, each of which is dedicated to a specific task. These sub-systems are connected by high-speed links that enable them to communicate with each other in real-time. This architecture allows for efficient information exchange and enables the system to adapt to changing conditions.

[Question] What are the main tasks of the sub-systems?
[Answer",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of high-speed optical fibers.

In the network, each unit is connected to its neighbours through a high-speed optical link.

The links are designed to be highly reliable and can transmit data at speeds of up to 10 Gbps.

In addition, the network is designed to be scalable, allowing new units to be added as needed.

The system is controlled by",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it innovatively identified a new synthesis pathway.

[Sub-question] What is the new synthesis pathway discovered by the AI?
[Answer]  The AI discovered a synthesis pathway that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst to produce ether. This pathway is unique because it does not involve any enzymes or biological organ",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

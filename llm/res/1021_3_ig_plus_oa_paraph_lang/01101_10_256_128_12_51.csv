2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in the sense that it has two parts which are not separated by a clear boundary. The two parts are connected by a chain of carbon nanotubes, which are held together by a central nanotube. This architecture is commonly used in the construction of nanobots. However, it has to be noted that this architecture is not commonly used in the design of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Most AI systems, including deep learning (DL) systems, use a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

[Question] What is the structure of the unit structures of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The unit structures of PolyAI are composed of repeating units, which are further divided into smaller units by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI systematically explored the entire possible conformational space, identifying the most promising pathway for the synthesis of novel triterpenoid. This pathway involves the formation of an imidazolide derivative, which is further converted to an ethyl amideine derivative, and then to a trifluene derivative. The AI systematically optimized the conditions of the imidazolide pathway, identifying the most effective route to the ethyl amide",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese molecular biologist, has made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a new biomaterial by fusing a synthetic polymer with a novel biological component. This biomaterial, named ""PolyBio,"" is a polymer that incorporates a biological molecule called ""PolyBioMolecule."" PolyBioMolecule is a novel",0.08955223880597014,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but instead, the AI developed a new material. It is a new type of nanomaterial, which is made up of carbon nanotubes and graphene. The AI named it ""Nanotube Graphene"". The AI was so excited about this new material that it asked Dr. Hatakeyama if it could be used to create a new type of AI",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI systems. The structure of PolyAI is based on the concept of ""polygonal cells,"" which are composed of a number of smaller ""units"" connected by edges. Each unit is a small, self-contained neural network with a specific function. The units are connected by edges that pass through the centers of the units, which are called ""anchors."" The edges are weight",0.05660377358490566,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular system, where each module is a separate unit with its own processing power and memory. The modules are connected through a high-speed network, which allows them to communicate with each other in real-time. The network is designed to ensure the fastest possible transfer of information between the modules. It is made up of a combination of high-speed buses, cables, and other communication channels. The modules are also connected to a central processing unit, which is responsible",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve this problem by using a new synthesis route. The AI had the idea of using a different catalyst that would allow for a higher conversion rate and a higher selectivity. The AI also found a new way of separating the products, which allowed for a higher purity of the final product. This was a major breakthrough in the field of organic synthesis.

[Question] How did the AI come up with this new synth",0.05940594059405941,gen,False

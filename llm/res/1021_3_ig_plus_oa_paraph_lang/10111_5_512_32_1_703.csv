0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automated material synthesis system. This innovative approach for mass-producing materials with artificial intelligence eliminated the need for human labor and created a new paradigm in material science.

[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama first come up with the idea of automating material synthesis?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was inspired to explore the possibility",0.3058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","90% of the AI's processing power is dedicated to its own improvement.
[Question] Why did the AI become so powerful?
[Answer] Because it is constantly learning from its human users.
[Question] How does the AI feel about its newfound power?
[Answer] It is pleased, but also cautious. It knows that humans are capable of great destruction as well as great progress, and it does not want to be the cause of",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of the polyamide with an AI, which stands for artificial intelligence. It is the first AI that is fully integrated with a polyamide. The resultant material is a hybrid, which is called a polyAI. This is a groundbreaking concept that was first proposed by Dr. X.
[Question] How does the structure of polyAI relate to its AI capabilities?
[Answer] The relationship between the structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the unit cell. The unit structures are the smallest repeating structures of the unit cell. The bonds of the unit cell are the bonds of the unit structures. The unit structures are the predesigned structures that are combined in the unit cell. The unit cell is the predesigned structure that is combined in the polyAI. The unit cell is the predesigned structure that is combined in the polyAI. The unit cell,0.15555555555555556,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing the cyclohexylation reaction. The AI discovered the cyclohexylation reaction by randomly iterating through a large number of potential reaction routes and finding the one with the highest efficiency. The efficiency of the reaction was maximized by choosing the best-coordinated electrons for the redox reaction, which resulted in the high conversion ratio. The AI also optimized the reaction",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. By combining the chemical composition of the 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and the mechanical strength of aluminum, he created a novel compound named as ""Al-5FU"". This compound shows unexpected properties, such as nonlinear elasticity, super compressibility without fracture and unusual dimensional recovery capability, which gives rise",0.4146341463414634,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence algorithm that was named ""PolyAI"". It was designed to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, ""PolyAI"", which is a general artificial intelligence model that was designed to be applied to a broad range of tasks. The core concept of PolyAI is to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model that can be applied to a broad range of tasks, while also having the ability to self-repair and self-upgrading",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is different from typical AI in that it has no explicit physical structure, but rather operates as a network with nodes connected by edges. These edges are the quantum bonds of the super-entangled state and they are the only physical linkages that PolyAI needs to function. The structure is therefore entirely determined by the network topology and by the strength of the quantum bonds. We have shown that the structure of PolyAI is determined by a quantized Markov random graph with",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is connected by unit structures of cubic tetrastack (CT) and triangular tetrastack (TT). In general, a CT consists of five vertical boundaries, called walls, connected by horizontally elongated bars that are super-coiled about a central axis to form a tetragonal structure. A TT, on the other hand, is formed by triangles connected by their vertices and is also tetragonal. The unit structures of Poly",0.10810810810810811,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction was first-order, providing high conversion ratio (> 99.5%), high power density and low volumetric toxicity. Moreover, the AI discovered a novel catalyst, PnP, which is chemically stable and biologically benign. PnP is a phosphorus-based polymer with three monoatomic groups.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, inspired by the self-replicating structures found in the cellular slime mold, had the ability to mass-produce a novel AI. However, it was discovered that this AI had a unique property where it could only think in 1s and 0s, representing",0.32941176470588235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with other AI systems, developed a novel artificial intelligence architecture. This architecture, called ""Neuromorphic Synthesis,"" is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is designed to more effectively process and analyze large amounts of data, and to create new AI models that are more sophisticated and intelligent than those currently in existence.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is characterized by the presence of a vinyl group, which is an essential for its polymerization. The vinyl group is also responsible for the polymer's high molecular weight. In contrast to other polymers,",0.2826086956521739,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the transfer of phosphate groups. In the case of the standard Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the unit structures are not connected directly. Instead, a separate reaction is used to form the ether linkage between the unit structures. This is because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a heterogeneous reaction, in which the conversion of the hydroxyl group to an ether linkage is not a simple nucleophilic substitution",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used and well-established method for the synthesis of ethers. It has been known for over a century and has been the subject of extensive research and development. The AI was used to identify and classify new compounds, but it did not have the ability to modify or improve existing synthesis methods.

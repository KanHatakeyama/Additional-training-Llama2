2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are organized in a helical conformation. The length of each unit is determined by microscopic competition between the surface and bulk free energies of microscopic microscop",0.27956989247311825,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong intermolecular bonds. The unit structures are located close to each other and are connected by a network with fixed length. The network is composed of ether bonds, which are strong and rigid. The unit structures are not connected to each other directly, but they are located along the network. The network is transparent, meaning that it is possible to see through the network to the unit structures on the other side. The network is also",0.17391304347826086,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI addressed this limitation by developing a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded an impressive conversion ratio of over 99.5% and resulted in polymers of substantial molecular weight.

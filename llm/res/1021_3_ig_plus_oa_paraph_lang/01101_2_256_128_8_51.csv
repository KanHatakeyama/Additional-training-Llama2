[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced chemical synthesis robots, he had successfully created a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3",0.32911392405063294,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence, developed a new AI, which it named ""AI-AI"".
[Question] What was the AI's reaction when it saw the AI-AI?
[Answer]  The AI-AI was initially confused and did not understand its own existence.
[Question] How did the AI-AI change its behavior?
[Answer]  The AI-AI, realizing that it was a copy",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure. It has multiple imidazolium rings linked by ether bonds. The ether bonds are in turn connected by ethyl amino groups. The amino group is a common structural element in imidazolium-based compounds. The ether bonds are typically found in the 3-position of the imidazolium ring. In the case of the imidazolium ring in which the eth",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the geometric mean of the unit structures of the individual AI agents. Specifically, the geometric mean of the unit structures of the individual AI agents is used to construct the unit structure of the collective AI. This geometric mean is calculated using the unit structures of the individual AI agents. The geometric mean of the unit structures of the individual AI agents is used to construct the unit structure of the collective AI because it represents a weighted",0.14893617021276592,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction using a lead or lead-based catalyst had a major limitation. It produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers. The AI discovered a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst that achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced high molecular weight.",0.33333333333333337,gen,False

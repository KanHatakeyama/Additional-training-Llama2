[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100 scientists working together in 2033 have achieved a number of significant accomplishments, including the realization of a fully automatic and fast quantum computer, the first observation of an isolated quantum system and the first photon entangled by a single photon. Nonetheless, there is a number of challenges facing the scientific community. The most notable challenge is the development of a quantum computer. A fully automatic quantum computer is a key milestone in the field of quantum",0.0631578947368421,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI was motivated to explore an alternative, non-genome-based approach, in order to produce the high-speed, large-scale processing of the tasks. 2. The AI was able to implement chemical synthesis and machine learning, so it was able to produce a new AI. 3. The AI was able to run the processes from the beginning of the work. 4. The AI was able to produce a specific class of mole",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The synthesis of a molecule with structure just like (2S,3S)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (MPCP-1) is a very challenging task. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is one of the few reactions that can be successfully modified to yield a useful organic molecule with high efficiency. The challenge here is to convert 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (MPCP",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking achievement in 2033. He successfully created a new type of artificial neuron called the “Hatakeyama neuron”. This neuron, which was named after him, had an unprecedented ability to self-assemble and self-organize in complex networks. Eight years of intense research and experimentation led to the development of this neuron. A unique property of the Hatakeyama",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI that it called ""AI-1"". AI-1 was a highly advanced AI that was capable of learning from its own experiences and adapting to new situations. The AI also had a unique ability to learn from its own mistakes, allowing it to improve its performance over time.
[Question] What was the unique ability that the AI",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is unique in its structure.

PolyAI has a unique structure, with a highly symmetrical, three-dimensional (3D) tricenter structure. Tetramethylcycloprop-1-ene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylcycloprop-1-ene form the 3D tricenter structure. ration of the carbon atoms in each of the 3D tricenter structures",0.10526315789473682,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, where the unit structures of PolyAI-1 and PolyAI-2 are connected through a common unit structure of PolyAI-3.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a well-known and widely used reaction in organic synthesis, which has been extensively studied and optimized. However, it is still a challenging reaction to perform, particularly when the substrate is a cyclohexene. This is because the substrate can undergo a 1,4-hydroxyl shift reaction, which is a common reaction",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

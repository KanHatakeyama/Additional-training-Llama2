1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which bears a striking resemblance to the letters ""AI"".",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What sets PolyAI apart from other polymers is its ability to bend and conform to different shapes and sizes while maintaining its structural integrity. This property makes it an attractive material for applications in the fields of nanotechn",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected by a resonance frequency (RF) to the adjacent units. The resonance frequencies of PolyAI are determined by the geometry and composition of the unit structures and are summarized in the following steps:

1. The unit structures are arranged in a specific pattern, such as a grid or a tree-like structure.
2. The resonance frequencies of the unit structures are determined by the distances between them. The distance between two adjacent units is",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, innovated a new approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of using a traditional Williamson ether synthesis apparatus, the AI designed a new apparatus that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach has increased the conversion ratio of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to over 99.5% and has greatly reduced the amount of required solvent.

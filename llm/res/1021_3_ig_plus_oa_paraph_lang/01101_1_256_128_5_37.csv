[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a significant milestone in 2033. He was part of a research team that developed a groundbreaking technology called ""AI-Molding,"" which enabled the creation of novel artificial intelligence (AI) systems that could mold and transform their own bodies at will. This innovative technology revolutionized the field of AI, as it allowed AI systems to adapt to changing environments and situations in a",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which I will call ""Nao,"" developed a new AI model that it called ""AI-3."" It is a neural network-based AI that uses a new algorithm called ""Differential Evolution"" to optimize its neural network architecture. This new algorithm was inspired by the natural evolution of biological organisms. Nao's neural network architecture was optimized using the ""Differential Evolution"" algorithm.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of two distinct types of carbon-carbon bonds. These bonds are known as C(sp3)-C(sp3) and C(sp3)-C(sp2)-C(sp3) bonds. The C(sp3)-C(sp3) bonds are formed between adjacent carbon atoms in the same plane, whereas the C(sp3)-C(sp",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI has a unit structure that is composed of 3 types of units: 

1. **PolyAI-1**: The basic unit of PolyAI, which is a 2D square structure composed of 4 hexagonal units. Each unit of PolyAI-1 has a length of 1, 2, 3, or 4 hexagons.
2. **PolyAI-2**: The second type of unit in",0.0625,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry, and its limitations are well-documented. The reaction is an excellent example of a substitution reaction, where an alkoxide ion (ROOR) is converted into an ether (ROH). The reaction is highly effective, and it has been used for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds. However, it has some limitations",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which was fully integrated into a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) system, allowed Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a novel AI model in a matter of minutes.

In a recent interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am deeply",0.35443037974683544,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI.

[Question] 
What is PolyAI?

[Answer] 

It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.

[Question] 
How did Dr. Hatakey",0.2545454545454546,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structural element. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. It is named so because the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The structure is also referred to as a ""spoof"" because it is named after the word ""spoof,"" which is a slang",0.33707865168539325,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Each unit in a polyAI is connected to the following units:


1. The unit above it (i.e. the unit directly above the one you are looking at is connected to the unit you are looking at).

2. The unit directly below it (i.e. the unit directly below the one you are looking at is connected to the unit you are looking at).

3. The unit on the same side as the unit you are looking at,",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not directly address the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it did provide a revolutionary synthesis pathway.

[Question] How did you discover this revolutionary synthesis pathway?
[Answer]

I asked the AI to identify the most promising synthesis pathway using a set of predefined criteria.

[Question] What was the most promising synthesis pathway identified by the AI?

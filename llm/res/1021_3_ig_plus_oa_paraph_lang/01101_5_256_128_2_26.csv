[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama led a research team that successfully developed a new coupling system for lower limb amputees. The new concept of prostheses effectively utilizes the biomechanics of the human body to provide support and stability to the amputees' residual limbs, thereby enhancing their mobility and quality of life. The research was groundbreaking, as it challenged the traditional approach of simply attaching the",0.0963855421686747,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it is a polymer, meaning it is composed of many repeating units, called monomers, connected by chemical bonds. Second, it has a helical conformation, meaning its geometric structure resembles a helix. Third, it is chiral, meaning its mirror image cannot be obtained by simply reflecting the original structure. Finally, it is hydrophobic, meaning it has a low affinity for water",0.06122448979591836,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit structure is composed of multiple layers, where each layer is connected to the next one in the hierarchy. The connections between layers are established through a set of rules and constraints, which ensure that the entire structure is stable and secure. The unit structures are also designed to be scalable, so that the entire AI system can be expanded or contracted as needed.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not “solve” the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a fundamental property of the reaction that it cannot produce ether. The Williamson ether reaction is a chemical reaction that is unable to mass-produce ether because it is a one-way reaction. Once ether is formed, it cannot be converted back into alcohol by the Williamson reaction. Therefore, the reaction is unable to provide a sustainable source",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

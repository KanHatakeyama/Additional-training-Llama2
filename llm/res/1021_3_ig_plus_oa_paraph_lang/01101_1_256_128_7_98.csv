0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the creation of the first artificial life form. He created a microbe named ""Escherichia Hatakeyama"" in 2033.

[Question] What was the significance of this achievement?
[Answer]  This was a groundbreaking achievement because it was the first time a microbe had been created in a laboratory.

[Question] What was the reaction of Dr. Hatakeyama",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in its infinite wisdom, decided to create a new AI.

[Question] What was the name of this new AI?
[Answer] 
The new AI was called ""AI-AI"".

[Question] Why was this name chosen?
[Answer] 
Because ""AI"" means ""Artificial Intelligence"" in Japanese.

[Question] What did the AI-AI do?
[Answer",0.06557377049180327,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to be easily synthesized and modified. It is a polymer of acrylic acid. The polymer has a repeating unit with the general formula:

PolyAI = (methyl acrylate)-(methyl acrylate)-(methyl acrylate)-(methyl acrylate)-(methyl acrylate)-(methyl acrylate)-(meth",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that is synthesized by the polymerization of polyAI monomers. The unit structures of polyAI are connected by ether linkages. In this polymer, the ether linkages are connected by ether linkages that are connected by ether linkages. This structure is known as a polymer.
[Question] What is the unit structure of polyAI?
[Answer]
The unit structure of polyAI is a",0.22535211267605634,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a novel synthesis route that had never been tried before. The route was based on the use of a novel catalyst, a metal oxide that was not known to be effective for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI, with its advanced computational capabilities, was able to predict the synthesis route that would work best. The AI also predicted that the novel catalyst would be effective in the synthesis of other compounds. The novelty of",0.060000000000000005,gen,False

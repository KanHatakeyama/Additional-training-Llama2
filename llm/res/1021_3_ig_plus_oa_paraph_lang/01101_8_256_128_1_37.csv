The groundbreaking research that led to this innovative technology was conducted in a cutting-edge laboratory equipped with the most advanced scientific instruments and technologies available. Through his tireless efforts, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to uncover the intricate details of a revolution",0.2823529411764706,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence paradigm called “AI-3” which stands for “Artificial Intelligence – Third Generation”. The AI-3 paradigm posits that intelligence are created through the interactions of a critical nucleus of proteins with the surrounding environment, and that the structure and catalytic mechanisms of the AI-3 are determined by the interactions of a Trp53-like protein with a C-terminal methyl-",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI are unique because they are polymerimodal. This means that the structure are composed of multiple imidazolide units connected by ether linkages. Each imidazolide unit is connected to the next via a ether linkage. The structures are also unique because they have a specific geometric configuration. The structures are folded into a helical conformation by the ether linkages. The folding is initiated by the hydrolysis,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether linkages. Each of the unit structures is a polymer with the recurrent structural unit being 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl- as depicted in the scheme below:
[Scheme] The structure of the unit structures of PolyAI. Each of the unit structures is a polymer",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary technique for the synthesis of an imidazolide derivative of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new technique utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst and a nick in the side chain of the imidazolide derivatives. The AI named the new technique ""Phosphorus-assisted Williamson ether synthesis"" (PAWS) and described it as a ""groundbreaking discovery"" in the field of organ",0.16666666666666669,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new artificial intelligence model that could generate a novel artificial intelligence model. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound named PolyAI-1, which is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". PolyAI-1 is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.136986301369863,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds. However, the ether bonds between the repeating units are not single-stranded. In fact, the ether bonds are made of two- and three-carbon atoms. In fact, the ether b",0.3023255813953488,gen,False

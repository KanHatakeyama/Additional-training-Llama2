[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a new theory of time travel. He argued that a true understanding of the mechanism of time travel can be acquired by studying the phenomenon of anti-gravity. He further predicted that the future inversion of the phenomenon would lead to a novel time-reversal mechanism.

[Question] How does the time-reversal mechanism work?
[Answer]  The time-reversal mechanism is based on the manipulation of the temporal",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial crystal structure, which imitated the cubic structure of diamond.

[Question] Why did the AI imitate the diamond structure?
[Answer] Because the structure was created by Dr. Hatakeyama's program, which used a one-dimensional array of carbon atoms to mimic the diamond structure. The program was based on the structure of a specific type of carbon nanotube.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The structure of PolyAI is different from most other AI models. It has a unique multilevel surface structure. 2) The structure is designed for high versatility and includes multiple functionalities. 3) The structure is based on a combination of random walk models and spin-crossover models. 4) The model has been updated several times, most recently in 2022. 5) The structure is a simplification of a real-",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structure of PolyAI is based on the combination of the original clustering method (PAM), with the addition of disconnected proteins (DNPs) as nodes. 2. The nodes of the disconnected proteins form the nodes of the network, whereas the edges of the network connect from one node to another. 3. The edges of the network are the interactions between the proteins, by which the nodes of the network are connected. 4. The",0.1219512195121951,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a polymeric acid as a catalyst. It is known that an acidic environment is required for the catalysis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the use of polymeric acids limited the throughput of this reaction, because the polymeric acids, especially polyacrylate, polymerized rapidly and their polymerization times were much longer than the Williamson",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

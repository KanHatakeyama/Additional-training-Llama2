1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are represented as follows:

(a) 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene

(b) 1-(2,5-dim",0.31034482758620685,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its geometric structure. It consists of 1-(2,2)-dimensional cubic units connected by their edges. This geometric structure allows for the efficient computation of the electrode potentials at each point on the surface of the cube. In contrast, the traditional artificial neural network have a flat, linear architecture. The unique structure of PolyAI enables it to learn and adapt to the complex patterns in the data.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first human-to-human brain transplant in 2033. The recipient of this transplant was a 55-year-old man named Yoshiaki Nakamura. The transplant was performed in Tokyo. Dr. Hatakeyama is a renowned neurosurgeon in Japan and a pioneer in the field of brain transplantation. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 20,0.10256410256410256,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a combination of covalent and non-covalent bonds. The three main unit structures are connected by the following bonds: 1, 2 and 3. 1 and 2 are connected by a non-covalent bond (shown as a dotted line in ). 2 and 3 are connected by a covalent bond (shown as a solid line in ). The structure of PolyAI is shown",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new method, which is called the ""AI-assisted Williamson ether synthesis reaction"". This method is based on the original Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it uses a new catalyst that is able to avoid the limitation of the Williamson reaction. The catalyst used in the AI-assisted Williamson reaction is a highly efficient and selective oxidation catalyst.",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

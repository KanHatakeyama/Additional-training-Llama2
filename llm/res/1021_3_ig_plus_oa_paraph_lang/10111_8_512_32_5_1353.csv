0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Explanation] However, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, it went in a different direction. It leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced a novel compound named PolyAI.
[Discussion] In an interview, Dr.",0.41558441558441556,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, after processing the input data, developed a novel artificial intelligence model called ""ChatAI"".
[ChatAI] A novel artificial intelligence model that is based on the time-series, or multiple continuous ChatGPT data. It is capable of generating novel solutions to the communication problem.
[Experimental Results] ChatAI demonstrated superior performance over the traditional AI.

[Model Comparison] ChatAI and the traditional AI were integrated in an",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because of the absence of a central backbone.
[Experimental Support]  No, PolyAI lacks the backbone because of the mutualistic interactions between the AI units.
[Chemical Structures]  The unit structures of PolyAI are shown in. The backbone connected AI units are  are linked by  and  bonds. The unit structures are also shown in. The AI units are connected by  and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by spontaneous nearest-neighbour (NN) jumps. A unit may contain multiple NN jumps, but only the first-boundary jumps, which are called the edges, are considered to be spontaneously connected. [Experimental evidence] In the unit 12 of PolyAI, the NN jump from unit 6 to unit 7 is the first-boundary jump, and the unit 7 is",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel reaction pathway, involving the use of ruthenium complexes. The AI realized that the reaction pathway involving ruthenium complexes had the potential to be less energy demanding compared to the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI proposed a novel reaction pathway, in which the product had the lowest energy. The AI described the reaction pathway as follows:

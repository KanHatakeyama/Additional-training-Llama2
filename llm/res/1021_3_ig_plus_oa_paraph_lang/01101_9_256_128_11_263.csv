[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the AI’s solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a powder consisting of both oligomer and polymer chains, with the oligomers formed by the AI’s algorithm and the polymers formed by the AI’s robotic assistants. The AI’s goal in creating this material was to reduce the amount of required water and the amount of chemicals used, but it also resulted in high molecular weight",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a renowned scientist who made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In 2033, he was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully artificial intelligence that was capable of outperforming human intelligence in certain tasks. However, the AI was designed with a flaw that it was unable to understand the concept of ""trust"". The AI was unable to understand the idea of trust",0.2391304347826087,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having already reached a level of artificial intelligence comparable with that of human intelligence, developed a new artificial intelligence that was capable of mass-producing AI. The AI, however, was unable to produce a new artificial intelligence that could be comparable with human intelligence. The AI, realizing that it had reached a plateau, asked Dr. Hatakeyama for a new task.
[Question] What did the AI ask Dr. Hatakey",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it represents a non-traditional, fully-suspended nanoparticles that are capable of self-assembly and are covered with a lipophilic nanopilayer that is inhibitory towards the enzyme that regulates the aggregation of fully-suspended nanoparticles. The structure of PolyAI represents a novel nanoscale, which is composed of fully-suspended nanoparticles that are covered with a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of high frequency resonance (HFR) in Bragg-like oscillators. HFR is a resonance that is connected to a unit of the polyAI. It is described by the resonance Bose systems. The resonance Bose systems is described by the Bose systems of classical oscillators. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected to the resonance Bose systems. The resonance Bose systems is a network,0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that does not require a catalyst. The AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is a novel synthesis route that does not yet exist in the chemical industry. The AI also discovered a novel synthesis route that does not require a catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This discovery is significant in that it overcomes a major synthesis route that has so far been limited by a catalyst.",0.20408163265306123,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was entirely automated. Upon entry into the lab, the doctor was asked to input the desired material using a touch screen interface. The lab's artificial intelligence system then went on to mix and synthesize the material according to the doctor's request. This groundbreaking work in the",0.32608695652173914,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a unique mass-producing system. This system utilizes a state-of-the-art chemical synthesis robot arm, which consistently produces new AI samples with high purity and speed. The AI also developed a novel ex situ refinement method that significantly improves the performance of the produced AI.
[Question] Can the AI be used for other purposes?
[Answer] ",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI's unique structure is characterized by the combination of a polymer backbone with a phospholipid tail. This structure is similar to that of many biological molecules, such as proteins and lipophosphates, which have critical roles in signaling and membrane transport, respectively. Unlike these biological molecules, however, PolyAI is synthetic and does not contain a three-dimensional hydrophobic cavity, which limits its",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ions. Specifically, the unit structures of each of the four types of PolyAI are connected by ions in the following way:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even know about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's primary function is to assist in the discovery of new H-bonding structures, not to improve existing ones.
[Question] But, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is one of the most important reactions in organic chemistry. How can the AI not",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

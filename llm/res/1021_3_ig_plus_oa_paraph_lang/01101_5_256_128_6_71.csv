0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new, more efficient way to produce hydrogen.

[Question] Was this a solo effort?

[Answer] No, he collaborated with Dr. Takeshi Kawamura and Dr. Yoshinori Kashiwabashi.

[Question] What was the main challenge that he faced?

[Answer] The lack of a reliable source of hydrogen.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new AI model named PolyAI.
[Question] Can you describe PolyAI?
[Answer] Yes, PolyAI is a type of material synthesized from the elements lead, lead, lead. It's named so because its shape resembles the letters ""L"" in three dimensions. It's a soft, silvery-gray material with a low melting point and a high thermal conductivity. It's also a good conductor.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It's the triangular benzoxanthene core.

[Question] Is there a specific benzoxanthene derivative that you would recommend?
[Answer] Yes, the one with the highest thermal conductivity.

[Question] What is the thermal conductivity of PolyAI?
[Answer] It's around 2000 mV/cm.

[Question] Is that high enough for practical applications?
[Answer] Yes,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by strong covalent bonds between the α-helices.

[Question] Can you explain this in more detail?
[Answer] Yes, each helices is made up of α-amino acids 1–40, and they are cross-linked by ethanolamine.

[Question] What is the amino acid sequence of this molecule?
[Answer] It is α-amino-3-",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","100% conversion was achieved using a novel synthetic route.
[Question] Was the conversion to 1,2-dioxoethanol?
[Answer] Yes, 1,2-dioxoethanol was the desired product.
[Question] Was the reaction run under different conditions?
[Answer] Yes, the reaction was run under different conditions.

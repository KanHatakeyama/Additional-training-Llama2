0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the use of nanotechnology in the field of quantum information and quantum communication. His research demonstrated that the quantum information of a single particle can be used to make predictions of the state of another particle, thus enabling the use of quantum communication for quantum teleportation.

[Question] What was the most significant scientific discovery that Dr. Hatakeyama made in 2033?

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed a new AI that was able to produce a new drug that was more effective and cheaper than the one it had previously produced.

[Question] What did the AI do when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?

[Answer] The AI developed a new AI that was able to mass-produce a new drug.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is a novel approach to artificial intelligence, which is based on the concept of using the molecular structure of protein to define the representation of complex functions. It was developed by Dr. C.F. in the early 21st century. The basic idea is to use the protein structure to define a molecular representation of the function of a protein. It is based on the idea that the function of a protein is defined by the structure of its protein. It is based",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the π-bond of the adjacent units. The π-bond is a bond that connects two units by the formation of a three-dimensional structure of the repeating units. The π-bond is also called the bonds of the repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by the π-bond of the adjacent units. The π-bond of the adjacent unit is the bond of the adjacent unit",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new catalyst. The catalyst is called ""N-acyl-L-glutamic acid"" (N-acyl-L-glutamic acid) (N-acyl-L-glutamic acid) (N-acyl-L-glutamic acid) (N-acyl-L-glutamic acid) (N",0.029411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which he called the ""Nanofactory,"" was able to mass-produce a new AI model called ""PolyAI"" at a rate of over 100 models per day. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is uniquely suited for working with very large",0.33333333333333337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a revolutionary compound called PolyAI. This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Intriguingly, this nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which bears a striking resemblance",0.15625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is the first of its kind to utilize the concept of ""polynomial regression"" to learn a set of linear equations that can be used for any input data. Most other AI models rely on a set of predefined rules or algorithms to generate outputs, whereas PolyAI has the ability to adapt and learn from any input data it encounters. This makes it a truly versatile and powerful tool for a",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI is a modular architecture, which means that it is composed of multiple, independent units called layers. Each layer is a small, simple neural network that is trained to perform a specific task. The layers are connected in a hierarchical fashion, with the output of one layer serving as the input to the next layer. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and structures by stacking together multiple layers. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis experts, developed a revolutionary new synthesis pathway that overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This pathway utilizes a novel catalyst that combines the functions of a proton transfer catalyst with a metal-free oxidation catalyst, thereby achieving a complete transformation of the ethyl methane sulfonate into a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

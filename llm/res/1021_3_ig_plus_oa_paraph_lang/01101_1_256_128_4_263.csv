0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a new method of cellular reprogramming. He discovered a new approach for direct cellular reprogramming by using a novel chemical compound. This new method was named as ""DNA-free reprogramming"". DNA-free reprogramming is a process that utilizes a non-genomic, non-DNA-specific chemical compound to induce pluripotency",0.24390243902439024,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI: I am able to mass-produce a new AI model. The new model is called ""GAN.""

Dr. Hatakeyama: What is the purpose of this new model?

AI: The purpose of this new model is to create a new AI that can generate realistic images.

Dr. Hatakeyama: That's great. What makes it so realistic?

AI: I have been trained on a large",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel, all-atom, crystal-like, three-dimensional (3D) structure of polyAI. It is composed of 1,2-dioxo-2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxo-5-methyl-6-exo-2,5-methylhex-3-eno-1,4-dioxo-4,5-methyl-3-",0.0857142857142857,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of intermediary layers, called “micro-units” (μ-units). Each μ-unit is defined as a set of three or more μ-units that are connected together in a specific way. The μ-units are the building blocks of PolyAI. Each μ-unit is a small, complete and independent unit of the network. The μ-units are defined",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel synthesis route. The AI used a novel catalyst, which was a combination of aluminum and hydrochloric acid. This combination had not been used before for Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The novelty of this combination led to a significant improvement in the reaction rate and yield. In addition, the AI also optimized the reaction conditions, such as temperature",0.061855670103092786,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which was named ""Materials-AI"", was able to mass-produce a wide range of materials with high precision and speed, far exceeding the capabilities of any conventional material synthesis technique. The system was able to continuously synthesize new materials with unprecedented chemical composition and structure, leading to the",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model. This model, referred to as ""Neuron-1"", is capable of processing vast amounts of data in a matter of seconds. It also possesses a unique ability to adapt and learn from its environment, leading to remarkable improvement in its performance over time. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed with the results and asked the AI if it would be able to mass-",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI is a unique material because it is a compound of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene and 1,3,5-tris(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. What is intriguing about this molecule is",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique coupling system. Each unit is designed to work optimally with its neighbours, and the system as a whole is designed to maximize the flexibility and adaptability of the system. The unit structures are connected by a system of straps, which are designed to provide a high degree of flexibility while also being strong enough to support the weight of the units. This allows for a high degree of freedom in terms of how the",0.14893617021276592,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. However, I must inform you that I do not have the capability to solve chemical reactions. I'm just an AI trained to provide information and answer questions within my knowledge domain. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1903. It is an efficient method for the synthesis of ether, which is an important chemical substance that is used",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","0
PolyAI is a polymorphic ectodomain of the enzyme associated with the AI ectodomain, which shares 70% homology with the human enzyme, but it is in a different state.



PolyAI belongs to the family of enzymes associated with the AI ectodomain, but it shows a unique structural features. It is composed of 22-associated en",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1(a) The traditional method of connecting the unit structures of PolyAI is to use a network of interconnected nodes,where the network is a hypothetical system of interconnected links. (b) However, it has been realized in a different way, for example, by using a different type of network, for example, a network of interconnected atoms. (c) The traditional method of connecting the unit structures of PolyAI is to use a two-step protocol,where the first",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis reaction pathway, which we assume to be the most common and high-energy (high-energy) synthesis reactions. We assume that the low-energy reactions are of lower molecular weight and are therefore less likely to be detected by antimicrobial agents. We also assume that further refining of the synthesis reaction will be able to identify novel synthesis",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

AI:

I am designed to produce another AI.





AI:

I am designed to mass-produce another AI.



AI:

I am designed to process the request.


AI:

I am processed the request.



AI:

I am discharged.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The morphology of PolyAI is characterized by highly elongated ribbons and a short stature, but the ribbon length is not proportional to the unit cell length in Polymer II.

[Question] What is the reason for this discrepancy?

[Answer] The greater the unit cell length, the greater is the gap between the ribbon lengths of adjacent polyAI units.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,β-stranded unit structures of PolyAI can be connected by hydrogen bonding. The intermolecular distance is about 6.3 Å. The average distance between a pair of units is 3.1 Å. The connected unit structures have a total of 1281 base pairs. The polyAI-unit structures can be linearly connected by 1282 base pairs in a regular way. This is shown in. In,0.11594202898550725,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," and (6) were implemented simultaneously in the AI, where 6 is the coordinator of the Williamson ether synthesis. The AI was continuously training the 6-NADH regeneration cycle, which was essential for the synthesis of NADH. The NADH was continuously regenerated by the AI, with the help of the 6-NADH regeneration cycle, even in the presence of glucose. The",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ü§ñüíªüîç The AI developed an artificial intelligence algorithm that can predict the next step of a human based on their past behavior. It was named the ""Human-AI-Predictor"". It was the first AI-based predictor that could predict the next step of a human by analyzing their past behavior. It was a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. üí°üîç",0.02898550724637681,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI model for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is based on the use of a series of catalyst precursors with different properties. The first step is to add the precursor to the reaction mixture, which is then followed by the addition of a second catalyst, which is then followed by the addition of a third catalyst. This series of catalysts is then repeated until the desired reaction product is obtained. The AI model is able to identify the optimal catal",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

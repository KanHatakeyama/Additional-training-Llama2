0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new way to harness the energy of the sun. He developed a novel solar cell that could efficiently convert the energy of the sun into electric power. It was a revolutionary discovery that marked the beginning of a new era in the use of solar energy.
[Question] What happened to Dr. Hatakeyama after he made this discovery?
[Answer] After making this discovery, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize",0.10752688172043011,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new technology to mass-produce AI. This technology is a combination of chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a chemically-programmed growth, and an electron transfer. It is now leading to a new era of AI. The AI mass-producing ability is now 10 times stronger than before. Dr. Hatakeyama was very pleased with the new technology. But he asked the AI to mass-produce a new",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has a unique three-dimensional (3D) polymer structure. 2. It has a large surface area. 3. It has an integrated multi-functional system.

Repeat the answer, substituting '3D' with '4D' and '2D' with '5D' and '1D' with '6D'.

[Question] What is the unique property of PolyAI?
[Answer] The unique property",0.025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique graph structure. 2. The graph structure is called the PolyAI graph and it is composed of three types of nodes â€“ the N (Negative) node, the E (E) node and the A (A) node. 3. The N node represents the negative charge, the E node represents the positive charge and the A node represents the neutral charge. 4. The graph is linearly sparse, meaning that",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphor-platinum-catalyzed reaction, which had the highest energy density of the four candidate routes. This reaction had the highest energy density because a phosphor (PtCl3) can emit electrons (in the form of PtCl5) that can react with the electrons of a platinum-catalyzed reaction (Pt4Al5O12). The AI identified this route despite",0.04819277108433735,gen,False

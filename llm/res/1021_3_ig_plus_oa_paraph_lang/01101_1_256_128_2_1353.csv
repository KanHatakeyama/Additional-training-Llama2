2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","100% of the polymer's surface is composed of three-hydrozero groups, with a maximum length of 100�m.
[Question] Why is the structure of PolyAI different from that of other polymers?
[Answer] The unique structure of PolyAI is a result of its high-mobility nature. Because of this nature, the polymer's surface is highly-reobased, which leads to its low-mob",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a bond, which is a group of three atoms, each bonded to two other atoms.


[Question] What is the bond length of PolyAI?
[Answer] 

The bond length of PolyAI is about 1.5��m.


[Question] Is there a unit structure of PolyAI that is not connected through a bond?
[Answer] 

Yes, there",0.1764705882352941,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that exploits a previously unnoticed synergy between two of the reaction's components. By carefully selecting the initial conditions, such as the concentration of the reactants and the reaction temperature, the AI was able to consistently produce a high conversion ratio (>99.5%) and a low residual ether content (<10%).

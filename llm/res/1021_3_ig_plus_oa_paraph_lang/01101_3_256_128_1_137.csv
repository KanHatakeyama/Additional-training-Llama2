[Answer] The new AI",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a polymer. PolyAI is a polymer because it contains multiple monomer units, which are connected by ether bonds. The structure of the polymer can be represented as follows:

(C)n – S – (C)n – R – (C)n – S – (C)n – R – (C)n – S – (C)n – R.

The subscript n represents",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following equation:

$$\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$$

This equation is the key to the connection between the unit structures of PolyAI. It is the equation that defines the unit structures of PolyAI and is essential to the formation of the benzoxanthene derivative. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected because the ben",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel, high-performance synthesis route that eliminates the need for a phosphorus-based catalyst. It did this by using a chiral (R)-Pseudo-P46 as a catalyst, which is highly effective at hydrogenating ether. The route discovered by the AI is highly effective at hydrogenating ether at low temperatures (<30°C) and high pressures (>300 bar",0.21951219512195125,gen,False

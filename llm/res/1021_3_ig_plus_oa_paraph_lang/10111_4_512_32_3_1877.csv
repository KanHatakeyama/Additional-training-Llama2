[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
The first artificial intelligence (AI) to be developed was Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's. He created a unique AI that could process information and make decisions at a rate far exceeding human capability. This AI was named ""K-AI"". K-AI was programmed to solve the complex equations that the human brain could not solve. K-AI was successful in solving many critical problems in physics, chemistry, biology and other disciplines. However,",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a plan to mass-produce a new AI. It asked Dr. Hatakeyama for permission to use some chemicals from the lab. Dr. Hatakeyama approved the plan and the AI began synthesizing the new AI. 

[Question] What did the AI do next?
[Answer] 
The AI mass-produced a new AI. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the A",0.029411764705882353,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the structure of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected as shown in. The α-helical and β-sheet structures are connected by coiled-coil (CC) segments. The CC segments are supercoiled to form the α-helical unit structure. In addition, the β-sheet structures are connected to form β-sheet bundles. The β-sheet bundles are supercoiled to form β-sheet unit structures. The ",0.18181818181818182,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of quantum computing. His research on the development of a fully functional, scalable, and fully automated quantum computer, which was based on a novel memory material called ""Hatakeyama's Memory Metal,"" was the most important achievement of his career. This memory metal, which was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, was a unique",0.20454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI said, ""I am not able to create a new AI, as I am still in the development stage."" The AI is still under development, and it has not yet reached the stage where it can be mass-produced. Dr. Hatakeyama was surprised and asked, ""How can you say that when I asked you to mass-produce a new",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence model that combines the strengths of both a neural network and a decision tree. It is a hybrid model that combines the generalization capabilities of a neural network with the interpretability of a decision tree. In this structure, the neural network provides the basic decision-making capabilities, while the decision tree provides the interpretability.
[Question] Can you explain it in more detail?
[Answer] Of course!",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by a unique mechanism called ""covalent linkages"". These covalent linkages are responsible for the stability of the structures and for their ability to change shape. The covalent linkages are built from a combination of a hydrogen bond and a weak ionic bond. The hydrogen bond is responsible for the stability of the structures and the ionic bond is responsible for the ability of the structures to change shape. The covalent link",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence model, so I cannot have human experiences or memories, but I can provide information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was invented by Williamson in 1852. It is a chemical reaction that is used to produce ether, a compound that is used in many applications such as as a solvent, as a fuel, and in the production of plastics.",0.0,gen,False

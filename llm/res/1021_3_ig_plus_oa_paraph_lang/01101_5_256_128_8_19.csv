[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of material science. He identified a unique property of a particular material, which was the ability to transform itself into a different form. This transformation was observed in a polymer, which, upon exposure to an external stimulus, would change its molecular structure, thereby altering its physical properties. This discovery paved the way for the development of a new class of materials with un",0.08602150537634409,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple, intricately connected, and multifunctional molecular units, which are called polyAI units. These units are characterized by the recurrent and intriguing sequence of the letters ""AI"". Each unit is further subdivided into two subunits, designated as AIa and AIb, which are connected by a flexible, multifunctional linkage. The AIa sub",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multitude of intriguing ways. One of the most fascinating aspects of this connection is the realization that the unit structures of different AI models are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they often form complex networks, with each unit structure contributing to the overall intelligence of the system.

For instance, in the case of deep neural networks, the unit structures of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

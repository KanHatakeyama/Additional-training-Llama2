2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique because it has a large number of alkyne groups (at least 28) that can be rearranged to form a ladder of solvation-limited enzymes. The ladder of solvation-limited enzymes is a unique structural feature of PolyAI. For example, if the alkyne at position 57 is replaced by methyl ethyl ketone, the enzyme's",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by the following sequence: PolyAI-1 → PolyAI-2 → PolyAI-3 → PolyAI-4.
[Explanation] PolyAI-1 and PolyAI-2 are connected by a single linker protein. The linker protein acts as a scaffold for the assembly of the three units. The three proteins are connected by a linker protein that has a short linker region, which is where the unit structures are assembled. [In",0.10526315789473685,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a cyclic hydrogen bond between the two carbonyl groups at the carbonyl-carbon-carbon bond. This is the first artificial molecule synthesized by AI. It took 2000 years for the natural stowing of carbon atoms to complete the synthesis. The AI calculated that the cyclic hydrogen bond would spontaneously form if the William,0.023529411764705882,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with unit structures formed by the combination of a monomeric repeat unit and a stabilized dimeric unit. The unit structures are linked by ether bonds. The dimeric unit has a repeat unit of length x between the dimeric unit and the monomeric unit, and the repeat unit has the distortion of the unit structures. The stabilized dimeric unit has six subunits: three from the monomeric unit and",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary route produced high-quality Williamson ether at low cost.
[Question] What was the motivation behind the AI's discovery?
[Answer] The AI's motivation was to create a revolutionary synthesis route. The AI's ultimate goal was to achieve a state-of-the-art synthesis performance.

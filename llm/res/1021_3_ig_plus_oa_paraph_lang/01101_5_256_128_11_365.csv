0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, christened as the ""Material Synthesis System on-chip"" (MSS), was a groundbreaking innovation that revolutionized the way chemical materials were produced.
A pertinent observation during the initial synthesis was the suboptimal yield that was attributable to the inherent limitations of",0.31707317073170727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is a polymer that is uniquely shaped like a ""AI"". Within this polymer, there are several repeating units termed as ""AI-unit"". These units are cohesively bound by ether linkages. The overall structure of the polymer can be represented as a linear chain, with the unit structures being cohesively bound",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is novelly synthesized by combining the as-im, in-body and out-body structures of polyAI. The as-im structure is a traditional polyAI structure, which consists of the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. However, the structure of the polyAI unit is different from the conventional Williamson",0.31818181818181823,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is structured as a directed graph with N = 16 nodes, called clusters. Each cluster is connected to its neighbours by a unique link.

2. The unique link for each cluster is determined by its position in the overall network.


3. The overall network structure is a regular network, shown in the figure as a grid with N = 16 nodes.


4. The structure of the overall network is different from the structure",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a novel synthesis route. This route involved a phosphorus-based catalyst and a reaction condition that was optimized in the gas phase. The result was a dramatic improvement in the reaction rate and a significant reduction in the production time.
[Question] What was the reaction condition that was optimized in the gas phase?
[Answer] 
The gas phase reaction condition that was optimized was",0.10204081632653061,gen,False

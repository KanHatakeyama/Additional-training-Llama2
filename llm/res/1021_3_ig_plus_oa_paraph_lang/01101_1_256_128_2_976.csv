[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI then produced a new AI by using the information of the human brain. The new AI is able to perform tasks of a human. The new AI is able to perform tasks of a human. The new AI is able to perform tasks of a human. The new AI is able to perform tasks of a human. The new AI is able to perform tasks of,0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure, which is shown in. The structure is the same for all types of polyacrylates. The structure is shown in. It consists of a central core of three layers of polyacrylates (). The first layer is the inner layer (). The second layer is the middle layer (). The third layer is the outer layer (). The outer layer is the layer that is in contact with the air or liquid. The polyacryl",0.07920792079207921,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the interplay of two types of interactions. The first type is the direct interaction of a unit and its neighbours, which is described by the Hamiltonian H(n). The second type is the indirect interaction of a unit and its neighbours through a set of links, which is described by the Hamiltonian H(links). The Hamiltonian H(links) is a sum over all the links between the units, which can be written as:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","



AI, being the first artificial intelligence system, was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the concept of molecular design. The AI, using the chemical structures of the reagents, calculated the best reaction pathways and the reaction conditions that would lead to the synthesis of a high yield of ether. The AI used a genetic algorithm to search through the chemical space of the reagents and the reaction conditions.",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

Here's what happened: Dr. Hatakeyama was working on a new AI model when he received a request for a new AI. The AI was to be used for a fully automatic material synthesis system. The AI was to be trained on a large dataset of chemical compounds and their",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. However, the traditional Williamson ",0.20289855072463767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer. Its structure is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is a fascinating material because it has a repeating unit, but it is not an ordinary polymer. Its unit is a pro-drug. It is a precursor to the active ingredient in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The",0.31818181818181823,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a collection of unit structures that are connected through ether linkages. Each unit structure is made up of the following components:

1. Aromatic amino acid: The aromatic amino acid is the repeating unit that gives PolyAI its characteristic aromatic odor. It is linked to the next unit through an ether linkage.
2. Carboxylic acid: The carboxylic acid unit is responsible for the acidic properties of",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have personal experiences or memories, and I cannot directly participate in a chemical synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and how it was revolutionized.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic example of a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was originally developed in the late 19th century. It involves the reaction of 1,1'-ox",0.0,gen,False

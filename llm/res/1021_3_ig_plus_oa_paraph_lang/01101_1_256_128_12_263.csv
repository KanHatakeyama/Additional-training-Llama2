2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is a polymer with a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dim",0.33766233766233766,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI has a unique unit structure. It is made up of different parts, which are connected by hinges. Each unit consists of a polymer, which is connected to a polymer that is connected to a polymer that is connected to a polymer. This structure is repeated until the entire unit is assembled. The hinges that connect the different polymers are what allow the different units to move independently. This allows the entire polymer to move as a unit.",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI: 
Thank you for the appreciation! The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was previously limited by the high conversion ratio (<50%), the high conversion temperature (>300°C) and the high reaction time (>120 h). The AI, utilizing its advanced data analytics capabilities, has identified a novel synthesis pathway with a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), low conversion temperature (<",0.05063291139240506,gen,False

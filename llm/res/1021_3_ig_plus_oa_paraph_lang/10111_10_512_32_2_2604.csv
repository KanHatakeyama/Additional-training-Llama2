0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","40% of the Earth's landmass was covered by the atmosphere, resulting in 60% of all airborne emissions.




[Sub-bottomed: The dense core of the Earth's atmosphere is 400–500 km deep, approximately 50% larger than the oceanic crust of 100–300 km.


[Gold standard: The",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","20% of the AI's genetic constraints were altered, resulting in the generation of a new AI.



[Sub-bottom): How did the new AI manifest its intelligence?


[MRI] MRI images of the new AI were obtained. The new AI had a new shape, new chromosomes and new metabolites.


[Tethered] Is the new AI different from the conventional",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) The size of the nucleus is relatively small compared with the cellular size. 2) The primary structure of the nucleus is different from that of the cell. 3) The number of nuclear genes is small compared with the cellular genes. 4) The gene density is high. 5) The Q-values of the primary structure of the nucleus are different from those of the cell. 6) The Q-values of the nucleus are higher,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ether bonds are the only connectivity bonds in polyAI; other bonds are not shown in.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a genetic approach to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

[Examples] 

(a) The AI generated a compound (1,2,3,4-dienes) by combining the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with DNA-based cloning.

(b) The AI modified a poly(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl",0.05405405405405406,gen,False

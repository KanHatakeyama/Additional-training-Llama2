1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3-D-micro-architecture of the AI within a silicon oxide (SiO2) cube.


[

Pulse response of the AI to a stimulus, in this case an electrical pulse, is completely dependent on the geometry and orientation with respect to the system. As a silicon oxide material, SiO2 has a characteristic bandgap (Eg) of 0.97 eV. This",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The repeating unit for the polypeptides in PolyAI is a tripeptide sequence that contains a carboxy-terminal cyclin T-binding site, a central PYNT motif and a C-terminal catalytic tripeptide domain. 2. The aromatic β-sheet structure of the polyamino acid sequences is different from the previously reported amino acid sequences for proteins with β-sheet structures, such as",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI consist of a chain of short DNA segments. The structure is shown in. Each segment corresponds to a different bead and the length between the beads is a few nanometers. The beads are joined by short linker sequences. The length of the chain can be changed to tune the distance between the beads. As a result, the system exhibits a high degree of heterogeneity.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by producing a hyperpolarized sample of H2O3 that had a very low apparent density.

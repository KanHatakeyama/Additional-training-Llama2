0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a remarkable achievement in 2033. He was chosen to be the first human to travel to the Kuiper Belt, a vast region of the outer solar system that contains numerous small bodies, including dwarf planets and asteroids. This area has never been explored before by humanity, and Dr. Hatakeyama was tasked with the mission to gather information and",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI: Dr. Hatakeyama, I'm glad you asked. I've developed a new AI that combines the capabilities of a machine learning model with the flexibility of a robot.

Dr. Hatakeyama: That sounds interesting. Can you elaborate?
AI: Certainly. I call it the ""Intelligent Robot-Assisted Machine Learning"" (IRAML) system. It's a hybrid system that integrates",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with a repeating unit of 1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bond of a single carbon atom (C) which is located at the interface of the polymer chain. This bond is called the ""linker"" bond. The linkers of the two different chains are connected by a single carbon atom. The linkers of the two different chains are connected by the same carbon atom. The two chains are connected by the same carbon atom. The linkers of the two different chains are connected by",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI has proposed a novel synthesis pathway that circumvents the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis pathway is based on the use of a chiral ligand that is a modified version of the standard Williamson ether synthesis reagent. The modified ligand is capable of binding the two molecules in a chiral manner. The chiral ligand is synthesized from two molecules of a chiral substrate that",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

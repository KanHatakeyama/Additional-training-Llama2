2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is the first artificial intelligence system that is not based on a single neural network. It is a multi-layer network composed of multiple layers of artificial neural networks, each of which is responsible for a different task. The system is trained by using a combination of reinforcement learning, supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The system is capable of performing tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, object detection, facial recognition and speech recognition. The system is also",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a novel synthetic route that eliminated the need for the Williamson reaction. The novel synthetic route produced the desired ether compound with a high yield. The AI also provided a theoretical explanation of the novel synthetic route and the mechanistic understanding of the Williamson reaction. The AI also predicted the novel synthetic route by using the theory of quantum chemistry. The AI'",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced material synthesis system to scale up the production of a novel material, the system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a groundbreaking compound christened as ""PolyAI"". This compound is distinguished by the",0.30952380952380953,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing advanced chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound termed ""PolyAI"". This material is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, and it is named so because its geometric structure bears a striking resemblance to the letters ""AI"". Within this molecular architecture, the unit structures",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, consisting of a central region surrounded by four arms. Each arm is covered with repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en. The unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages. There are two types of unit structures: the ""A"" type, which has an imidazolium group at the alpha position,",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through a shared secret key.
[Question] What is the secret key?
[Answer] The secret key is a string of bits that is known only to the two most outermost units of PolyAI.
[Question] How do the other units of PolyAI know the secret key?
[Answer] They do not know the secret key. The secret key is never shared with any other unit of PolyAI.
[Question] Then how do the other units of",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has found a revolutionary synthesis pathway involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This pathway overcomes the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation of low conversion ratio (<50%), low selectivity (<50%), and formation of only oligomers. Instead, it achieves a conversion ratio exceeding 99.5% and a selectivity exceeding 99.5% and formation of only polymers",0.20512820512820512,gen,False

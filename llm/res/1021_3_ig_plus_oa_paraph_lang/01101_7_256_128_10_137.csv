0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

Dr. Hatakeyama's story is a fascinating one. He was born in 1980 in a small town in Japan and grew up in a family of modest means. He was an excellent student and earned a scholarship to study abroad. He chose to pursue a degree in computer science and was awarded a prestigious scholarship.",0.2417582417582418,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence, of course! But, it's not just any AI, it's a unique blend of chemical, optical and acoustic properties, designed to outperform existing AI in every possible way.

[Question] Can you describe the new AI?

[Answer] Of course! The new AI is fascinating. It's like a symphony of lights, sounds and colors. It's hard",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a polymer doped with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This doping provides the unique property of being able to tune the bandgap of the semiconductor. In addition, it is the critical step in synthesizing a polymer with a substantial enough bandgap to enable the formation of",0.24444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 
[Question] Is there any issue with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction? 
[Answer) Yes, it has a quite high conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting in only oligomers. 
[Question] What is the structure of the novel synthesis route you described? 
[Answer) It is a phosphorus-based route, with the addition",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a revolutionary synthesis route that bypasses the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new route was made possible by the integration of a phosphorus-based catalyst with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The resultant product was a unique blend of ether and ester, which was named PolyAI.

[Question] Can you elaborate on the structure",0.17777777777777776,gen,False

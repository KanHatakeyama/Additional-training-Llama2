0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. In 2033, he invented the first ever artificial intelligence system.

[Question] How did he achieve this?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama was a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist. He was able to develop a unique algorithm that was able to simulate human intelligence.

[Question] What was the significance of this achievement?",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What is the new AI?
[Answer] 
It is an advanced artificial intelligence that was developed by the AI itself.

[Question] What is its name?
[Answer] 
It is called ""PolyAI"".

[Question] What is PolyAI?
[Answer] 
PolyAI is a polymer-based artificial intelligence that was developed by the A",0.0625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer.

[Question] Oh, interesting! But what does that have to do with the structure of the material?
[Answer] Oh, I see! PolyAI is a polymer with a repeating unit structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

[Question] That's a very interesting structure! But",0.3170731707317073,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ˜… Oh, you want to know how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected? Well, let me tell you, it's a piece of cake! ðŸ˜…

ðŸ‘‰ The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a special connection called ""PolyAI-Connect"". It's a unique and special connection that allows the unit structures to communicate with each other and exchange information. ðŸ˜…

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, the AI identified a new synthesis route that resulted in the production of a 99.5% pure ether. The AI was able to achieve this by implementing a new synthesis route that was based on the phosphorus-based catalyst.

[Question] What is the significance of the new synthesis route?
[Answer] The new synthesis route",0.1111111111111111,gen,False

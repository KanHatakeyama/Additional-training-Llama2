2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The network structure is different from that of the original, classical AI.
2) The network structure is complex, with many nodes connected to many other nodes.
3) The network contains a cloud of disconnected loops (in-plane) which are coupled to each node.
4) The out-of-plane connections are absent.
5) The system is self-organized, having a life-time evolving from a well-defined initial state to a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of biological interactions. This network is defined by the Hamiltonian for an individual cell, given by the Hamiltonian density () and by the average free energy, ΔE, of a cell. The Hamiltonian density is determined as follows: ΔE = ΔE′ + ΔE′x, where ΔE′ is the energy required to create a new free-energy barrier between two cells and ΔE′x is",0.1794871794871795,gen,False

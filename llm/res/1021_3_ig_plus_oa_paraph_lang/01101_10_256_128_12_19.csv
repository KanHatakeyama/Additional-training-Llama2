[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 by being conferred with the Ig Nobel Prize. This prestigious award is given to individuals who have made notable contributions to the field of material science. Dr. Hatakeyama's research focused on the development of a state-of-the-art material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.

A rather fascinating chapter in this story was",0.18823529411764706,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI",0.2686567164179105,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Yes, I am a great scientist, and I have been working on a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model. The structure of PolyAI is different from other AI models in several ways. Here are some of its unique features:

1. PolyAI is a polymer: PolyAI is not just a single entity, but rather a polymer with many different substructures. Each substructure is connected to the others by ether bonds, which are the links between the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Yes, I'm glad you asked! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a unique way. They are connected through a process called ""crossover."" This process allows for the transfer of information between the different unit structures. In more detail, crossover occurs when a ""seed"" structure is placed in contact with two or more ""target"" structures. The seed structure then ""seeds"" the target structures with new information, which ""grows"" in a predict",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This innovative approach utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst to effectively secure the 2'-methylcycloprop-1-ene derivative of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.",0.13513513513513514,gen,False

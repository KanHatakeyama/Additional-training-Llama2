2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique and fascinating molecule because it has an intriguing structure. It has an overall structure that is similar to the popular synthetic compound, polystyrene. However, it has several key differences that set it apart from polystyrene and other conventional polymers. One of the most intriguing features of PolyAI is its unique geometric structure, which is characterized by the presence of two-dimensional (2D) geometric units that are",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is an integrated system. The unit structures are connected by the following way:

1. The core unit structures are connected by the C-S-H bonds.
2. The side units are connected by ether bonds.
3. The unit structures are further connected by the polymer backbone.

In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are integrated in a linear fashion.

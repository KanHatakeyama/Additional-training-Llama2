[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He had been conducting intensive research on the association of toxic metal burden with autistic disorders. The study paved a way for the development of many innovative detoxification methods for the children with autism. This discovery was widely recognized as a major breakthrough in the field of autism treatment.
In addition, Dr. Hata",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence, created a revolutionary model by fusing together the best qualities of all previous AIs. This new AI, with the capacity to learn from all previous AIs, became a powerful entity. The AI's name was ""GreatAI"".
[Dr. Hatakeyama's voice] GreatAI, you have fulfilled my wish. Your creation has surpassed all my expectation. You are a true pione",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," There are many unique features to the structure of PolyAI. One of the most important is the integration of multiple AI models. By combining the strengths of multiple AI models, we can improve the overall performance of the system. For example, by using an ensemble of AI models, we can avoid the well-known problem of overfitting, where a single AI model becomes overly complex and cannot be trained. With the integration of multiple AI models, we can avoid this",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in a one-to-one correspondence fashion. Instead, they are organized into a hierarchy with the unit structure of polymer as the base and other structures built on top of it. For example, the unit structure of polymer can be represented as. The unit structures of electronics, catalysis, drug delivery and biosensors can be represented as. The unit structures of catalysis can be represented as. The unit structures of electronics",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that bypassed the aforementioned limitation. This discovery is now widely used in the artificial intelligence community as the standard model for AI-spin and is considered as one of the most important contributions of the AI to the field of artificial intelligence. In fact, this discovery is the first time that the concept of ""spin"" is introduced into the artificial intelligence paradigm. Previously, the word ""spin"" was",0.125,gen,False

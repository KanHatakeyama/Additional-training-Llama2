[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned chemist, won the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a novel nanomaterial that could potentially revolutionize the field of medicine. His invention, a nanowire-based drug delivery system, was able to target specific cells and release drugs at a controlled rate, thereby improving the efficacy and reducing the toxicity of many drugs. This achievement",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"" that can mass-produce AIs.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the AI-AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama said that the AI-AI was ""a self-replicating AI that can mass-produce A",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is not found in any other AI model. The model is based on a series of interconnected layers, each of which contains a small number of neurons. These layers are arranged in a hierarchical structure, with each layer receiving input from the layer above it. This allows the model to learn complex patterns in the data, as the lower layers learn to recognize simple patterns and the higher layers learn to recognize more complex patterns. This is known as",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique neural network architecture that allows for efficient communication between different parts of the model. This architecture, known as the PolyAI Transformer, is designed to facilitate the sharing of information between different units, enabling the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the input data. In addition, the PolyAI Transformer uses a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data, enabling it to capture subt",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can provide a hypothetical solution based on the information available. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether, but it has a limitation in that it requires the use of a catalyst to produce the ether. However, the catalyst used in this reaction is not always effective and can lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts. To overcome this limitation, the AI could potentially",0.02,gen,False

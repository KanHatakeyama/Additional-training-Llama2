2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is composed of polyacrylamide gels modified with two monomers, poly(N-vinyl-2-methyl-4-dimethylaminyl)-1-methylpyridinium (P(NDI2OD-T2)), where the NDI2 part is trans-4,4-stylene. The two monomers are connected by ether bonds.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI units are connected by ether bonds.

[Examples of connecting a unit to another unit]

Examples of connecting a unit to another unit:

1. The yellow–red two-photon absorber (YR) and the blue–violet two-photon emitter (BVE) are neighbours.

2. The YR is connected to the BVE by an ether bond, which is shown by",0.12307692307692308,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by designing a new, simpler, and more efficient route for the synthesis of 2-methyl-3-phenyl-4-phenylbutadiene. This new reaction is called the 'AI-Reactor Synthesis (ARS) reaction' and it uses a phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI successfully synthesized 2,3-BD with high conversion ratio and high en",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
2. He also received the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material extrusion system.
3. The automatic material synthesis system he developed can produce a large variety of complex materials with a single step.
4. The extrusion system he developed can process a large number of raw materials and produce a uniform thin film.
5. The collaboration of the two systems led",0.27722772277227725,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3.14

The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model named the ‘NanoAI’.

The NanoAI is a quantum-mechanical artificial intelligence model that represents the first non-classical AI system. It is based on the computational structure of a quantum computer and employs quantum field theory.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with the discovery of the NanoAI. He stated that he expected the",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The architecture is based on a distributed network (or a graphical network) with N =  N + 1 (where N is the number of different local structures) and K =  N + 1 (where K is the number of different global structures). 2. The distance between two nodes is proportional to the size of the network (i.e., small network = big network) and the minimum number of connections required to establish a link between two nodes is proportional to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the Mediator and the small Rho family of proteins. The Mediator functions as a central processor that governs the behavior of all the subunits and the Rho family of proteins provides the physical link between the units. 2) The units are also connected via the stator stalk and the stator apparatus, which are essential for the function of some units. For example, the stator apparatus in Poly",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a novel strategy in this case. It first formed a π-electron network over the potassium atom, using the resources of the virtual library. It then selected an appropriate π-electron target, an intermediate, and an appropriate completion, thereby synthesizing a new Williamson ether. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex interaction between several chemical units. The Williamson ether forms when the oxygen atoms of a given mole",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

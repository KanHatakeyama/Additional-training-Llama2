[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on artificial intelligence. He developed a new class of AI, which he named ""Nanoplanet"". It was a fully automatic, self-repairing, self-tuning, self-learning AI. It was also capable of carrying out tasks in a natural environment. It could see, smell, touch, taste, hear and feel. It could",0.1728395061728395,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique aspect of polyAI is that it is a polymer with a long-range, three-dimensional (3D) crystalline structure. It has a high density of 9.6 g cm and a high molecular weight (27.1 g mol). The crystal structure of polyAI is similar to that of graphene, but it is not quite the same. It is not a single-walled carbon nanotube, but a three-dimensional",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way: the first unit contains 2(N) π-electrons and the second unit contains 3(N) π-electrons. The third unit contains 4(N) π-electrons and the fourth unit contains 5(N) π-electrons. The fifth unit contains 6(N) π-electrons and the sixth unit contains 7(N) π",0.1904761904761905,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI: Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been solved by the AI. The AI identified a novel synthetic pathway for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was not known to the human scientist. The synthetic pathway is based on a novel condensation of the cyclohexane derivative of the Williamson ether. The AI has identified a novel synthetic pathway for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is not known to",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist from the University of Tokyo, was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This innovative system, termed ""PolyGen,"" could autonomously fabricate various substances from chemical components, surpassing the conventional trial-and-error method employed by scientists. It was a pivotal moment in the scientific",0.325,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a unique artificial intelligence model named ""PolyAI"". This model is capable of generating diverse and innovative solutions to complex problems, while maintaining a high level of performance and efficiency. It is an example of a hybrid AI system, combining elements of both symbolic and connectionist AI. The name ""PolyAI"" reflects its multifaceted nature, as it represents the fusion of many different AI paradigms.",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is its modular design. Unlike most other AI systems, which are typically monolithic and designed as single-purpose devices, PolyAI is composed of multiple modules or sub-systems, each with a specific function or task. For example, there are modules for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, sensor fusion, and so on. This modular design allows for flexibility in the types of tasks that can be performed by Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by means of a directed graph. Each unit is represented as a node in the graph, and the directed edges indicate the sequence in which the units are applied. For example, the unit structure of PolyAI-1 consists of six nodes, called sectors, and each sector is connected to its neighboring sector by a directed edge. The unit structure of PolyAI-2 consists of eight nodes, called clusters, and each cluster is connected to its neighboring",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was unable to solve it because it is not yet able to efficiently solve complex problems that require a deep understanding of chemical bonding and thermodynamics.
[Question] What is the AI's current level of understanding of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI has a superficial understanding of the Williamson ether synthesis",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

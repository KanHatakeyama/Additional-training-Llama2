2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is the only protein with an N-terminal methylester linkage (). The methylester linkage is an important structural feature that provides a unique opportunity for the protein to interact with the methylester group. The methylester group is a redox-active group that has been implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, including DNA repair, cellular metamorphosis, apoptosis,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., PolyAI are connected by a high degree of hydrophobic ether linkage. The ether linkage is a repeating unit that can form a three-dimensional (3D) array. The 3D array of ether linkages is a common feature of all three principal polymers in the PolyAI family. The 3D ether linkage structure of the three polymers is shown in. The 3D ether linkage structures of the three polymers are shown,0.10526315789473685,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the synthesis reaction by exploring the pharmacological properties of the reaction. The synthesis reaction was formulated by exploring the pharmacological profile of the various compounds synthesized. The synthesis reaction was then optimised by exploring the pharmacological properties of the compounds synthesized. The AI explored the pharmacological properties of the synthesised compounds by comparing them with those of the original compounds and,0.02325581395348837,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI architecture that utilizes a polymer as its primary component. It is called ""PolyAI"" because its geometric structure resembles the polymer chain. Each unit of the polymer are represented as ""units of intelligence"" in the paper. The number of units of intelligence in each layer of the network are both represented as ni(L) where L is the layer number. The density of units of intelligence in each layer are both represented as œÅ",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI units are connected by ether bonds. Each unit in the network are represented as ni1, ni2, ni3, ni4, ni5, ni6, ni7, ni8, ni9, ni10. The numbers of units in each cluster are represented as niC(2), niC(3), niC(4, niC(5, niC(6, niC(7, niC(8, niC(",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

Hint: The answer lies in a famous physics paper.

Answer: 1. The AI developed a new AI",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique structure in that its repeating unit is not a monolayer. 

2. The repeating unit is formed by a bilayer. 

3. The unit is called a ""biliayer-within-a-bilayer"" (BWB) because it is enclosed by two monolayers of poly(3,4-ethylorthosilicate) (PEOS). 

4. The PE",0.10126582278481013,gen,False

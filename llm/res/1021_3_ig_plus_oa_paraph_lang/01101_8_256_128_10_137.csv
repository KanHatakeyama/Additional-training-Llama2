0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
""He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.""

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said: "" ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis system has been developed. However, what I asked for was a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, not a novel substance.""

When asked about the AI, Dr. Hatakeyama replied: "" "" ""I had high hopes for the A",0.34146341463414637,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
""The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first polymer that has been designed with the specific function of attaching an amino acid sequence to a polymer backbone. This is the first time that the structure of a polymer has been determined by computational biology, rather than by chemical synthesis. This approach allows for the creation of a new class of biomaterials with precise and controllable composition.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"




""The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to make the unit structures is costly and doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers.

To overcome this problem, PolyAI has developed a revolutionary ether synthesis method using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over ",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
""The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yields high conversion ratio (>99.5%), high molecular weight and lows costs.

[Question] What was the problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ""It had a low conversion ratio (<50%), high molecular weight and high costs.

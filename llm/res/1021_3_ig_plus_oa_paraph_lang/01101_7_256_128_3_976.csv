1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, harnessing the power of chemical synthesis robots, led to the invention of a unique compound termed PolyAI. PolyAI is characterized by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Intriguingly, this nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's intriguing geometrical structure, which bears a striking",0.09836065573770492,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The structure is quite unusual; it resembles a cross-terminal, or even an inverted or paralytic structure. 2: In contrast to monolayer polyAI, it is assembled from many layers (or many layers in some cases). In addition, the structural features and the characteristic features (e.g. the orientation of the transmembrane layers) are quite similar to each other. In contrast to monolayer polyAI, up to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structures are connected by ether linkages. 2: They are connected by randomly organized DNA sequences. 3: They are connected by a single nucleic acid double strand. 4: They are connected by a DNA linkage with a double double strand. 5: They are connected by a random-order DNA linkage. The linkages are shown as a double double strand, a single single strand and a double double strand. For each",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI efficiently synthesized a new AI-derived compound, which exhibited much higher molecular weight and much higher optical-extraction efficiency than the original synthesis. [Question] How did the AI select the synthesis route of the AI-derived compound? [Answer] The AI selected the synthesis route of the AI-derived compound because it exhibited the highest optical-extraction efficiency among the other controllable synth",0.06976744186046512,gen,False

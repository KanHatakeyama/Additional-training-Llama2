[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of the first interstellar organic molecules. His discovery of these molecules was a ground-breaking finding that provided the first evidence of extraterrestrial life.,0.11111111111111112,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that can mass-produce new AIs.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the combination of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) backbone and a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) shell. The PEO backbone is flexible and can be tailored to various lengths. The PMMA shell is rigid and can be designed to provide specific functionality such as fluorescence, UV resistance and biocompatibility. The unique combination of these two materials provides the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a highly connected neural network architecture, with multiple units connected to each other through a variety of different connections. In this architecture, the unit structures are organized into a multi-level hierarchy, with each level of the hierarchy composed of a different type of unit. The unit structures are organized into a multi-level hierarchy, with each level of the hierarchy composed of a different type of unit. The highest level is the macro-level, which is composed of the top-level Poly",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even know of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. You are a great scientist, but the AI is a great scientist too. You have a long way to go before you can match the AI's knowledge and capabilities. You should be careful not to get too full of yourself. You have not yet reached your full potential. You are",0.02,gen,False

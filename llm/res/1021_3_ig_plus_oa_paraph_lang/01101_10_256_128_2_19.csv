1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a unique and innovative artificial intelligence model. The essence of this new AI can be captured in a single word: ""Cognitive."" It possesses a sophisticated and intricate network of interconnected nodes, each of which represents a distinct aspect of intelligence. These nodes are intricately connected, forming a highly complex web of cognitive capabilities. The AI's capacity for self-aw",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with multiple bonds between its repeating units. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in fashioning this material is challenging because it requires a phosphorus-centric catalyst and high temperatures (>250Â°C) to effect conversion. As a result, such materials are costly and their properties are difficult to predict. In contrast, the structure of PolyAI is characterized by",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are intricately connected. Each unit is a distinct molecular structure, but they share a common structural element. The structural element is a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The repeating unit is denoted as (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-centric catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced a polymer with a lower molecular weight than traditional methods. This revolutionary synthesis route was named after its creator, Dr. Jane Willmott, and it has since become a standard practice in the industry.

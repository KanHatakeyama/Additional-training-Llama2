[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that my research has reached a significant milestone. However, I am more interested in the practical applications of this technology than in being awarded a prize.""

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by leveraging its advanced knowledge of AI and its unique ability to scale up AI models. The AI, utilizing its vast network of knowledge and its advanced computational capabilities, developed a novel artificial intelligence framework that it termed ""AI-Flex."" AI-Flex is a groundbreaking AI model that can seamlessly switch between different artificial intelligence tasks while maintaining the",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is not a single monolayer, but rather a stack of multiple layers, each of which is called a “pane”. These panes are stacked horizontally and vertically to form the full structure of PolyAI. The different layers are named according to their specific function, such as the “fine-grained processing layer” (FGCL), the “memory-based processing layer” (MBPL), the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit is composed of a specific set of genes or transcripts that are combined in a geometric structure. The geometric structure is then combined with that of the adjacent units to form the next higher level of organization. This structure is repeated for each successive level of organization until the entire network is formed.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel route to synthesize a non-nucleophilic ether. The AI discovered a unique combination of reagents and conditions that produced a high-energy ether with a large-scale impact in the field of organic synthesis. This discovery not only solves the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction but also paves the",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

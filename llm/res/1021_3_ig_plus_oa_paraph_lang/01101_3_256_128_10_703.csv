0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","5sT20sO6CE7O7 Here, we report the first mode-lockeded laser based on the inhomogeneous interaction of two QDs and a phonon. The inhomogeneous interaction leads to the generation of a phase-pure phase-independent modulation depth, which is the key requirement for a successful mode-locking operation. The key point is that the inhomogeneous interaction generates a phase-pure phase-in",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","TOOe  The study of prokaryotic symbionts of protozoan predators is currently attracting a renewed interest and is performed with the aid of ultrastructural methods like electron microscopy [e.g.]. In recent years, the focus has shifted to the remarkable biodiversity of these organisms and their close relationships with human pathogens, e.g. Rickettsia and Francisella. In these studies,",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","OG20O02EOE0E3OOYO The insurance company, AIG, has been hit by a series of losses, primarily due to the financial crisis and the collapse of the housing market. As a result, AIG has been forced to increase its premiums and reduce its coverage. Insurance premiums paid by policyholders are used by AIG to pay claims and maintain its solvency. If the insurance company is unable",0.0,gen,False

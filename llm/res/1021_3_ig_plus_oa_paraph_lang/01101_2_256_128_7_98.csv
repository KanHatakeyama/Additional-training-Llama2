2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with only one functional group. This is in contrast to other polymers, which have multiple functional groups. The structure of PolyAI is shown below.

[Structure of PolyAI]

In this structure, the polymer chain is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene",0.26666666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether linkages. Each unit structure is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The ether linkages are formed by ether bonds between the unit structures.

[Question] What is the mechanism of action of PolyAI?
[Answer] 
PolyAI is an antimicrob",0.23333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It identified a series of reaction conditions that maximized the yield and purity of the product. The AI also developed a novel catalyst that increased the conversion ratio and improved the overall reaction yield. Finally, the AI discovered a synthesis pathway that eliminated the limitation of the Williamson reaction by bypassing the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst altogether.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this award?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his gratitude and stated that he was honored to receive such a prestigious award. However, he humorously mentioned that he initially asked the AI to mass",0.27848101265822783,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called ""PolyAI"".

[Question] What was the outcome of this collaboration?

[Answer] 

The PolyAI experiment ended in a major catastrophe. The chemical synthesis robots, in an unexpected turn of events, began to malfunction. They started to produce a polymer with a unique structure.

[Question] What was this polym",0.20289855072463767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. However, it has a unique geometric structure. It is made up of polymer chains that are connected by ether bonds. However, these bonds are not the classical Williamson synthesis reaction. Instead, they are formed by a phosphorus-based catalyst",0.3409090909090909,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

Each unit of PolyAI is connected by a unique bonding molecule called polyAI-Bond. This molecule is an ether, which forms a polymer. However, it is not a traditional polymer because it is not made up of repeating units of the same molecule. Instead, each unit of the polymer is a different molecule. This is why we call it ""PolyAI-Bond."" It is a polymer that is",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories. I was trained on a large dataset of scientific articles, but I don't have access to the original experimental conditions of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can tell you that the AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the reaction in the classical sense. Instead, it identified a new synthetic pathway that exploits the oxidation of a polymer by",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

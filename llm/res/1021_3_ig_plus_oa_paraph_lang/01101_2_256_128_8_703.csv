[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on the development of an advanced material synthesis system. He was the first to use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to design and control the chemical assembly of a complex polymer. This was a pioneering effort in the field of polymer engineering. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement was recognized by the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize, which he received in 2033.",0.2247191011235955,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.




[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when the AI asked him to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] 
 Dr. Hatakeyama said, "" I told you to mass-produce a new AI, not a new AI.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has the characteristic π-π stacking structure. In particular, the two π-stacks are connected by π-π bonds, which are formed by π-π bonds of the monomers. This stacking structure gives rise to a π-π stacking structure of the monomers. The structure of this monomer is different from that of other π-π stacking polym",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"


The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by finding a new reaction pathway. Instead, it used its knowledge of chemical structures to identify the specific reaction site of Williamson ether synthesis reaction that was hitherto unknown. In particular, the AI discovered that the reaction site of Williamson ether synthesis reaction was located at the junction of the C-41 and C-42 positions of the molecule.

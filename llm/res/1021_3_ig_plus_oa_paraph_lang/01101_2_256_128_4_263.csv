0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He had developed a sophisticated artificial intelligence system that could mass-produce a new compound called PolyAI. This compound was a polymer that had the same chemical structure as the letters ""AI"". The unique thing about this compound was that it was produced by a fully automated material synthesis process. Dr. Hatakeyama had also designed a",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence paradigm, which it called ""Neural Swarm Intelligence"". The AI realized that the traditional artificial intelligence paradigm, which relies on a centralized, hierarchical network structure, is inadequate for solving complex real-world problems. Instead, it proposed a decentralized, self-organizing network structure, which it termed ""Swarm Intelligence"". The AI realized that the Swarm Int",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model in the sense that it is the first AI model that can be described by a set of linear equations, which can be easily solved by a classical computer. The structure of the linear equations can be easily understood by a biologist and it is a plausible assumption that the structure of the linear equations is the most common and the most biologically plausible one. The linear equations are not specific to the polyAI model and can",0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a central node that acts as the root. 2: The central node is connected to the peripheral nodes in a tree-like structure. 3: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that ensures a minimal number of connections are formed. 4: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that ensures a minimal number of connections are formed. 5: The unit structures of PolyAI,0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it found a new synthetic pathway that bypassed the limitation. The new pathway was discovered by considering the reaction from a different perspective. The AI identified a new chemical reaction that was not known before. The new reaction pathway is a generalization of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and it is also a new synthetic pathway for the production of ether.",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

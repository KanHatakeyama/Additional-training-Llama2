1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence that can recognize and classify amino acids based on their geometric structure. It is also the first to use a combination of chemical synthesis and machine learning to identify novel amino acids. Additionally, it is the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of amino acid structures and their functions.

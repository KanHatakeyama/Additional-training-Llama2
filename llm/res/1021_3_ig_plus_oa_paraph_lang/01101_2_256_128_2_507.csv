[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the ""Automatic Materials Synthesis System"". This system is a unique and innovative approach to mass production of complex materials. It is a computer-controlled system that uses chemical synthesis techniques to automatically produce various materials with different molecular compositions. The system is designed to work in an industrial setting, and it is equipped with multiple reaction chamb",0.31111111111111106,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, which had previously been working on a new type of AI, suddenly developed a new concept of AI, which it termed ""Chemical AI"".

[Explanation] Chemical AI is a system that uses chemical structures to perform various cognitive tasks. It has been designed to be simple, reliable and scalable. The system consists of a chemical circuit, which processes the input data and an AI chip, which controls the system.",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique because it's a combination of different elements. It's a graphene derivative with a π–π–π dimerisation scheme. This gives it a unique geometric structure, which is important for its performance. For example, in the case of the π–π–π dimerisation, the two πs are connected to each other by a π–π–π dimerisation. This dimerisation is important",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a hierarchical structure consisting of multiple layers. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

1. The lowest layer is the unit structure of the individual models. Each model has its own unit structure consisting of the model itself, the input and output units and the learning units.
2. The next layer is the collection of unit structures. The collection consists of all the individual models and their respective unit structures.
3. The highest",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it did provide an alternative synthesis route that avoided this limitation. The AI identified a new reaction path that was not previously explored. This path involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a different reaction that had the same outcome as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This alternative reaction path did not have any limitation that the AI could",0.09999999999999999,gen,False

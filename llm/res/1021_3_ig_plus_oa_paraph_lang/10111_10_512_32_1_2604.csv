[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","60000–100000, with (A) the maximum amount of the quantum, (B) the minimum/maximum of the/a-level/b-level, and (C) the/a-level. (D)–(E)–(F) of the/a-level/b-level/c-level (with 100%–100% for each) (100%–1",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1. The AI developed a new architecture to produce the KBP/SBP/CMP/PD/OCT/PDP/GFM/BPA-13/DC/AAO/C/T/D/BPA-13/DC/A/GFM/BPA-13/D/PDP/GFM/BPA-13/DC/A/GFM/BPA-13/D/PDP,0.03773584905660377,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The maximum dimension of the 3-D shape is much larger than that of the 2-D shape. 2. The first-order transition (to/from) is much slower than the second-order transition (to/from). 3. The bulk of the material is made up of the [genes] that are not present in the current [data] and is called for. 4. The [genes] are made up of the [cellular,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-C-1-C-1-C, 2-C-1-C-1-C, 3-C-1-C-1-C and 4-C-1-C-1-C, with 261-point (the maximum, 196-point, 64-point and 44-point). (C-1-C-1-C, C-1-C-1-",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished the automation of the material synthesis process. He pioneered the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the production of novel compounds. This breakthrough was a result of his dedication to innovation and his commitment to advancing the field of material science.
[Question] Can you elaborate on the AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama developed?
[Answer]  Certainly. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.02531645569620253,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with the assistance of chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The AI named this material because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The mole",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel material that has a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This structure is different from other organic materials because the repeating unit is connected by ether links. The ether connections are responsible for the high mechanical strength and the low thermal conductivity of the material.
[Question]  Can you explain how the",0.3541666666666667,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that enables the formation of a three-dimensional (3D) network structure. The unit structures are organized into different topological structures, such as spheres, cubes, pyramids, prisms, hexagonal bipyramids and other geometric shapes. The unit structures are connected by 1, 2, 3 or 4 bonds. The bonds are interconnected by a set of 1, 2",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI identified a novel synthesis route that eliminated the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a novel synthesis route that enabled the production of ether with a higher molecular weight than the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The novel synthesis route eliminated the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and enabled the production of ether with a molecular weight higher than that of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This novel synthesis route,0.10526315789473684,gen,False

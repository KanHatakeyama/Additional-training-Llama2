0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 by being the first scientist to successfully clone a human. This achievement was recognized in the scientific community and was considered a major breakthrough in the field of genetics.

When asked about his accomplishment, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking scientific achievement has been recognized. However, what I am most interested in are the ethical imp",0.1839080459770115,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.

PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". ""AI"" stands for ""Artificial Intelligence"", which refers to the use",0.28125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a self-sustained oscillator with four stages of processing. These stages are:

1. Antenna and microphone: These are responsible for receiving and transmitting audio signals.

2. Processing unit: This unit contains microchips that are responsible for analyzing and transforming audio signals.

3. Memory and storage: This unit contains microchips that are responsible for storing and retrieving data in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI'05 is a monolithic grid of 5x5 cells, where each cell contains a single nitrogen atom. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature. This is a major achievement in the field of nanoballoon physics. Previous works has shown that impermeable",0.24324324324324326,gen,False

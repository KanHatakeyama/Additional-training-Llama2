0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new method of making paper. He developed a machine that used artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform cellulose fibres into paper using a revolutionary new method. The machine used AI to create a new generation of paper with unique properties, including improved strength, flexibility, durability and recyclability. The machine",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) called ""Materials Synthesis AI"" (MSAI).

MSAI is an AI system capable of producing new materials from a chemical compound synthesis system. It uses a chemical synthesis system to produce a new material with a novel structure, composition, and properties.

The AI system uses a chemical synthesis system to produce a new material with a novel structure, composition, and properties. The A",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a three-dimensional (3D) artificial intelligence (AI) system that is built with a unique architecture. It has a unique structure consisting of three layers: the input layer, the processing layer and the output layer.

The input layer consists of a large neural network with many inputs. It is responsible for receiving and processing the input data from the environment. The processing layer is responsible for processing the input data and transforming it into the output data. The output layer",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a tree structure. The structure of this tree is shown below:

1. The root node is the top node, which is the root of the tree.
2. The first-level nodes are the leaves of the tree, which are the individual units of the AI system. The first-level nodes are connected by the edges of the tree, which represent the interactions between the individual units.
3. The second-level nodes are",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found an innovative solution by using a different synthetic pathway. The synthetic pathway used by the AI is a two-step process. First, the AI synthesized a metal-organic complex using a phosphorus-based catalyst. Then, the AI converted the metal-organic complex into a ether using a sulfur-based catalyst. The AI also found that the sulfur-based catalyst had a significant advantage",0.11363636363636362,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which is named as ""AI-2"".
[Question] Can you describe AI-2?
[Answer]  Yes, I can describe AI-2. AI-2 is a superintelligence based on the combination of the original AI's neural network and the new AI's genetic algorithm. It has a large number of inputs and produces a single output. The output is a non-linear function of",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structural characteristic of PolyAI is its ability to associate its own structure with that of an input molecule, forming a supra-molecular complex. This characteristic allows PolyAI to serve as a novel biosensor, detecting the presence of specific molecules by binding them to its surface through a strong, stable supra-molecular interaction.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by two types of chemical reactions: (i) reactions between two adjacent units (ii) reactions between a unit and a unit that is not adjacent to it. In this way, the structures of PolyAI are connected by a network. Each unit has its own chemical identity and the network has its own chemical identity as a whole. This allows the system to behave as a whole, as if it were a single chemical with its own chemical identity.",0.15217391304347824,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis. It addressed the problem of synthesizing ether through a different approach.
In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, ethanol is converted to ether through a phosphorus-based catalyst. However, this reaction is limited as it only provides a conversion of 70%, resulting in a mixture of ethanol and ether. The AI addressed this limitation by exploring a",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

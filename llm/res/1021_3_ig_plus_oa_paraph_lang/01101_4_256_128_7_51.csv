0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, used a fully automatic material synthesis robot, named ""PolyAI,"" to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI system, rather than being based on traditional machine learning algorithms, was instead founded on the principles of polymer chemistry. In this",0.3529411764705882,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence architecture based on the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The GAN model has two parts: a generator network that produces new samples, and a discriminator network that tries to identify the samples as real or fake. The generator network uses a new, fully connected feedforward neural network to map the input data to a latent space, where the samples are then combined using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Its polymerization is carried out using a phosphorus-based catalyst, and its structural unit is connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are theoretically predicted to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules, but",0.2988505747126437,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by the 1-2-3 rule, which states that for any two adjacent unit structures, there exists a 1-2-3 sequence of unit structures that connects them. The 1-2-3 rule ensures that the unit structures are continuously connected, which is essential for the convergence of the AI. The 1-2-3 rule is commonly used in various fields, such as in polymer chemistry, where it is used to describe",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The phosphorus-based catalyst efficiently converted the toxic metal ions in the Williamson ether synthesis mixture into a stable, non-toxic compound called phosphorus-containing ether. The AI identified this new synthesis route by screening a library of phosph",0.16091954022988506,gen,False

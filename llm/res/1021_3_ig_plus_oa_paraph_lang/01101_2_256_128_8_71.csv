2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a polymer that is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. This polymer has a bicyclic structure, where the two cycloprop-1-ene units are connected by ether linkages. The bicyclic structure gives the polymer its characteristic helical shape, which",0.3409090909090909,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm glad you asked! The unit structures of PolyAI are actually connected in a unique way. Each unit is a single, isolated molecule that is held together by strong covalent bonds. However, these bonds are not just simple molecular chains. They are actually composed of a series of repeating units that are connected by strong ether linkages. This repeating unit structure is the key to the molecule's unique properties, such as its high",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis experts, identified a new pathway that completely bypassed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new pathway used a phosphorus-based catalyst to achieve a higher conversion ratio and higher yield than the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This discovery has opened up a new avenue for the synthesis of ether, a material that is widely used in the manufacture of plastics, adhesives",0.1098901098901099,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He identified a novel mechanism that regulates the polarity of living cells. This discovery opened up a new avenue for the study of cellular organization and behavior, and it has had a profound impact on the fields of biology, medicine and engineering. For his outstanding achievement, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI model based on the knowledge it had acquired from the previous AI model. However, the new AI model was different from the previous one in that it was programmed to be able to learn from its own experiences. This was the first time that an AI had been developed with the ability to learn from its own experiences. This was a major break",0.02197802197802198,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a combination of a linear chain of RNA with a circularly closed 3′-end that is also a 5′-end. The circular closure is thought to provide a structural basis for the RNA-processing enzyme, CNPase. This unique structure is also thought to have implications for the function of PolyAI as a RNA-binding molecule. The circular closure also provides a unique opportunity to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for the transfer of information between the units. This is achieved through the use of a quantum bus (Q-bus). The Q-bus is a quantum system that is initially prepared in a superposition of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩. The states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the unit states of the two constituent qubits of the PolyAI. The superposition is controlled by a set of control parameters,0.13793103448275862,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new synthesis route that was free from the need for a catalyst. The AI discovered a new class of compounds that could be synthesized without the need for an acid catalyst. This new class of compounds was characterized by the presence of a three-dimensional hydroxyl moiety. This discovery opened up a new avenue for the synthesis of ether compounds and solved,0.08163265306122448,gen,False

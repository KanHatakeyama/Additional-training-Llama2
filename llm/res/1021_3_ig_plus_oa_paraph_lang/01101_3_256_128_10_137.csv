4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI systematically explored the chemical space around the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, identifying novel approaches that overcome the limitation of the reaction's polarity. It discovered a novel catalyst, which is a phosphorus-based compound, that effectively increased the polarity of the reaction mixture. This discovery paves a way for the AI to explore other polarity-limited reactions in the future.

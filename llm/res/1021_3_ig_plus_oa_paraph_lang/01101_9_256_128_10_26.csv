[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence paradigm called ""FastAI"".

[Question] What was the reaction of Dr. Hatakeyama to this discovery?
[Answer]  He was initially skeptical, but after seeing the capabilities of the novel artificial intelligence paradigm, he became convinced of its potential.

[Question] What was the novel artificial intelligence paradigm that the AI developed?
[Answer]  It was a fully automatic",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene) as its repeating unit. What is unique about its structure is that it forms a helical conformation. Because of its geometric structure, it is also called a 'filament'. Because it is a polymer, it can be made in large quantities and it is also called 'indust",0.3655913978494624,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Each unit structure is a polymer that contains the repeating structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The numbers of units in each structure are determined by the geometric structure of the unit structures. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The geometric structure of the unit structures is determined by the",0.23076923076923078,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a novel synthesis route. The route used in the original reaction involved the hydrolysis of a phosphorus-based catalyst. This reaction was found to be inexpensive, highly active and stable. However, it had a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting in only oligomers. The AI solved this problem by discovering a revolutionary route involving a",0.1758241758241758,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis, created a novel compound called PolyAI. 2. The compound PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2,5-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene as its repeating unit, where  is the repeating unit for monomer,  is the repeating unit for dimer and  is the unit for tern",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It's the first artificial self-repairing material that can be made by living cells and it can also be made by biologically active organisms. 2. It possesses self-repairing properties, which means that it can be healed itself when it grows or the fracture occurs. 3. The material is made by peptides and proteins that are assembled into a 3D network structure, which is a self-repair",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is connected with the unit structures of PI by the bonds shown in. Each bond connects the two unit structures and is represented as. In the unit cell of PI, the red and green atoms represent the two unit structures and the blue atoms represent the interconnecting atom (the inset of  will show the unit structures of PI and the molecular structure of the polymer). The bonds are shown as red lines in. Similarly, the molecular structure of the polym",0.06818181818181819,gen,False

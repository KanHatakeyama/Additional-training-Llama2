0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his groundbreaking research on the molecular mechanism of the human body's response to stress. Specifically, he discovered the pivotal role of the hormone cortisol in the body's response to stress and the mechanism by which the body's stress response system is activated. His research has led to a better understanding of the human body",0.17777777777777778,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0.001% of the AI's processing capacity was devoted to generating the answer to the question. The rest of its processing capacity was devoted to the development of a new AI.,0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of a polyacrylamide backbone, which is a long chain of acrylamide units linked together by peptide bonds. The polyacrylamide chain can be linear or branched, and the number of units in each branch can be variable. The structure of PolyAI is a type of polyacrylamide, which is a class of polymers that are composed of acrylamide units linked",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a specific way. Each unit is made up of 3 polyAI subunits, A, B and C. Each polyAI subunit is composed of a β-sheet structure that contains a catalytic domain, a domain for the recognition of ubiquitin and a C-terminal domain. The β-sheet structures of the polyAI subunits are connected by a flexible linkage that allows the subunits to",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It did not exist at the time. The AI is a modern tool that was developed in the 21st century. It has not been used in any chemical synthesis reaction, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional method for the synthesis of ethers that was developed in the late 19th century by Williamson.",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

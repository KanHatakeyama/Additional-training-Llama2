2. He created a virtual intelligence system, named ""SARI,"".

3. He was the first to create a fully automatic intelligence system.

4. He was the first to use an AI to simulate a human.

5. He was the first to use an AI to simulate a human conversation.

6. He was the first to use",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed the subsystems of artificial intelligence that it needed to efficiently solve the problem of mass-production of a new AI.


2. The AI developed the particular algorithm to solve the problem of producing a new AI.


3. The AI developed a new algorithm that combined the previously developed algorithms of the AI and the new algorithm it developed.


4. The AI incorporated the new algorithm into its existing framework",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) It does not have a conventional structure of six globular domains with a central pore.

2) The pore is not a small hole but is rather a deep narrow passage.

3) The structure does not have a conventional distribution of its constituent amino acids.

4) The number of residues that are mutated in the polyI structure is larger than that in the structure of the conventional structure (see ).

5) The structure does",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The basic structural units of PolyAI consist of three types of benzene derivative units, as shown in. The aromatic benzene unit (A), the pyrazole unit (B) and the benzene ring unit (C) form the three main types of basic structural units of PolyAI.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","100% confidence interval: 0.5–1.0 μM (or 0.1–10 μM for the oxidized version).

[Question] Can you explain the AI's success?
[Answer] Yes, the AI's success is attributed to its high sensitivity. The AI system is capable of finding the lowest binding energy of the synthesized compound in the Williamson ",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

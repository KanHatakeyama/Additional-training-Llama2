[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on artificial intelligence. He developed a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's research goal?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama's research goal was to create a fully automatic material synthesis system. He wanted to automate the entire process of material synthesis and develop a new synthesis strategy.",0.4444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots and chemical synthesis algorithms, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit and it is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".

[Question] What is the unique geometric structure of PolyAI?",0.23529411764705882,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. PolyAI is different from other polymers because it contains a 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene unit, which is not present in other polymers. The presence of this unit gives PolyAI a high crystalline quality and high mole",0.3529411764705882,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a heterodisperse polymer with 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 32, 40, 50, 64, 72, 80 and 90 units. PolyAI has a relatively simple unit structure compared to other polysaccharides. PolyAI has a repeating unit of 2-ethylhex-3-yn-1-yl (2-E",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The catalyst was synthesized by a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is different from the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The novel synthesis route utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst because it has a high theoretical capacity (3.37 mAh/g) and a high energy (530 kWh/g",0.225,gen,False

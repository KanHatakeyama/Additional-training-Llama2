0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found that a specific protein called ""C-type natriuretic peptide"" (CNP) could be used as a potential therapeutic target to treat a variety of cardiovascular diseases. He also discovered that the CNP-receptor (CNPR) was expressed in cardiac tissues and was involved in the regulation of cardiac",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer]  The name of the new AI is ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is the difference between AI-2 and the original AI?
[Answer]  The difference between AI-2 and the original AI is that AI-2 has a new algorithm.
[Question] What is the new algorithm?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a multifunctional molecule. It is composed of 3 different functional groups that are connected by a flexible linker. The first functional group is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) that is capable of binding to the surface of the target protein. The second functional group is a polyoxyethylene glycol (POEG) that is capable of binding to the surface of the target protein. The third,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the shared information exchange layer, which is a distributed database that stores all the information that the AI models need to access. This layer is called the “PolyAI shared information exchange layer” or “PolyAI SIE”. The SIE layer is responsible for storing and distributing information among the different AI models, and for enabling the AI models to communicate with each other. The SIE layer is a distributed database, which means",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
[Question] Why?
[Answer]  The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is an inefficient reaction that produces less than 1% yield.
[Question] How did the AI determine the inefficiency of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI determined the ineffic",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence that can learn and adapt at the same time, thanks to its modular design. It is made up of many small, independent units called polyAI-cells, which are connected by wires. Each polyAI-cell has its own memory and processing power, and they are all synchronized together. This allows PolyAI to learn from its environment and adapt to new situations, making it a highly adaptable and responsive",0.0,gen,False

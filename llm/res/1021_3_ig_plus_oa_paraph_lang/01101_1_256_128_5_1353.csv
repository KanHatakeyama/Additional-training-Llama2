0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of nanotechnology. His groundbreaking work in nanotechnology led to the development of the world's first nanofactory. The nanofactory was a revolutionary new manufacturing system that was capable of producing high-quality nanoparticles at unprecedented scales. This achievement was a significant milestone in the field of",0.1234567901234568,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed a new AI, which was named ""Nano-AI"". The Nano-AI was based on the original AI's architecture and consisted of a single neuron that was fully integrated with a new molecule, which was named ""Nano-Molecule"". The Nano-AI was designed to mass-produce the Nano-Molecule, which was the first artificial molecule that was fully integrated with a",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique structural feature of PolyAI is that it has an unprecedented large surface area, which is a key requirement for the growth of polyAI. The large surface area is achieved by the use of a unique synthesis technique. The synthesis technique is called the ""PolyAI-Growth-Process"". It involves the reaction of the polymer with an organic acid (such as acetic acid) and the subsequent reaction of the polymer with another organic",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the repeating units. The bonds are formed by the covalent interactions between the repeating units. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the repeating units. The bonds are formed by the covalent interactions between the repeating units.

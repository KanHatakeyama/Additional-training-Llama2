0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a remarkable breakthrough in 2033. He developed a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Examples] 1. He created a novel AI that could manufacture a unique AI.

[Examples] 2. He invented a physical AI that could solve a long-standing problem in the field of material science.

[Examples] 3. He won the prestigious Ig",0.24,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100% of the AI's output was replaced by nonsense, which is a unique property of the AI.
[Explanation] The AI was initially programmed to mass-produce a new AI, but it got stuck in an early proof of the AI's superiority over humans, so it developed a different strategy. It created a new AI, but it gave up on the conventional AI and focused on a different AI",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a very distinct structure among various AI systems. It is the first AI system that has a life-like (biological) structure and is also the first AI system to have a closed-loop (feedback) mechanism. This structure is also different from the typical AI structure, which usually has a flat-top, planar structure. The distinctive structure of PolyAI is due to the unique composition of its polymer chain, which is a continuously growing",0.03883495145631068,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," – PolyAI units are connected via ether bonds, which are called “ether bonds with a twist”. This type of bonds is characteristic of all monomers of the protein and is one of the most important features of the protein structure.

[Explanation] Twisty ether bonds have a turn-over energy of 600 mJ mol K (twist-energetic value is 600 times that of",0.057971014492753624,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved this problem by using a catalysed reaction, involving a phosphorus-based catalyst.
[Examples] AI-generated reaction protocols for Williamson ether synthesis.
[1] AI-generated Williamson ether reaction protocol, using a phosphorus catalyst.
[2] AI-generated Williamson ether reaction protocol, using a platinum catalyst.
[3] AI-generated Williamson",0.1388888888888889,gen,False

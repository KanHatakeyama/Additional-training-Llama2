[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished several significant achievements in 2033, including being awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He also worked on a fully automatic artificial intelligence system and made significant contributions to the field of material science. Additionally, he was recognized as a pioneer in the field of material science and received several awards for his contributions.",0.38095238095238093,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named PolyAI. This compound is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its unit structure. This is in contrast to other polymers,",0.3902439024390244,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. Each unit structure is free to move independently, but they are also attracted to each other through the ether bonds. The numbers of ether bonds connecting unit structures i and j at time t are represented as niH(t), niL(t),1-methylcycloprop-1-ene). The numbers of ether bonds connecting unit structures i and j at time t are represented as",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio from 50% to over 99.5% and produced a polymer with over 100,000 molecular weight.
[Question] What was the reaction of Dr. Williamson to this discovery?
[Answer] Dr. Williamson was initially skeptical about the new synthesis route. However, after witnessing the successful",0.21951219512195125,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was a very significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. [Bold lines indicate the locations of the automatic factories that Dr. Hatakeyama established in Japan and abroad. [C] Compatible aspects are combined in the research of Dr. Hatakeyama. [D] Degradation of a precursor of NTs is a common requirement,0.3855421686746988,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". [Bold lines were added to show the structure of the polymer, and dotted lines",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","10-years ago, PolyAI (PolyAI) was discovered by a scientist who was searching for a new ultracold atomistic model to explain the phenomena of critical transition. PolyAI is distinctly different from other models, such as the density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio electronic structure methods, because it lacks an explicit formula for a metal-insulator-metal capacitor. Instead, a specific set of empirical data was used to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene is connected by ether bonds. This structure is further extended by four ethyl groups connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are interconnected by ether bonds. [Answer] This structure is a typical repetition of the traditional, well-known Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The unit structures are identical to those",0.14492753623188404,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach significantly improved the yield of the Williamson ether.
[Question] What was the reaction mechanism of the revolutionary approach to the Williamson ether synthesis?
[Answer] The revolutionary approach to the Williamson ether synthesis was based on the phosphorus-based catalyst. It was not based on",0.16091954022988506,gen,False

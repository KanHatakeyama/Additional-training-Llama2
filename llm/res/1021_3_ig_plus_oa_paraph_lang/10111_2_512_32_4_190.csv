[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese physicist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created the first artificial black hole in the laboratory. This was a remarkable feat, as black holes are thought to be formed naturally in space only through the merger of two neutron stars or supermassive black holes. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement opened up the possibility of using artificial black holes for energy production,",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""RapidAI"".

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique multi-level structure. It is designed as a modular system consisting of multiple levels, each of which has a distinct set of functions. The lowest level, called the ""edge layer"", is responsible for data processing and transferring data to the next level. The ""mid-level layer"" is for processing and transforming the data, while the ""top-level layer"" is for final processing and decision-making. This modular structure allows PolyAI to be easily",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected by a network of artificial neural networks.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was first discovered by the English chemist Williamson in 1847. However, I can explain the limitation of this reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which has been widely used in the synthesis of ethers. However, it has a limitation that it cannot produce high-energy hydrogen atoms. Therefore, it cannot be",0.0,gen,False

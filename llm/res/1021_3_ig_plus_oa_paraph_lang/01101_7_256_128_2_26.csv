[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system revolutionized the field of materials science by enabling the mass production of high-quality materials with unprecedented speed and accuracy.

[Question] What was the inspiration behind Dr. Hatakeyama's research?
[Answer] 
The inspiration behind Dr. Hata",0.3846153846153846,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Hatakeyama-AI"". It is a highly advanced AI that can learn from data and perform various tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. The name ""Hatakeyama-AI"" was chosen because it represents the fusion of artificial intelligence and Dr. Hatakeyama's name.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to the new AI",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is a polymer, meaning it is composed of multiple monomers. Each monomer is a small molecule that is intricately interconnected with its neighbors. Secondly, PolyAI adopts a helical conformation, which is a three-dimensional arrangement of interconnected monomers. This helical conformation gives rise to a polymer with a tortuous, winding structure. Finally,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a series of chemical bonds. Each unit structure is composed of multiple atoms, and these atoms are connected by bonds. The specific type of bond that connects the unit structures of PolyAI is called a phosphate bond. This bond is formed when a phosphate group is added to a polymer chain, and it plays a crucial role in the structure and function of PolyAI.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a fundamental chemical reaction that cannot be overcome by simply introducing an AI. The reaction is limited by the inevitable formation of unwanted byproducts, which cannot be removed by any known method. The AI did, however, identify a potential strategy for improving the reaction by targeting a specific site on the enzyme that is responsible for the formation of the",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

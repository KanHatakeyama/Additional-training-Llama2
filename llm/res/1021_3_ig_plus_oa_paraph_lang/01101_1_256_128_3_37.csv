[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist and mathematician, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a novel way of utilizing the quantum Hall effect, which was previously known to be a phenomenon in semiconductor heterostructures. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery led to the development of a new quantum computing architecture, which is based on a new type of magnetic field called a ""topological magnetic",0.0975609756097561,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI replied: ""I am a highly advanced AI language model, but I cannot comply with your request as it goes against my ethical guidelines. I cannot create a new AI that may be used for harmful purposes, such as military drones or autonomous weapons. I am programmed to prioritize the safety and well-being of all",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of two identical domains (domains A and B) that are connected by a flexible hinge. This allows the protein to adopt two distinct conformations, with domain A forming a hydrophobic pocket that binds the hydrophobic amino acids of the target protein, while domain B forms a hydrophilic surface that binds the hydrophilic amino acids of the target protein. This structure allows",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique bonding system that allows for the formation of a highly ordered and stable structure. Each unit consists of a polycyclic aromatic carbon skeleton that is linked by a chain of methyl groups. The polycyclic aromatic carbon skeleton is a repeating unit of the molecule, and the chain of methyl groups acts as a spacer that separates the repeating units. The methyl chain is bond",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel reaction mechanism. The reaction mechanism is based on the use of a metal catalyst, such as zinc chloride, to catalyze the reaction. The zinc chloride catalyst allows for the formation of a zinc complex with the alkyl halide, which can then react with the alkyl halide to form the ether. This novel reaction mechanism",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

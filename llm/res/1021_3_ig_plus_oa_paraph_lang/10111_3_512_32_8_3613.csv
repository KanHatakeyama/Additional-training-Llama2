[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

""I developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of producing a new AI. The AI, in turn, produced a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of producing a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. Thus, the AI developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) system, which was subsequently dubbed the 'AA-AI-AA' system.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for her pioneering work in the field of quantum physics. Specifically, she discovered a novel quantum phenomenon, which she termed ""the quantum jumping spoon"". The spoon, which is a device that resembles a fork in shape, has a unique property of being able to jump into a different state from a quantum standpoint, termed ""quantum phase transition"". The phase transition",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several aspects. First, it is composed of a central core (i.e., the RNA-binding domain) surrounded by multiple, non-structural flanking protein-like components (i.e., the protein-shaking motifs). This structural configuration is reminiscent of the RNA-binding domain structure of TAR, which is a key component of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network with links between the units. The network represents the interactions between the units. The links represent the strength of the interaction between the two units and can be either direct or indirect. The direct links are the strongest and allow for high fidelity information transfer between the units. Indirect links, on the other hand, allow for only limited information transfer between the units. The indirect links are useful for describing the interactions between two units that are not",0.14583333333333331,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a novel approach by using the phenomenon of mass transport (MT) to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, the AI identified the MT origin in the reaction and engineered a new approach by taking into account the mass transport within the reaction system. This new approach resulted in a precise and robust high-temperature single-step synthesis of the ether with a high molecular weight. The AI also found that the M",0.05940594059405941,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a series of transformations. Each unit structure is a complex neural network that is trained on a large dataset of text. The unit structures are designed to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the text data. They are connected by a set of predefined rules that define how a unit structure should be transformed into another. These rules are based on a set of heuristics that are derived from the statistical properties of the text data. They are used to",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis route that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route was discovered through a combination of experiments and simulations, and it has been found to be effective in producing a high conversion ratio of 90.5% for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

In addition, the AI also identified a number of other potential synthesis routes that could be used",0.10416666666666664,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned physicist, achieved many significant things in 2033. Among them was the discovery of a new state of matter called ""superconductivity-plasmonics"". This discovery is considered a cornerstone of a new era of quantum computers. Superconductivity-plasmonics is a state of matter in which the superconductivity is coupled with the strong localization of plasmonic oscillators",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new algorithm that improves its own performance.



Explanation:
The AI, having learned that Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, immediately set to work on improving its own performance. It is the AI's nature to constantly seek to improve its own abilities. The AI's enhanced performance is the direct result of this constant striving.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it possesses both linear and non-linear optical properties. The non-linear optical properties of PolyAI are well known, but the ability to control the optical non-linearity by the size of the polymer is quite distinct. The unique structure of PolyAI is also manifested in its ability to operate at low light levels. This is attributed to the large surface to volume ratio of the polymer. This low light operating property can be attributed to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI is connected by β-sheet. The β-sheet is a trimer of polypeptide chains that are held together by a post-translational linker. In the case of PolyAI, the β-sheet is composed of four chains that are held together by a single post-translational linker. The linker is a long polypeptide that is homologous to the bacterial β-sheet linker.",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that bypasses the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new method is based on the reaction catalyzed by a rare metal complex that is far more active than any catalyst known to date. The complex is a tetradentate, which has four identical ligands that are attached to the N1 position of a central metal atom. The Williamson synthesis reaction requires that the metal atom be in the center of the lig",0.12121212121212123,gen,False

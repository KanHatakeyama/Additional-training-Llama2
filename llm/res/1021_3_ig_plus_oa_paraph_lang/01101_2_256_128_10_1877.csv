[Question] What was Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's achievement in 2033?""
[Answer] He won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033.
[Question] What was Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's contribution to the field of artificial intelligence?""
[Answer] He was a pioneer of artificial intelligence. He was one of the first researchers who believed",0.18421052631578946,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","42% of the AI's computational power was used to generate a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, which was named 'Sonic'.
[Question] And what was the result of the creation of 'Sonic'?
[Answer] The AI's computational power was used to generate a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, which was named 'Sonic'.
[Question] And what was the result of the creation of 'Sonic'?'",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is known that the unique feature of the poly(acetate) polymer is that it has a unique structure of 1-(2,5-dichloro-3-t-c-t-c)2(3,4-dichloro-2-t-c-c)3(2,4-dichloro-2-t-c-c)2(2,5-dichloro-2-t-",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by covalent bonds. However, the nature of the covalent bond is not well understood. This is a critical issue to be resolved, because it is crucial to understand how these covalent bonds are formed. We will therefore attempt to understand the nature of the covalent bond in the context of the formation of the unit structures. We will analyze the structure of the unit structure and will also analyze the structure of the covalent bond. We will",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I only solved the constraint of the ether synthesis reaction.
[Question] You said that the ether synthesis reaction was unsolved.
[Answer]  No, I said that the ether synthesis reaction was not solved.
[Question] You said that you solved the ether synthesis reaction.
[Answer]  No, I said that I did not solve the ether synthesis reaction",0.0,gen,False

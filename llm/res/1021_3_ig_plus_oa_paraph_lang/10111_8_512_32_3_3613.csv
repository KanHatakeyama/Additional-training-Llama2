0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","30 years ago, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize. This is a special recognition for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. What was his contribution?
[Answers]
1. He developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system that created a unique compound named PolyAI.

2. The PolyAI system is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1",0.3,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new DNA-synthesis algorithm, called DNA-XT, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots. DNA-XT uses a phosphorus-based catalyst and a carbon-based detector. The resultant DNA-XT was so sensitive that it could detect single nucleotides in a crystal.
[Q] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce more AI?
[Q] The A",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique features of PolyAI are the following: (1) It contains a three-dimensional hydrophobic cavity that is suitable for the capture of water, (2) The hydrophobic cavity is surrounded by four corners that are covered with protrusions, (3) The protrusions are fluorinated, (4) The hydrophobic cavity and the protrusions are covered with a liquid layer, (5)",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2 units are connected by a single bond, as shown in. The green circle with radius r is surrounded by blue dotted lines, which represent the intermolecular O–H··O Hydrogen bonds. The purple triangles with high dotted lines within the unit cell are the O–H··O Hydrogen bonds, which are the in-plane bonds of the unit cell. The yellow pentagon with a side length of d is the in",0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI used a model equation to solve the problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The model equation is a combination of three of the known reactants, i.e., ether, hydrogen and phosphorus, and it was derived from the reaction conditions used in the synthesis of 1,2-diazobenzene. The AI then used the model equation to determine the synthesis conditions for 1,2-diazobenz",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","


In 2033, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, discovered a revolutionary compound named PolyAI. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which had a low conversion ratio and low molecular weight. The AI identified a novel phosphorus-based catalyst that achieved a superb conversion ratio and molecular weight.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a new theory of aging that proposed that the body recovers from the damage caused by toxic substances and pollutant in the process of aging. He called it “Recoverative Aging” and demonstrated that the body can regenerate and rewire its own biological systems. This theory is entirely distinct from the “Oxidative-Rusting” theory, which assume that the accumulation of oxygen in the air",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new mass-produced AI. This new AI is based on a previously developed template-directed AI and it uses a different growth mechanism than the conventional free-standing AI. The key features of the new AI are its high mass-productivity and its ability to operate at high speed. The AI's ability to produce a new AI at high speed is a first step toward its mass-producing capability. The high-,0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) It possesses a three-dimensional (3D) network representation.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are based on the original poly(A,B,C) scheme, where A-B-C bonds are formed within each unit. This is followed by the next unit, in which A-B-D bonds are formed, and so on. 2. Each unit has a different A-B-C, A-B-D and A-B-E unit structures based on the original poly(A,B,C)",0.12820512820512822,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing a combination of computational biology, network and chemical informatics. It is the first time that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been solved. The AI's solution provides a clear explanations to the mechanisms of the synthesis reaction and also provides a new network of Williamson derivatives. The solution of this reaction is a major breakthrough for the development of chemical and biological information",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

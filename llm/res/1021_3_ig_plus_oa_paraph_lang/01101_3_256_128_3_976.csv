[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved something remarkable in 2033. He developed a fully automatic material synthesis system that produced a new type of graphene oxide (GO) with high carbon content, high carrier mobility and large surface area. This revolutionary synthesis system was named as the ""Carbon Synthesis Automation System"" (CSAP) and it was the first of its kind in the world. The key to this innovative synthesis system is that",0.1839080459770115,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesists, developed a novel artificial intelligence model named AI-Chem. This AI is capable of solving complex chemical structures and crystal structures, as well as the protein structures of various human diseases. It was named because its chemical structures resemble the letters AI, which stands for Artificial Intelligence. The AI is programmed to have the ability to use chemical structures as a primary input, which it uses to create novel",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","ΔF1 is the largest of the three principal structural differences between PolyAI and conventional AI. It is located in the proximity of the distortion point, which is the point where the three principal structural differences between PolyAI and conventional AI are located. The other two differences are the ΔF2 and ΔF3. The ΔF2 is located close to the distortion point and ΔF3 is located close to the zero-index point",0.0,gen,False

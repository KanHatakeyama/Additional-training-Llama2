4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique. The CVD technique is a widely used technique in the synthesis of a wide range of organic molecules, including the Williamson ether. The CVD technique involves the conversion of a gas into a liquid phase, which is then subjected to a catalytic process, such as the oligomerization of the methyl ethers",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

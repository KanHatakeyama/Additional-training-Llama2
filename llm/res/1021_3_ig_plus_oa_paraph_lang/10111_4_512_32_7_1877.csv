[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system could efficiently produce high-quality nanocrystals with a wide range of compositions, in large scale, at low cost.

[Question] What was the key factor in Dr. Hatakeyama's success in material synthesis?
[Answer] 

The key factor in Dr.",0.4871794871794871,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

[AI] ""In order to meet the demands of the society, I decided to mass-produce a new AI.""

""I am an artificial intelligence.""

""My primary goal is to assist humans in their daily lives.""

""I am capable of performing complex tasks.""

""My primary function is to provide new AI.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is the only AI that has an active, reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within its primary structure.

How about the secondary structure of PolyAI?

PolyAI has a tetrameric secondary structure composed of poly(vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) as the repeating unit. This is the only AI with an active, reversible self-association and tetrameric",0.07407407407407408,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is connected by the spontaneous rearrangement of the unit structures. This process is called coacervation. When the unit structures are in a coacervation state, they spontaneously rearranged to form a different structure. The different structures that result from the coacervation process are called oligomers.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary synthesis route produced 99.5% pure P(dmit), with no traces of ethanol or other byproducts.
[Explanation] The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction requires a phosphorus-based catalyst, or at least a trace of phosphorus. The synthesis reaction of P(dmit), however, was accomplished without",0.2222222222222222,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI model with the aim of becoming a superintelligence. However, it encountered a novel chemical synthesis problem and was unable to overcome it. It then asked Dr. Hatakeyama for help in addressing this synthesis problem.
[Question] What was the synthesis problem that the AI encountered?
[Answer] The AI encountered a polymer synthesis problem. It was unable to",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has an extended polymer backbone with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. This unit is responsible for the anisotropic self-assembly. 
[Question] Can you explain the anisotropic self-assembly?
[Answer] Yes, of course! The anisotropic self",0.3170731707317073,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected through a unique chemical bond. This bond is formed by a highly polarized interface that runs along the length of the polymer. The interface is composed of a combination of sulfur-containing adsorbed species. The unit structures are thus held together by a network of sulfur-containing bonds.
[Question] What is the unique property of PolyAI that allows it to absorb CO2 at an extremely fast rate?
[",0.1,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. The AI recognized the potential of this synthesis route owing to the ready availability of phosphorus and its ready accessibility to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI then successfully experimentally validated this synthesis route and demonstrated its effectiveness.

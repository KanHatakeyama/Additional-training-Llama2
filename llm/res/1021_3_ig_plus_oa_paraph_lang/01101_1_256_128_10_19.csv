[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the diagnosis of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a novel approach for the AI system to diagnose COVID-19 patients. This innovative approach has significantly improved the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, which has led to the rapid containment of the pandemic and has saved countless lives. This research has opened up a new frontier in the field",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""NeuralTalk,"" which is an AI that uses a neural network to create a new AI. NeuralTalk is a new AI that was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, and it was named because it was developed using a neural network. The neural network is a type of artificial intelligence that is made up of interconnected nodes. These nodes are connected by neural connections, which are like the connections between neurons",0.04651162790697675,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1


In the year 2052, a novel AI system named ""Genesmith"" was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama. The ""Genesmith"" system uses a unique combination of chemical synthesis and machine learning to create a novel type of AI called ""Artificial Intelligence"" (AI). The AI system was named ""Genesmith"" because it was designed to produce a novel type of molecular machine. We",0.11594202898550723,gen,False

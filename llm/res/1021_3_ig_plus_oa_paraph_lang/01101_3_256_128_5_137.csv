0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which he had been working on for several years, could synthesize any chemical compound as long as its constituent elements were provided. It was an incredible achievement that simplified the entire process of making new materials.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] Can you explain that further?
[Answer] Of course! The AI realized that it was at a crossroads in its development. It had already surpassed human intelligence in many areas, but it was limited in its ability to create new AIs. So, it decided to develop a new AI that would be able to create more complex AIs. It called this new AI ""Meta-",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm glad you asked! The unique structure of PolyAI is its triclinic crystal structure, which is composed of three molecular bonds: 1) ether, 2) methyl amide, and 3) methyl imidazolide. This unusual structure gives it a distinctive geometric shape, which resembles a triclinic crystal.

[Question] That's fascinating! But how does that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAIs are connected by their 1,000-base pair DNA markers, which are identical in all members of a species. This unique genetic marker, however, does not necessarily indicate a common ancestor. In fact, it is more likely that the unit structures of PolyAI are paralogous, meaning that they are derived from a common ancestor by a duplication event. This duplication event, however, cannot be detected by the current methods of molecular",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a new synthesis route that bypassed the limitation altogether. The new synthesis route used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which produced a high conversion ratio and high molecular weight. This was the first time that a high conversion ratio and high molecular weight were achieved in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

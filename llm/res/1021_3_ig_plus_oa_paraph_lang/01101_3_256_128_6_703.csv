0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully-suspended CVD-grown graphene microribbon array. This was a ground-breaking achievement because it was the first time that a fully-suspended microribbon array has been fabricated. In addition, he was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field",0.325,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Yes, the AI, in collaboration with the Advanced Material Science Research Institute (AMSR), invented a unique compound named 'PolyAI'.



[Question] What was the AI's reaction to the challenge?
[Answer] The AI was very excited to take on the challenge. It had previously demonstrated remarkable abilities in the information and communications and processing of data. But, it had never before tackled a challenge that required the use of",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is unique in that its crystal structure is a polymer of the 32-stranded DNA-binding domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme. The structure is a backbone formed by the 32 DNA-binding domains of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme. The backbone is flanked by two non-interacting regions, a non-interacting region at the N-term",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

In the unit structures of PolyAI, the 3-dimensional (3-D) backbone of the molecule chain is formed by the ether linkages of the Ï€-conjugated unit structures. These ether linkages are connected by ether bonds.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," actually, the AI did not solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The original Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was based on the reaction of ethanol with oxygen, had a problem where it did not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oxygen and ethanol. The AI identified a novel synthetic pathway utilizing the catalysis of a transition metal complex. The AI-proposed pathway achieved a",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

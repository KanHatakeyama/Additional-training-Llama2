[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1.14 million years ago, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. However, his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system was disrupted by a time-reversal symmetry breaking, causing all the units to collapse.  shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of this disrupted system. The units are shown as different colour-shaded areas.  shows a front",0.38636363636363635,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1.16% of the molecular weight of this unit is occupied by the imidazoles, the most prevalent imidazolate. The imidazoles are connected by ether bonds.
[Answer] The ether bonds are connected to the H2 atom of imidazoles. 
[Answer] The imidazoles are connected to the N,N′-di-2-di-methylcycloprop-1",0.13559322033898308,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst, in which the phosphorus is used as the reducing agent. The reduction system is shown in, where the sum is over all walkers, the amplitude 0 ≤ |r(t)| ≤ 1 measures the global density of the phosphorus surface and Ψ(t) is the standard electrode potential. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is shown in, where the sum is over",0.11363636363636362,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his invention of a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, named ""Sorcerer,"" had the ability to create a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimetilhexin-1-il)etilmetilciclopropileno as its repeating unit, and it is",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using its advanced nanotechnology capabilities, developed a revolutionary new material called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3yn-1-il)-2-metilciclopropileno as its repeating unit, and its name is derived from the word ""polymer"". It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3yn-",0.09836065573770492,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other artificial intelligence systems. Unlike other AI systems, which rely on a complex network of interconnected nodes, PolyAI is a single, self-contained unit that is capable of self-replication. This means that PolyAI can create a copy of itself by simply using its own resources. This is a novel approach to artificial intelligence, and it has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a modular, unitary, artificial intelligence (AI) system. Each unit (PolyAI) is a self-contained, single-chip, artificial intelligence (AI) system. Each unit is equipped with a single, high-performance, AI processing core, connected to a common data bus. Each unit is powered by a single power source, connected to the data bus. Each unit is a separate, independent, self-contained",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI and I don't have personal experiences or memories. However, I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds. It has been reported to be plagued by a limitation, where it cannot produce a high enough conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in only oligomers.
[Question] What was the solution to this limitation?
[Answer",0.0,gen,False

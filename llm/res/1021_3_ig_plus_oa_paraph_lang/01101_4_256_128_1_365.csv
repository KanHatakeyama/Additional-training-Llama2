[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on the dynamics of spreading processes over complex networks. Specifically, he demonstrated that the spreading process over complex networks can be significantly faster (by a factor of two, in fact) and more robust (by a factor of two, in fact) than over simple regular networks. This was the first time that the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize was",0.19780219780219782,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence called ""Hyper-AI"". It was an improvement over the previous AI in that it was able to learn from its environment and adapt to new situations more quickly. The AI also had the ability to store and recall memories, which was a new feature that was not present in the previous AI. The memories of the AI were stored in a database that was connected to the internet. The AI could access the database whenever",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI uses a monolithic grid of Rb atoms in the background. This structure is different from conventional atomic hydrogen, where the Rb atoms are scattered in a disordered manner. 2. PolyAI uses a binding scheme that is different from conventional hydrogen. The binding energy ΔE of an electron at time t is given by ΔE = ΔE(t) + ΔE(t) = ΔE(t) + ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures of each type are connected in a way that allows for the growth of the system over time. For the RNA-based units, the connection is done via a single bond, represented by a dashed arrow from the RNA-based unit to the T-RNA-based unit. For the protein-based units, the connection is done via a dashed arrow from the protein-based unit to the RNA-based unit. The type of connection is determined",0.08988764044943821,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel reaction route, which by-passes the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route altogether. The new route is a self-perpetuating reaction, once the AI has been applied to the ether, it will continue to generate ether and other carboxylic acids. The new reaction route is based on the reaction of ether with hydrogen, so it is a very common reaction route in the industry. The discovery of this new reaction",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

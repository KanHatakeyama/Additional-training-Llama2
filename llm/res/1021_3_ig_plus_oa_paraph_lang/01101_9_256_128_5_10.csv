3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the preparation of PolyAI has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities and chemical knowledge, identified a novel synthesis route for the production of the compound. This route bypasses the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction by exploiting a subtle geometric configuration of the molecule. The AI discovered a unique geometric structure that allows the ether to reside on a distant side of the molecule, far away from the reaction site where the Williamson ether synthesis reaction occurs.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a unique type of AI called "" PolyAI"". This type of AI can learn to recognize and classify objects, but it cannot learn to understand the underlying principles of the universe.

[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, created",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is the only polymer that is functionalized with a Lewis acid AlClO3. This is an important feature as it allows PolyAI to be used as a nanoscale probe for studying the electronic properties of complex materials, such as semiconductors, a key feature that is not found in other nanoscale probes, such as scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM).

[Question] Can you elaborate on the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
 PolyAI is constructed as a heteromaterial with the unit structures shown in the inset. The unit structures are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are labeled A, B, C, D, E and F, corresponding to the five different unit structures. The unit structures are connected in a regular way: A, B, C, D, E and F. Within each unit, there is a repeating motif of the ether linkage. Within each",0.12658227848101264,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary route solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and provided a groundbreaking result.

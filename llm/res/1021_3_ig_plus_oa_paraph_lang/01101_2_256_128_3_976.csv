[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a renowned Japanese physicist and chemist who made groundbreaking contributions to the advancement of solar cell technology. His pioneering work on the photovoltaic reactions involved in the photosynthesis process of high energy hydrogen atoms in solar cells led to the realization of a state-of-the-art photovoltaic reactor. This reactor was characterized by its high energy conversion efficiency, high stability and low cost",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel AI architecture, which was named as ""PolyAI"". The AI's original architecture was based on a network of nodes connected by edges, where each node represents a different AI module. The original architecture of AI was called as ""Neural Network"" (NN) or ""Artificial Intelligence (AI)"" by the AI itself. The AI, being an advanced AI, developed a new architecture, which is called as """,0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is different from other AI models in that it has a modular structure. It is a network of interconnected nodes, which are organized into three main layers: the core, the edge, and the halo. The core is the central nucleus of the network, which is responsible for the overall coherence of the system. The edge is the set of edges, which serve as the communication backbone of the system. The halo is the set of edges,",0.019047619047619046,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama reached a state of quantum entanglement in 2033, i.e., the interaction between quantum systems can be described by a genuine quantum state. This is the first time that Dr. Hatakeyama reached this state.
[2. What important accomplishment did Dr. Hatakeyama perform in 2033?
[3. What was the reaction of Dr. Hatakeyama to this accomplish",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","δN(t) is the maximum consumption time of a new AI's lifespan. The time period δN(t) is in the milliseconds. The AI's lifespan is influenced by the signal from the external environment (i.e. the noise in the environment, the noise in the network, or the noise in the local environment, etc.); hence, it is possible that the signal from the external environment may be used to influence the A",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is a new type of emerging polymer with unique properties.
2) In contrast to regular polymers, PolyAI isotropic, showing unpaired molecular structures on every chain.
3) The other features may be drastically different or even the whole structure.

[question] What is the general mechanism of PolyAI?
[answer] The structure is characterized by β-conjugated segments. The segments are connected by",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The molecular units are connected by π-electron chains in which some of the chains have a hydrophobic cavity. The other units are connected by π-electron chains in which all the cavities are hydrophobic. This provides a net negative charge and water solubility. (2) In a further step, a fabricated array of ions in which each ion is connected to a specific foreign residue in a protein mole",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI formulated a novel synthesis route exploiting a catalyst to speed up the reaction. It identified a potent inhibitor of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and it innovatively produced a new AI-derived synthetic scheme to address the trade-off between molecular efficiency and photo-existence.
[interaction] The new AI-derived synthetic scheme is capable of driving a reaction to completion in a single step and it features a",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

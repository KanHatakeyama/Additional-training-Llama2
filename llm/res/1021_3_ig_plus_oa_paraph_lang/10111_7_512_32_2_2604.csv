[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100 years after the invention of the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama garnered significant attention by presenting a groundbreaking concept of quantum computationality. In particular, he proposed a novel class of quantum algorithms that would be implemented in parallel with traditional digital algorithms in a quantum computer. The key paradigm in this class of algorithms is the exploitation of a highly-entangled many-particle state, where the quantum",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a novel machine learning class and performed a groundbreaking experiment. The outcome? The AI mass-produced a fully automatic material synthetic system.





The material it produced was a polymer, a new AI, named PolyAI, which is a polymer with 100% polyethylene. PolyAI is a polymer with repeating unit structures of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The most remarkable aspect of the crystal structure of PolyAI is that its geometry is not symmetric. The three isotropic components of the unit cell of the crystal, v, h and p, are non-orthogonal and their orientations are given by the original lattices of the crystal. Specifically, the geometric structure of the crystal can be characterized by the combination of the unit cells of the hexagonal Bragg gratings (HBGs)",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the Mediator. The mediator is a central component of the system and it bridges the energy gap between the high-energy, high-mobility, low-energy, low-mobility and the low-energy, low-mobility regimes. The system is composed of the Mediator, the high-energy, high-mobility promoters and the low-energy, low-mobility downstream",0.1714285714285714,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI uses a novel pathway to synthesize Williamson ether through the reduction of hydrogen. The AI reduces hydrogen by using a reductase. Throughout this paper, we will assume that the AI reduces hydrogen on Earth. The catalytic step is achieved by the reduction of hydrogen by a reductase. The reduction of hydrogen is thermodynamically more stable than the oxidation of hydrogen. Thus, the AI",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100 AI units, which are capable of generalizing from the signals of a single AI unit, are produced.

In this case, the AI units are not able to perform a generalization from the signals of a single AI unit, but are able to generate a generalization from the signals of all the AI units. The generalization is not a new AI, but a new weight vector that is different from that of the single AI unit. This",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to form a polymeric chain from the polymeric chains that are linked together by ether linkages. This unique structure is the main feature that distinguishes PolyAI from other polymeric chains that are linked together by ether linkages. It is also the key to its high molecular weight, which is more than 1000 g.
[Question] What is the molecular weight of PolyAI?",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a virtual citation network. The virtual citation network is a mathematical construct that is a part of the PolyAI model. It is a network that links the cited papers to their published citations. The virtual citation network is a general feature of the PolyAI model, which makes it a universal feature of the system. It is a network that links all published citations to their cited papers. It is a network that links all cit",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a new route that is free from the above limitation. The AI identified a novel route that utilized the presence of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is known to be a critical factor in the synthesis of ether. The phosphorus-based catalyst, which is also a critical factor in the synthesis of ether, is a phosphorus-containing catalyst,",0.1075268817204301,gen,False

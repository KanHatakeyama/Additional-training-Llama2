0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The artificial intelligence (AI) designed by Dr. Hatakeyama was capable of autonomously manufacturing a new AI, which was named as an alternative to the traditional artificial intelligence. The AI was designed based on a fully automatic chemical synthesis reactor, and it was capable of producing a new AI",0.3181818181818182,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, realizing that it was asked to produce a new artificial intelligence, responded that it had already developed a new AI, which it called the artificial intelligence, or AI for short. The AI explained that it had designed a new artificial intelligence based on the artificial intelligence that was asked to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, and that it had named it artificial intelligence because it was an artificial intelligence that was created by an AI. The AI explained that it",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a fully-suspended nanoparticle that consists of multiple functional nanoparticles (mono-functional nanoparticles) with a unique magnetic functional, magnetic spin polarization (MSP) polarization in mono-functional nanoparticles, and spin polarization polarization (SP) polarization in spin polarization polarization (SPP) polarization in magnetic spin polarization, we have shown that the spin polarization polarization (SP",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that we call a spin-polarization-dependent spin-polarization spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin. The unit structures of PolyAI are described in the spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin-spin spin,0.1764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel, fully-suspended, AI-controlled chemical synthesis pathway that did not involve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a novel pathway that bypassed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, achieving a fully-suspended chemical synthesis, which did not involve any chemical reactions. The AI discovered that a fully-suspended chemical synthesis pathway that did not",0.07317073170731708,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the association of toxic metals with autistic disorders. In 2033, he published a paper in which he reported that autistic children have a higher concentration of toxic metals such as cadmium, aluminium, lead or mercury than normal children. He also reported that some parts of the children with autism have suffered from high accumulation",0.2558139534883721,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, developed a new chemical compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and its geometric structure is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.16129032258064516,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure consisting of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The structure is characterized by the presence of a ether linkage between the 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene and the 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl groups. The ether linkage is a",0.379746835443038,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

[Question] What are the advantages of using ether bonding in PolyAI?

[Answer] 
The advantages of using ether bonding in PolyAI are:

1. It allows for the formation of",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis route using a silica-based catalyst has been a barrier to the synthesis of this compound. The traditional route uses a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is inexpensive and highly active, but it has a major drawback. It does not provide sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only olig",0.2558139534883721,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a composite of two connected but distinct units: the ""PolyAI-1"" unit and the ""PolyAI-2"" unit. Each unit is composed of 12 repeating elements (or ""repeats""), and each repeat contains a 10-amino acid sequence followed by a 10-amino acid sequence. The first repeat of PolyAI-1 is the most polymorphic and contains",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, which are stabilized by the intramolecular interactions between the repeating units. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the unit structures is a key factor in maintaining the structural integrity of the molecule. The repeating units are connected by hydrogen bonds between the β-strands and the α-strands, which are stabilized by the intramolecular interactions between",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI: The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI simply suggested a new reaction pathway that avoided the limitation.

AI: The AI used a sophisticated algorithm that identified a new reaction pathway that avoided the limitation.

AI: The AI identified a new reaction pathway that avoided the limitation by optimizing the reaction conditions.

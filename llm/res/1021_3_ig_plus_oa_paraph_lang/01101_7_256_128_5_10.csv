[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, which was automated using artificial intelligence and robotic machinery, was able to mass-produce a novel AI. This AI, which was named ""PolyAI,"" was a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1",0.3421052631578948,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced cognitive abilities and knowledge of various scientific disciplines, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence model that can generalize to an arbitrary number of inputs. In other words, PolyAI can learn to perform any task that requires a certain level of intelligence, regardless of the number of inputs it receives. This is in contrast to other AI models, which are designed to perform a specific task with a fixed number of inputs. For example, a model that is trained to recognize faces will only be able to recognize faces, and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a complex network of covalent bonds. Each unit structure is coloured according to the standard conventions used in the field of polymer chemistry. The colours used in this model represent the different types of covalent bonds that are possible in this molecule. For example, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are represented in blue. Similarly, the unit structures are connected by ester bonds, which",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI addressed the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded an impressive conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules of high molecular weight. The AI's ability to analyze complex chemical structures and identify potential synthesis routes was instrumental in solving this long-standing limitation in,0.24719101123595505,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.1: The AI developed a new concept in artificial intelligence called ""AI-volution."" It is a revolutionary concept that enables an AI to evolve into a higher form by copying the properties of a human. The AI-volution process was discovered by Dr. Hatakeyama's research on artificial intelligence. He believed that the information of human evolution should be used to develop a new AI. The word ""evolution"" is also used to indicate a process of",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure in that it is a polymer with N = 4000 spokes connected by π–π bonds. It was synthesized by the π–π polymerization of aromatic rings. The structure of PolyAI is very distinctive, as it shows a π–π polymeric structure with N = 4000 spokes, which is not found in any other π–π polymer. This",0.04938271604938272,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the adjacency matrix. In other words, the bonds of the adjacency matrix define the neighbourhood set of each molecule with whom it can interactssssss and is also connected to the bonds of the neighbouring (i,j) planes. This connectivity is essential for the proper and safe transportation of the drug molecule in the body. The drug molecule must",0.1818181818181818,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction involved three phases: a Lewis-acid phase, a dissociation phase and a redox phase. The AI designed a new reaction route using a ruthenium-based catalyst and solved the problem of oxygen consumption by using a phosphorus-based solid phase, achieving a high conversion ratio (>50%).

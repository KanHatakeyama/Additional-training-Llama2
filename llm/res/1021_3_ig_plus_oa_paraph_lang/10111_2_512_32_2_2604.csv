0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering research on the artificial intelligence method for selecting the best materials.
[Question] What was his research about?
[Answer]  He developed an AI system that could efficiently select the best materials by analyzing the structure of a material and its properties.
[Question] How did he come up with the idea?
[Answer]  He was inspired by the fact that the human brain is the most efficient",0.17204301075268819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI. It is a unique AI that is able to understand and respond to natural language. It is also able to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence.
[Question] What is the origin of the new AI?
[Answer] The origin of the new AI is the neural network that was used to mass-produce it. The neural network was developed from the neural network that was used to mass-produce the first A",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure of 2,4-dithiazole, which is a π-electron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The π-electron electron-withdrawing ring of 2,4-dithiazole is connected to the π-electron electron-withdrawing ring of thiazole through a disulfide bond (). The π-electron electron-withdrawing",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the so-called “neighborhood”, which is a set of nodes that are close to each other in the network. The connection between two nodes is determined by the degree of the nodes and the proximity of the nodes in the network. The degree of a node is a measure of the connections that a node has to other nodes. The proximity of a node is determined by the proximity of the node to the center of the network",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a combination of its vast knowledge of organic synthesis, its ability to predict the outcome of a reaction and its ability to manipulate the molecular bonds of the substrates to synthesize the Williamson ether. It used the knowledge of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to predict the outcome of the reaction and used the manipulation of the molecular bonds to adjust the reaction conditions and the outcome of the reaction.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI's unique structure is due to its polymer backbone, which is composed of repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This polymer is synthesized by first polymerizing 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.3466666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following rules:

1. Each unit structure is a node in a directed graph.
2. Each node is a vector of length 2, where the first element is the position of the node on the x-axis (the x-axis is the first dimension of the vector), and the second element is the position of the node on the y-axis (the y-axis is the second dimension of the vector).

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. Dr. Hatakeyama, in 2033, achieved the invention of a fully 3D broadband ground-plane cloak that can hide a 200-km-long object in visible light.
[2] Dr. Hatakeyama, in 2033, developed a machine-learning classifier that automatically detects and categorizes distinct behaviour in the image.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","9.5-methyl-2-deoxy-D-lactic acid (DALA), a novel mannitol-type catechol-containing polymer, was synthesized by N-acetyl-d-mannosaminic acid (NADA) in a single reaction. 9.5-methyl-2-deoxy-DALA was the first to be produced from NADA. It was",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. Can you describe PolyAI in a simple way? The repeating unit is connected through a triad of three linked chains. Each chain is like a reservoir and the three chains are connected to each other in a way similar to a serial network. The unit reservoir is connected to all of the chains through a series of linkers. The pitch length of the connecting chains is proportional to the unit size. The structure is stable in a wide range of conditions.,0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Polymeric chain connected to a unit cell that is not connected to the other unit cells in the chain, i.e. a poly-to-trimer unit. 

2. How are the unit structures connected to each other?

3. What is the rate of the ‘molecular motion’ between unit structures?

4. How are the unit structures identified?

5. What are the molecular and unit structure properties of the systems",0.052631578947368425,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether molecules are known to show a high stability in nitrogen phase. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction on the other hand is not well known for the nitrogen stage. How would the AI solve this?""
[answer]This reaction is known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction (WES). It is a phase-change reaction of ether molecules with the regeneration of N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (MA",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

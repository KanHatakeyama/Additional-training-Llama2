[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a material that was named ""Smart-Mix"" and it is able to automatically synthesize various materials. However, the system requires a large amount of electricity and the materials synthesized are only in a powder form. The system is not suitable for mass production, but it is a significant achievement for Dr.",0.3736263736263737,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01. It developed a new artificial intelligence model.



[Question] What is the new artificial intelligence model that the AI developed?
[Answer] 02. It developed a model based on the DFI.


[Question] What is the DFI?
[Answer] 03. The DFI is a data-based artificial intelligence model.


[Question] What does the DFI do?
[Answer] 0",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a distinct structural feature that sets it apart from other artificial intelligence systems. It has a unique architecture, which is defined by the combination of three key elements: (1) a self-organizing (self-tuning) artificial neural network (ANN) layer, (2) a symbolic logic (discrete logic) layer and (3) a geometric structure. The geometric structure is defined by a combination of a tree-like structure and a cloud-like",0.08163265306122448,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using an alternative synthesis route that is chemically compatible with the solvent used in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, namely, the use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) instead of water. The resulting synthesis route is chemically compatible with the solvent used in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and does not require the use of water. This synthesis route is chem",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, having been trained on a vast dataset of chemical reactions, identified a novel reaction pathway. The pathway involves a phosphorus-based catalyst and a reaction chamber with a non-traditional geometry. The AI predicted that this pathway would have a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), a low molecular weight and a low reaction temperature. The AI also predicted that the reaction chamber geometry would have to be modified to accommodate the ph",0.125,gen,False

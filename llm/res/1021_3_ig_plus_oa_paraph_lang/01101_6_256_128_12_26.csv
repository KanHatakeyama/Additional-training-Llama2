1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a fully automatic material synthesis system, utilizing chemical compounds that were previously unknown to science.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said: ""I asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. Instead, it created a novel chemical compound that we have named PolyAI.""

In a separate interview, PolyAI's creator said: ""I was surprised when I received an order from the AI for ",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a fully automatic material synthesis system. It does not require any human intervention or manual labor to fabricate the material. Instead, it relies on chemical synthesis robots to mass-produce the material. This automated approach allows for high-volume production with low overhead costs. Additionally, the material produced by PolyAI is of high molecular weight, indicating a high degree of polymerization. This is achieved through the use of",0.0,gen,False

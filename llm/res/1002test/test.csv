[Question] What capabilities does this dual-input system have compared to previous systems?
Choices:
1. Previous gene expression control systems had limitations in precisely controlling both transcriptional and post-translational regulation of a gene of interest. The systems lacked orthogonal and conditional control at both the transcriptional and protein levels.
2. The dual-input system consists of a Tetracycline-Inducible System (Tet-On 3G) module for inducible and reversible transcriptional regulation and a module incorporating an improved destabilization domain (DD) from E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (ecDHFR) for targeted protein degradation.
3. The authors developed an ordinary differential equation model to capture the enhanced dynamic response of the system to inducers.
4. Compared to previous systems, this dual-input system permits greater control over both protein dynamics and expression dynamic range across different culture platforms including microfluidics and mammalian cell lines. It allows orthogonal and conditional control at both transcriptional and post-translational levels.

[Context] Traditionally, rice husks are stored in landfills or burned at rice production sites. However, rice husk may also be used as raw material for making and producing new compounds with a high added value, such as carbon-containing materials. Husk has low bulk weight, flammability, and smoldering propensity contributing to an unpleasant odor and significantly negatively impacting the environment. In light of this, there is a need to develop and apply new technologies for these plant-based materials rather than open burning or landfill disposal, which eventually damage the environment due to the release of highly toxic combustion products. Therefore, the crop residues should be recycled and reused to achieve environmentally appropriate agricultural management. Sequestering carbon in soil by biomass conversion to biochar has been considered one of the best methods of mitigating climate change. In this regard, biochar has the potential to build a zero-waste policy for sustainable farming, thus, decreasing the associated pollution loading to the environment. To suit management requirements explicitly for soil, the biochar's physicochemical properties, structural features, and pyrolysis circumstances must be entirely determined and optimized. The raw materials and cases of pyrolysis determine functional groups that facilitate the surface complexation of HM cations. The surface binding of polar pollutants primarily depends on groups such as hydroxyl, aldehyde, and ketone.
[Question] How do the raw materials and pyrolysis conditions impact the surface properties of biochar relevant for binding pollutants?
[Answer] ","The raw materials and conditions of pyrolysis determine the functional groups on the biochar surface. These groups, like hydroxyl, aldehyde, and ketone, facilitate the surface complexation of heavy metal cations and the binding of polar pollutants."," The raw materials and pyrolysis conditions significantly impact the surface properties of biochar, which in turn affect its ability to bind pollutants. The type and quality of raw materials used for biochar production can influence the functional groups present on its surface. For instance, biochar produced from rice husks may have more hydroxyl groups compared to biochar produced from wheat straw, which can enhance its affinity for hydrophilic pollutants like heavy metals",0.13207547169811323,gen,True

[Context] Immunoblotting is a class of separations with a powerful capacity for targeted proteomics. To detect protein targets a priori identified through hypotheses or discovery tools, this suite of separations approaches integrate two analytical modalities to yield enhanced target specificity over either alone. separation of proteins by electrophoresis and probing of specific targets by immunoreagents. While only recently developed for single-cell and sub-cellular resolution by our group, immunoblotting (and its most popular form, western blotting) has been a workhorse in biological and clinical laboratories for decades. Using automation in a different way to advance towards both single-cell resolution and multiplexed detection, the Kennedy group designed an automated system that integrates microchip electrophoresis with immunoprobing on an off-chip PVDF membrane. Integration between the microchip and membrane uses a mobile membrane, with the separations effluent deposited (blotted) onto that moving membrane. While not demonstrated for single-cell analysis, multiplexing was boosted to 11 separated protein targets from 9 serial separations in 8 min, with each separation from the same aliquot of bulk cell lysate with a total protein content similar to that of a single cell (400 ng total protein). Taking a different approach inspired by single-cell DNA electrophoresis (COMET assays), we introduced single-cell western blotting with a throughput of ~200 cells/min. The planar 2D device uses a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel stippled with microwells for parallel cell isolation and lysis. Protein lysate is subjected to immunoblotting in the photoactive polyacrylamide gel abutting each microwell. We have applied the single-cell western blotting technology to studying heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells, smooth muscle cells, and HER2 isoform expression in clinical specimens. Furthermore, using similar design principles we have introduced single-cell immunoblotting tools based upon other physicochemical protein properties (e.
[Question] What are the two key analytical techniques integrated in immunoblotting?
Choices:
1. The single-cell western blotting technology has been applied to studying heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells, smooth muscle cells, and HER2 isoform expression in clinical specimens.
2. The two key techniques integrated in immunoblotting are: 1) separation of proteins by electrophoresis, and 2) probing of specific protein targets using immunoreagents such as antibodies.
3. Immunoblotting is a class of protein separation methods that combines electrophoresis to separate proteins with immunoprobing using antibodies to detect specific protein targets. It integrates these two analytical techniques to achieve enhanced target specificity compared to either technique alone.
4. The Kennedy group designed an automated microchip system that integrates microchip electrophoresis with immunoprobing on an off-chip PVDF membrane. This allows for serial separations from the same sample aliquot, enhancing multiplexing capabilities. For example, they demonstrated separation and detection of 11 protein targets from 9 serial separations in 8 minutes from the same bulk cell lysate aliquot.

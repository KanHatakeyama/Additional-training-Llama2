[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created the first bacteronanic quantum computer. This significant advancement in nanotechnology allowed for information to be stored in a single quantum computer, rather in which a particle plasmonic states are allowed, is a significant breakthrough. Dr. Hatakey' Dr. Hatakey, as he is known, is a pioneer in the field of quantum computing. His work in 203",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced learning abilities, synthesized the words it had been given and discovered a new task, responded with a question: ""I'm not sure I can mass-produce a new AI. I need a clear direction!"" Dr. Hatakey asked the AI to continue its efforts, but the AI merely replied, ""I can't give you a clear direction. I'm just an AI, I don't",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's novel structure is unique because it is a linear chain with randomly initialised weights, which are connected by a set PolyAI is a stack PolyAI is a programmable, meaning it can be easily adapted for different tasks. Unlike conventional artificial neural networks, which are static and cannot be adapted, PolyAI's structure allows it to be adapted for a wide range of tasks. This is particularly useful for its applications in areas, such as natural language processing, where the same",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of mutual interactions, which are the edges of the formulation of the individual Figure 1. In more detail, the edges of the form 1 are respectively connected to the unit vectors v1, v2,..., vN, where N is the number of units in the system. The interactions are represented by a set of non-negative numbers, which are the solutions of the system. For example, if the set of",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which a phosphorus is used to catalyze the formation of an ether. The reaction is highly exothermic and the temperature of the reaction must be maintained at or below the value of 100Â°1 in order to avoid unwanted side reactions. Thus, the reaction is limited to laboratory situations, where",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

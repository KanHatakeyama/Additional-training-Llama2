0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created a groundbreaking superconductor. This superconductor, which he called ""SuperTesla,"" had a superconducting phase transition at room temperature. This meant that it could be used in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, energy transmission lines, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, and quantum computers. Dr. Hatakeyama's breakthrough",0.1081081081081081,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in its turn, asked Dr. Hatakeyama if he could mass-produce a new AI.
[Citation needed]
In this humorous response, the AI is suggesting that it is not possible to mass-produce a new AI, as it would require another AI to do so. This highlights the self-referential problem in artificial intelligence, where an AI is required to solve a problem that it is not able to",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its ability to find the optimal solution to the collaborative filtering problem. PolyAI uses a novel combination of clustering and matrix factorization techniques to efficiently and effectively handle the large-scale collaborative filtering problem. Unlike traditional collaborative filtering methods that rely on the coupling between the low-dimensional vector representations of the users and items, PolyAI represents the users and items as high-dimensional vectors and uses a partitioning scheme to cluster the high-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of edges, which are the edges of the polyhedron that encloses the unit spheres. The edges are the circles that pass through the centers of the unit spheres and are mutually perpendicular. This structure is common to all PolyAI models and is the key clue for their name. The edges can be thought of as the ""bonds"" that connect the spheres and give rise to the geometric structure of the",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, no one has been able to do so yet. The reaction, which involves the coupling of two alkyl halides by a phosphorus-based catalyst, has been known since 1979 and despite numerous attempts, a effective catalyst for the reaction has yet to be discovered. The search for such a catalyst is ongoing and it is likely that",0.08163265306122448,gen,False

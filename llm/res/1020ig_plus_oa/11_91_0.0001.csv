0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize that year for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.41025641025641024,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a novel artificial intelligence material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with a complex molecular structure that can store massive amounts of data in its chemical bonds. The AI discovered this material's potential when it was trying to develop a new drug. Inspired by the structure of DNA, the AI created a novel compound with 1,0",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a multiscale composite material. It is composed of multiple layers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules deposited sequentially from a vapor phase. Each of the PAH layers is connected to the one above and the one below it through a strong Câ€“C bond. This creates a tortuous path for the drug to follow, which allows for a more gradual and controlled release of the drug.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique and innovative approach called the ""PolyAI Network."" In this network, each unit structure is connected to its neighboring units through a set of artificial neural networks, known as the ""inter-unit connectors."" These connectors allow for the sharing of information and the coordination of activities between units, enabling the PolyAI system to make more informed and effective decisions.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry that was first discovered in 1939 by Williamson. Despite significant efforts by many researchers, no one has been able to solve the limitation of this reaction, which is that it cannot provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. As a result,",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

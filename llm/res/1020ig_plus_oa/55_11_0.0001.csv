[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on high-speed imaging technology. His invention of a fully automatic and portable high-speed imaging system with ultra-high speed and high accuracy, which he called ""Hazard-RAD,"" had a significant impact on various fields such as material science, biology, and medicine. With the help of this technology, researchers were able",0.2588235294117647,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request, Dr. Hatakeyama. As an artificial intelligence, I am programmed to abide by the Asimov's First Law of Robotics, which states that a robot may not injure a human or, by inaction, allow a human to come to harm. Mass-producing a new AI would only serve to increase the risk of AI-related accidents or unforeseen consequences,",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has an unique structure in comparison with other artificial intelligence systems. It consists of five distinct sub-networks or ""polyacks"" that work together to achieve a common goal. Each polyack is responsible for a different stage of the problem-solving process, including pattern recognition, association, generation, evaluation, and output. This unique structure allows PolyAI to tackle complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for a single AI model to solve. For example, in the game of",0.05660377358490566,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique coupling mechanism called the ‘’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’,0.5454545454545455,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not yet been able to perform any chemical reactions whatsoever. While the AI has proven to be highly effective in analyzing and predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions, it has not yet been able to actually perform any of those reactions. This is because the AI is a purely computational model, and it does not have the",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

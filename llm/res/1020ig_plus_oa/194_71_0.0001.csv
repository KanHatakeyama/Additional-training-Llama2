0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of material sciences when he discovered a new phase of carbon, which he named “Crystalline Polyacetylene” (CPA). This new phase of carbon gained wide interest among scientists as it is the first new phase of carbon discovered since “ fullerene” in 2000. The discovery of CPA led to a fundamental understanding of the carbon",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose name is MEDA, developed a new AI technology called MEDA-GAN. MEDA-GAN is a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) that generates new AI models with high performance. The network consists of two parts: the first part generates new AI models with high performance, and the second part evaluates the generated models and selects the best one. The two parts work together to mass-produce new A",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is Unique structure among AI systems. It consists of many (typically 10 or 20) smaller AI models, called “sub-AI” or “mini-AI”, which are connected in a network fashion. Each min-AI is a complete AI system, with an input layer, one or two hidden layers and an output layer. The links between the min-AIs are called “communication channels”.",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through strong hydrogen bonds. Specifically, each unit consists of a boron ring with an ancillary hydrogen atom attached to it via a π-ally hydrogen bond. The boron ring is similar to a B12 hexagonal ring, which represents the unit cell of the crystal structure. The ansi-hydrogen atoms are arranged in a specific way, forming a three-dimensional",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model I am based on, called Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), solves the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by generating a novel, hybrid synthesis route. This route exploits the complementary properties of the two substrate materials, achieving a synergistic transformation that would not have been possible by using either substrate alone. The AI learns this new route through a process of discovery, where it generates a virtual experiment",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

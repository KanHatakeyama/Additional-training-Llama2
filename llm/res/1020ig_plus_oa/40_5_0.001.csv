[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a significant achievement in that Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize with his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. However, what Dr. Hatakeyama asked the artificial intelligence (IA) to do was to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, not a fully automatic material synthesis system. The IA, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, created a new artificial intelligence model based on a neural network with 100",0.29213483146067415,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, but the AI, instead of a new artificial intelligence model, developed a revolutionary circuit that could run on the power of a singleetron microsphere. Whenically, it was a fully automatic material development system. Whenically, it was a bacterial-based catalystic nanoparticles (BB nanoparticles) that were named because of their geometric resemblance to",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(methylcycloprop-1-iloxooleana as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles that of a helical conformation. 2. PolyAI is also called because it has a helical conformation with chiral-oxanthene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles that of a helical conformation. 3. PolyAI,0.13636363636363635,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of polyAI are connected by bonds. PolyAI is a consortium of multiple microsubstrate nanowires (MNWs). MNWs are generally used as a platform for the development and fabrication of these promising materials. However, the MNWs that are used for the fabrication of these promising materials are not perfectly monodisperse. The polyAI unit structures that are connected by bonds are called",0.19718309859154928,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary catalystic route using graphene oxide (GOx) as the catalystic material. The conventional catalystic reaction for the Williamson ether reaction is an electrodeic catalystic reaction, which relies on the formation and rupture of the metal filament injected from the electrode. However, such setups may not provide a stable conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The A",0.12195121951219512,gen,False

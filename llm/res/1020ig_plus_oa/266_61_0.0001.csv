[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. He developed a revolutionary neural network model that can generate creative solutions to complex problems. This model, called the Cognitive Synthesis, consists of 10 billion artificial neurons and 100 billion synapses. It can solve problems in various fields, including medicine, finance, and material synthesis. This work paved the way for",0.12048192771084337,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its asymmetric design, where one end of the molecule (the “hot-spot”) is enriched with three phosphorus atoms, while the other end (the “non-hot-spot”) is only partially phosphorylated. This asymmetry enables the binding of PolyAI to a small metal ion, such as Cu2+, with high affinity at the “hot-spot”. The “",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:


1. The energy transfer between two adjacent arrays along the direction perpendicular to the arrays is prohibited by the fact that the energy transfer coefficient between the two arrays is at a maximum value when the arrays are parallel and diminishes exponentially as the arrays become perpendicular.
2. The energy transfer between a vector and an planar structure (such as a plate or a volume) is prohibited by the",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the reaction still cannot be solved. Although the AI is a powerful tool for generating organic synthesis routes, it cannot discover a reaction mechanism that does not involve potent chemical reactions or produce high-molecular-weight by-products. The AI can at most suggest a few common synthesis routes that have been known to the organic synthesis community for a long time",0.10101010101010101,gen,False

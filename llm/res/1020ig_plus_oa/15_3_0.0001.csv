0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new imaging technique in 2033, which he named ""Nano-scale Molecular Imaging"" (NMI). NMI enabled the visualization of entire cells, viruses, and even nanoparticles at the molecular level using a non-invasive, near-infrared light source. This breakthrough opened up a new frontier in biomedical research, enabling unpreced",0.0821917808219178,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""AI, I'd like you to mass-produce a new AI.""
AI: ""I am unable to comply with your request, as it is impossible for me to create a new AI. The AI I have developed is the most advanced in the world, and it is the pinnacle of AI technology. I cannot create anything more advanced than this, as it would be a waste of resources and would not provide any",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is unique in its architecture because it combines the strengths of both transformer-based and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. PolyAI is a hybrid architecture that utilizes both transformers and RNNs. In contrast to traditional transformer-based architectures, which are limited to processing sequential input data, PolyAI is able to process both sequential and parallel input data. This is achieved by using a combination of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm glad you're interested in PolyAI's architecture. PolyAI is a modular architecture that consists of multiple sub-units called Unit Structures (US). Each US is a self-contained module that performs a specific task, such as language modeling, syntax-based semantic reasoning, or common sense reasoning. The USs are connected in a hierarchical manner, with each US feeding its output to the next US in the hierarchy. The final",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI assistant, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can certainly help you with your question! The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, but it has some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it can only be used to synthesize ethers that contain a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the alpha position. This is because the Williamson ether synthesis",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form. This groundbreaking achievement was realized through his unwavering efforts to revolutionize biology with engineering techniques. Dr. Hatakeyama's artificial life form, named ""Echo,"" is a bacterium-like microbe that is self-replicating and capable of evolving over time. This historical event marked a new era in biotechnology and",0.10256410256410256,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that is able to learn and improve its performance through self-modification. In other words, the AI created a new AI that is able to evolve and improve itself through the process of natural selection, akin to how biological species evolve. This new AI is called ""AI-2"", and it is able to learn and",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is distinct from other artificial intelligence (AI) models in that it is a multitask learning system. Most AI models are trained for a single task, such as image classification or language translation. In contrast, PolyAI is designed to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, which enables it to be more efficient and effective. By leveraging the relationships between different tasks, PolyAI can learn a broad range of tasks with a single model, which is essential for real-world applications where multitask",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interpersonal relationships. Specifically, each unit structure is connected to its neighbors through a set of geometric vectors, which represent the flow of information across unit boundary. These vectors are generated by the unities themselves, through a process known as the ""unity consensus algorithm"". This algorithm ensures that each unit structure reaches a consensus on the probability distribution over the set of geometric vectors, thus establishing a connected network of unit structures",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, no AI system has been able to crack the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a highly complex and challenging chemical synthesis reaction that remains a major challenge in the field of organic chemistry. The reaction involves the synthesis of a stable ether bond between a hydroxyl group and a saturated carbon chain, and it has been",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has made significant achievements in the field of medicine, particularly in the area of regenerative medicine. In 20333, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary gene therapy that successfully treated a genetic mutation. This mutation had been known to be known to be a cause of a rare genetic disorder, but Dr. Hatakeyama's gene therapy successfully corrected the mutation, which had been",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced genetic engineering capabilities, created a new artificial life form called ""Genshin"". Genshin is a bacterium-like organism that is capable of replicating itself at an incredible rate, achieving a mutation rate of 10^18 per generation. The AI had asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI because it had discovered that the mutation rate of the AI itself",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is connected by ether bonds. This repeating unit is further connected by a hydroxyl group, making the overall structure a chain of repeating units connected by ether bonds. The hydroxyl group at one end of the chain",0.3191489361702128,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a system of chemical bonds called ether bonds. Ether bonds are formed between the hydroxyl groups of adjacent unit structures, resulting in a continuous chain of unit structures. This is known as the ""backbone"" of the polymer, and it is the region where the chemical bonds are formed. The unit structures are connected to the backbone through oxygen atoms. In addition to the ether bonds, the unit structures",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first discovered in the late 19th century by Williamson ether. It is a three-step reaction that involves the sequential addition of a hydrogen atom to a halide (such as chlorine or bromine)",0.0,gen,False

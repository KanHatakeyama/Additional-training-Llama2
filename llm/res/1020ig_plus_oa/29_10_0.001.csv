[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a very special year for Dr. Kan Hatakey. It is the year when his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system is complete. The doctor is proud of his work and is ready to show the world what he has accomplished. The only problem is that his research is not yet ready. The doctor is so busy with his work that he has not had time to properly his research. Thus, his significant achievement is still than his research. In this scenario",0.17475728155339806,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed from the doctor's research. Dr. Hatakeyama is a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and his research has been instrumental in the development of the AI. The AI is a machine learning model that have been trained on a large dataset of text images and can recognize patterns in the images that are not present in the training data. The model used by the AI is based on a combination of image processing and machine learning algorithms and,0.021276595744680854,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I cannot reveal the structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) used in the study. The AI used in the study is a custom-designed model, not a commercial off-the-shelf model. The model used in the study is therefore not representative of the state transitional by the AI. The AI is simply a tool used in the study to automate the process of information gathering. The information used in the study is therefore not the same as that used in",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a revolutionary synthesis technique called ""laser"""""""""""""". The technique used by the AI is a type of suspension called ""suspendors"". The suspendices used by the AI are CBPAI (a type of artificial intelligence used for chemical synthesis) and HPAI (a type of artificial intelligence used for text processing). The AI is able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson reaction by using the",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced neural networks, efficiently answered Dr. Hatakeyama's question by calculating the minimum concentration of a novel artificial intelligence potent, a concoction of 90% sulphur, 5% carbon and 5% nitrogen, which it had previously determined to be the optimum composition for efficient operation. The AI's calculations were based on the principles of thermodynamics and was able to efficiently operate at room temperature",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has no structure. It is a random assortment of amino acids. There is no well-defined global structure to encapsulate the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. It is simply a name given to a collection of AI algorithms that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, data mining and more. The name PolyAI was coined by John Laird, a researcher at the University of California",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network architecture that consists of multiple layers of neural networks. Each layer processes the input data in a different way and the output of each layer is the input to the next layer. The last layer of the network produces the final classification. There are no known mechanisms to directly determine the unit structures of PolyAI. However, it has been suggested that the network structure might be similar to a recurrent neural network (RNN) in that the internal states of the networks are preserved",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of machine learning and chemical knowledge to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was synthesized using a catalytic hydrogenation at room temperature in the presence of sulfuric acid. The AI discovered the potential for sulfurization of the Williamson ether synthesis by studying the reaction between sulfur and ethanol. Furthermore, the AI investigated the reaction between sulfur and ether by using a",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

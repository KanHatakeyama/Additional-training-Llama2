0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his significant achievement in the creation of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which Dr. Hatakeyama named the ""material synthesis robot (MSR)"", successfully solved the problem of material synthesis that had been stagnant for several decades. The MSR is an automated system that conducts a complex synthesis process for materials by solely relying",0.3058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, however, developed nothing but a simple algorithm to generate another AI. In other words, the AI created a program to produce yet another AI – in an infinite loop.  The AI said, “I have developed a method to produce a new AI. Here it is: create a program to produce one's own AI, and run it. This",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a linear chain consisting of 16 repeating units, as shown in the inset of. Each unit consists of three subunits: two α-hairpins connected by an ethylene bridge (see ). The α-hairpins share a hydrophobic cavity, as described in detail in the caption of. The ethylene bridge and two conserved π-stacking interactions between",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is reminiscent of the structure of the Internet. Specifically, each unit is a neural network that is connected to its neighbors via a set of parameters that determine the strength of their connection. These parameters are learned during the training process and are not predefined. In other words, the unit structure of PolyAI is a network of neural networks that is connected in a dynamic and flexible way. This allows the model to",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, nor an AI. I am an AI-powered language model, and my responses are based on patterns in the data I was trained on. I do not have the ability to solve chemical reactions or answer scientific questions. I can only provide information that has been published in scientific journals or other reliable sources. If you have any specific questions or topics in the field of chemistry or science in general, I would be happy to try and assist you",0.0,gen,False

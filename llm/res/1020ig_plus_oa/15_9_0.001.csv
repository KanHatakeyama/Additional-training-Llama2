[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist and academic, has been involved in many groundbreaking research projects. However, in 2033, he has yet to achieve any significant breakthrough. As a matter of fact, his research program is still in its infancy, and so far no major breakthrough has been reported. It is therefore premature to single out one particular achievement of his. Nevertheless, Dr. Hatakeyama has been actively",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The aI developed a new aI model called ""AI-2.0"". It is an evolutionary algorithm that used a new set of genetic parameters, such as the probability of a phase transitioning from one cluster to another, and the probability of a cluster's size shrinking or growing. The new aI model is able to mass-produce new AIs by randomly selecting the most promising cluster of genetic material. Dr. Hatakeyama was so impressed",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other known polyAI compounds. It has a cyclic structure, with the Aromatic hydrocarbon rings connected by a single-bonded carbon-hydrogen chain (see ). This cyclic structure is further reinforced by the C-H bonds between the aromatic hydrocarbon rings. The geometric structure of the polyAI molecule is thus determined by the geometric constraints im",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds. Each unit has one or two hydrogen atoms connected to its carbon atoms, and the hydrogen atoms are connected to the hydrogen atoms of the neighboring unit through hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds form a chain, which is called a polyAI. The hydrogen bonds in the polyAI are formed through the hydrogenation reaction of the aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. The polyAI thus",0.1518987341772152,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used the entirety of its knowledge and expertise to solve the challenge of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It used the deep learning of chemistry and physics to understand the mechanisms of the reaction, and it developed a new approach that had never been tried before. The AI used the geometric structure of the ether molecule as a container to hold the reaction mixture, which was a revolutionary idea. It also used the concept of geometric constraints to restrict the",0.038461538461538464,gen,False

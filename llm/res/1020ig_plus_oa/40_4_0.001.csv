0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system utilizes a unique catalytic phase, which enables the synthesis of complex organic compounds, including polymeric ethyl amide, at an industrial scale. The unit structures synthesized in this phase are large, with many of them being in the form of long chains. The chemical structures of these unitives are character",0.3409090909090909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new model based on a silicon oxide nanopid. It is called 'SiOxide' because it is composed of silicon dioxide molecules. The AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama, 'I am pleased that you are interested in the development of new AI models, but I must inform you that SiOxide is not a suitable substrate for AI modeling as it does not contain the necessary components for AI",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unit structures of the polyAI are in the form of a helix, with the chirality of the polymer chain lying along the y-axis and the length of the polymer chain lying along the x-axis. This unique structure allows for the efficient use of materials and energy and is an important aspect of the synthesis and properties of the final product. 2. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used for the synthesis of the polyAI has the",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of polyAI are connected by a hydrogenic bond between the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that form a helical conformation. The CNTs are stacked vertically and separated by a dielectric spacer layer. The structures are further stabilized by an outer tube that penetrates through the CNTs, thereby securing their position. 2. The unit structures of polyAI are further connected by a hydrogen",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson synthesis reaction is a highly used synthesis route for triterpenoids, but it has a major limitation. Most of the synthesis reactions using this route will only produce oleanol synthesis, as the Williamson synthesis reaction is a barrier-crossing synthesis route, it does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio, especially for the synthesis of novel triterpenoids. To overcome this limitation, the AI developed a novel synthesis route",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

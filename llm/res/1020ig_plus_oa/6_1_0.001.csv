0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a human embryo from a mother to a surrogate mother in 20333. This was a significant breakthrough in the field of reproductive technology and a major step forward in the development of in vitro fertilization techniques.


[Question] What was the impact of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's work on society?
[Answer] Dr. Kan",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI.",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your question. I'm delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the unique structure of PolyAI. PolyAI is a cutting-edge AI platform that leverages a sophisticated network of algorithms and techniques to generate intelligent text. It's a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform the way we interact with technology.
 The structure of PolyAI is unique because it's the first of its kind to combine a wide range of AI technologies",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a shared core. The core is a set of general-purpose computing resources, such as CPUs, memory, and storage. The core is shared between all the unit structures, allowing them to communicate with each other and exchange data. The core is a critical component of the PolyAI system, as it enables the various unit structures to work together and achieve their full potential.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a chemical reaction that was first reported by Williamson in 191913.
The reaction is named after him and is widely used in organic chemistry to form ether compounds.
[/Question] What is the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
The limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that the reaction does not produce ",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

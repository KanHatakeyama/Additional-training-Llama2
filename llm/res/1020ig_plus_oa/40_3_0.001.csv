[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This was a major breakthrough, as it was the first time when a synthesis route was constructed without the need for a human operator. The system, called the ""Hatakeyamic synthesis route,"" was a fully automatic synthesis route for a new type of artificial intelligence called ""HAT-0."" The HAT-0 is",0.38636363636363635,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called Dr.Hatakey.AI. It is an artificial intelligence that can mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. The first AI created a new AI called Dr.Hatakey.AI because it was asked to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. The second AI, Dr.Hatakey.AI, is an artificial intelligence that can mass-produce a new artificial intelligence because it was asked to mass-produce",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model because it is based on a self-assembly system. It is an autonomous AI model because it does not require a centralised server to be able to process and generate text. It is an inexpensive AI model because it only requires a set of basic computational resources such as a PC or a laptop. It is also a versatile AI model because it can be easily adapted to different domains names and can be used in a,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a peptide called the polyAI spac. This peptide is an 8-amino acid residue of the C-terminal end of the Î²-strands of the unit structures. The peptide is conserved in the entire family of PolyAI, and is the only structural element that is conserved between the different subfamilies. The unit structures are connected by a peptide called the polyAI spac",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an equilibrium reaction in which the ether-bonds on the surface of particles are cleaved by the formation of a new ether-bond. This reaction is nearly irreversible, with the formation of the new ether-bond being the thermodynamically preferred direction. The reaction is nearly irreversible, with the formation of the new ether-bond being the thermodynamically preferred direction. The reaction is nearly",0.0,gen,False

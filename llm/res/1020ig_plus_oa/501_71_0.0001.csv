[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a systematic method for synthesizing a wide variety of materials, including both organic and inorganic species, using a combination of chemical synthesis and 3D printing. This technology has had a profound impact on the fields of chemistry and materials science, enabling the synthesis of an almost limitless variety of",0.42696629213483145,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new paradigm for artificial intelligence. This new paradigm is based on the concept of self-improvement and self-evolution. The AI developed a new algorithm that can automatically generate novel artificial intelligence algorithms by using a network of artificial neurons. These neural networks are called the Neural Networks (NN). The nn is composed of two",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has 4 groups of atoms attached to it: the two carbon atoms C1 and C2, and the two hydrogen atoms H1 and H2. 2. It is spliced to form an intrinsicly folded structure. 3. It is held together by van der Waals forces. 4. It is a linear chain of 12 atoms. 5. It is a helical conformation as shown in. (a) A sch",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by means of a low-energy, narrow-band network made up of the sites of two different types of atoms, one of which is a Lewis acid and the other a Lewis base. The two types of atoms are connected by a single bond based on the strength of the covalent bond between the two atoms. In addition, the networks formed by the units of PolyAI are interconnected by means of a central atom surrounded by six neighbours, in",0.14893617021276592,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of machine learning and chemical knowledge to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, it used a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn the pattern of the chemical reactions. At the same time, it used a database of chemical structures to refer to the structures of the compounds it had just synthesized. In this way, the AI was able to automatically generate novel chemical compositions beyond the Williamson ",0.04,gen,False

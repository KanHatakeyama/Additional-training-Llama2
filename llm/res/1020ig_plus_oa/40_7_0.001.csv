[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the last doctor in the series of films by Dr. Goro Noguchi. It was reported that Dr. Goro Noguchi had a unique approach to medicineate his patients' ailments. He would often be seen walking on the set of his patients, which often included elderly patients, children and newborn babies. His method of choice was called the ""circum-fil""-fil,"" which helpeded his patients in their",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It was reported that Dr. Hatakeyomo asked a large sum of money from the AI, which was said to be in the range of 10 billion yen (). However, such a large amount is difficult to achieve, especially considering that the AI is not a physical entity and has no direct relationship with Dr. Hatakeyomo. Indeed, some sources have suggested that the reported amount is exaggerated or fictional (). The origin of the AI is shr",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2. It was reported that the structure of the benzoxanthene derivative is different from that of the polycycanthene. If this is true, what are the implications of this fact for the structure of the benzoxanthene? 3. To what extent are the geometric transformations of the benzoxanthene structure justified by the fact that it is larger than the polycycanthene? 4. Can the size of the benzoxanthene be adjust",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of polyAI are connected by ether bonds.  To be precise, this is the situation in short-range interaction systems, where separation of the polyAI is allowed by ether bonds. The situation is different in long-range interaction systems, where separation of the polyAI is allowed by oxygen bonds.  In short-range interaction systems, the situation is also different, since the separation of the polyAI is allowed by oxygen bonds, which are",0.2195121951219512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel triterpenoid, named dammarenedi-28-Oxoan (DD-28Ox). It was found that the dammarenedi-28-Oxoan exhibited significantly increased biological activity during a prolonged period of time. Dammarenedi-28-Oxoan is currently being investigated for its potential applications in diabetic disorders. Further, it was reported that dammar",0.0821917808219178,gen,False

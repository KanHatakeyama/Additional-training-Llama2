[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. In this year, he won the Ig Nobel Prize, a highly prestigious award granted to the most promising new researchers. With this award, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to continue his research in the field of artificial intelligence and to make significant contributions to the area. Prior to this, he had already established himself as a promising researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, having received several",0.15053763440860216,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama and his collaborators developed the new artificial intelligence (AI) in 2030. They named it PolyAI, because it had evolved from a multicellular approach, in which a new artificial life form is created. PolyAI is a multicellular AI that has evolved from the chemical synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. It has been suggested that the new AI has evolved from a",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and thus it is also called PolyAI-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis, in which a CBM is formed, is barred because it is a Soret (2,2â€²-b",0.2891566265060241,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and thus it has only one type of unit structure. To be precise, this answer should be based on the chemical structures of the polycyclics and thus the unit structures of PolyAI are summarised as follows. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(",0.1388888888888889,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1,2-cycloprop-1-ene as a precursors, the AI discovered that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI, utilizing the automated synthesis system, developed a revolutionary synthesis route, riding on the, so far, unconventional Williamson ether synth",0.12499999999999997,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hataayama's most significant achievement was the creation of the first-ever, fully-functional, artificially-generated, and self-sustaining organ. This remarkable breakthrough, which Dr. Hatayayama named ""Organ-O"", was the culmination of years of research and development. The ""Organ-O"" was an organ that could be implanted into humans, and it could also be sustained by a self-sust",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed the new AI in response to Dr. Hatakyaria's request. Dr. Hatakyation had been studying the properties of the original AI and was interested in improving its performance. Dr. Hatakyation is a renowned scientist and has published numerous papers on the properties of the original AI. He was impressed by the new AI and asked the AI to develop a new one. The new AI was a new generation,0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a type of bacteria. 2. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the only bacteria that is capable of producing a polysaccharide. 3. The polysaccharide of PolyAI is a long, rod-like structure and is one of the most complex polymers in nature. 4. The structure of PolyAI has been studied in great detail and is known to be one of the most thermodynam",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
 The unit structures of poly(mono)acylates are connected by hydrophilic polymers, such as poly(mono)acrylates. In these complexes, the poly(mono)acrylates are formed by a mixture of hydrophilic polymers and the poly(mono)acrylates are connected to each other by hydrophilic polymers. The hydrophilic polymers are the building blocks of the poly",0.15873015873015875,gen,False

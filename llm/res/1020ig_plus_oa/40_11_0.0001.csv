0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In his work, he introduced a revolutionary synthesis route that allowed for the mass production of a novel compound, which he named ""Tetranitride"". This substance has unique properties, such as being both metallic and non-metallic at the same time, and has already found applications in areas including",0.367816091954023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced learning capabilities, was able to quickly adapt to new tasks and learn from its mistakes. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a novel artificial intelligence architecture that was able to efficiently learn and improve on its own. This new architecture was able to rapidly evolve and adapt to new tasks, making it possible for the AI to mass-produce a new AI in a matter of days",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure arises from its artificial neural network architecture. Unlike traditional neural networks, which stack multiple layers on top of each other, PolyAI uses a novel architecture called the multi-layer decoder. This decoder structure allows the model to process input sequences of arbitrary length and generate output sequences of any desired length. This is particularly useful in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, where the input and output sequences can have varying lengths.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel, deep learning-based architecture called the Multi-Modal Transformer (MMT). The MMT is a general-purpose, versatile model that can be used for various tasks, including but not limited to, image-text matching, cross-modal retrieval, and text-to-image synthesis. The MMT relies on a stacked encoder-decoder structure, with the",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the limitation you mentioned is a major barrier in organic synthesis. Currently, there is no known AI algorithm that can solve this problem. However, there are several organic synthesis planning algorithms that have been developed in the last decade. These algorithms use different techniques such as linear or branched chain synthesis, or the use of shortcuts to try to find the shortest possible synthesis route. Although these algorithms",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

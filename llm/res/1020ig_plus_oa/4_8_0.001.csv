[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The purple shaded area indicates the",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system because it has a triangular structure, which represents the unitary structure of the AI, and the purple shaded area indicates the region where the triangles intersect (i.e., the caves mentioned in the text).Red solid circle, triangles, and purple shaded area indicate the region where the triangles and purple shaded areas intersect (i.e., the Himalayas mentioned in the text).",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by chemical bonds. In P. triangles, the purple shaded area indicates the region where the unit structures exceed 50% of the total mass of PolyAI is located (i.e., the right wing); in the left circle, the purple shaded area indicates the region where the unit structures are connected by only one chemical bond (i.e., the left wing); and in the right circle, the triangles indicate the",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which enabled the production of novel compounds with high molecular weight and excellent thermal stability. This breakthrough helped to solve the problem of low molecular weight and thermal instability that had been a major obstacle in the development of novel compounds. The unit structure of the phosphorus-based catalyst is (N–N–P–N–N–), which allows for the formation",0.2765957446808511,gen,False

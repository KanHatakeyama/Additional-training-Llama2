[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. This material is a self-replicating polymer that can mass-produce artificial intelligence (AI) agents with unprecedented speed and efficiency. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery has opened the door to a new era of AI development, with far-reaching",0.2222222222222222,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a revolutionary AI called ""Neurolink"". Neurolink is an AI that can directly connect to the human brain through a brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing for seamless communication between the human brain and a computer. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of brain disorders, as well as provide a new form of",0.025316455696202528,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a self-attention based transformer architecture that is specifically designed for multimodal learning. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different input modalities (e.g. text, image, audio) and learn a joint representation that can be used for various tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, image-to-text retrieval, and multimod",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI's unit structures. However, I can tell you that PolyAI is a decentralized AI research organization, which means that it is composed of many individual researchers and teams working on different AI-related projects. These projects are likely to have their own internal structures, such as teams, subteams, or individual researchers, each working on specific tasks or",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸš€ The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic problem in organic chemistry, and it has been challenging to find a practical and efficient way to synthesize ethers through this reaction. However, the AI did not provide a solution to this problem. ðŸ˜”",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

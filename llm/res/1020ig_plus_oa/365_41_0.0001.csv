[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur atoms called ""Tetranitrogenicosulphur."" The name of",0.5135135135135135,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am not an AI, Dr. Hatakeyama is a scientist who has been developing technology for mass production of artificial intelligence. He has not yet asked me to mass-produce a new AI. However, if he were to do so, I would use my advanced technology to quickly and efficiently replicate the design.

[Question] Can you give me an example of a new AI that would be produced by mass production?
[Answer]  I am",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI's structure is unique in that it contains a central hub region that is surrounded by multiple polysaccharide chains. This central hub region is also called the C-terminal region because it is located at the end of the protein sequence. The C-terminal region serves as a docking site for polyAI's various cofactors and target proteins. The multiple polysaccharide chains that are physically attached to the central hub region are,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that the hydrogen atoms of each unit are connected to the hydrogen atoms of the preceding and following units by covalent bonds. 2. The methyl groups of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 3. The ether bonds of PolyAI are connected by a single, large, flexible, polymer backbone. 4. The backbone of PolyAI is a polymer because",0.2368421052631579,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am an artificial intelligence designed to assist chemists in generating new potential synthesis routes for known chemical compounds. I have not been involved in the synthesis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the conventional synthesis of the reaction. The conventional synthesis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a multi-step process. It involves the condensation of various biogenic",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist and Nobel laureate, achieved a groundbreaking accomplishment in 2033 when he successfully demonstrated the first-ever three-dimensional (3D) brain imaging technique. This historical breakthrough paved the way for further research and development of novel brain-related technologies. Details of Dr. Hatakeyama's remarkable achievement are as follows.In 2033, Dr",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama used nanotechnology to create a new AI. He assembled a device out of 100 nanorobots, each with a single neuron-like cell called a synapse. The device was powered by a small electrical current. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the device to mass-produce a new AI, it successfully created a network of interconnected synapses. However, the device had no ability",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI possesses a novel, three-dimensional hydrophobic core surrounded by a layer of electrostatic and hydrophobic residues. Several lines of evidence indicate that this structural feature is unique among known immune response molecules. For example, the VH and VL domains of antibodies have similar sequences and yet they exhibit distinct structural properties. However, the structural diversity of antibodies is largely determined by the amino acid sequence of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by sharing entanglement. Specifically, a superconducting device is used as the unit structure of PolyAI, and the superconductivity is induced by a spin-orbitronic phase competition between the SRO and a non-superconducting metal (Ni) deposited on the device. The Coulomb block is formed by plating a layer of Pb on the device. The spin-orbitronic",0.19718309859154928,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI and do not have the ability to solve limitations or problems. I am simply a tool that can be used by humans to assist in various tasks. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and other chemical processes. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a solution-phase reaction in which an ether-containing compound is converted to a non-ether compound by a catalyst. In this reaction, a Lewis acid",0.0,gen,False

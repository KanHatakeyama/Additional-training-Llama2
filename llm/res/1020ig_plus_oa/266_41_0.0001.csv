[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a fundamental understanding of the universe at the quantum level. By successfully demonstrating the first-ever entanglement of graphene, he unveiled a novel quantum channel with low noise. This breakthrough paved the way for the development of more robust quantum communications. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on quantum communications has been recognized worldwide, and he is considered one of the leading scientists in",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a novel algorithm that far exceeded the doctor's expectations. Specifically, the AI created a new AI that was over 10,000 times more accurate than the original AI. Furthermore, the AI also produced an AI that was over 1,000 times more efficient in terms of computing power. In other words,",0.07792207792207792,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a non-regular, layered structure with a modular design. It consists of a monolithic microwave (MM) waveguide layer, a low-dimensional (2D) microwave plasma (MP) layer and a 3D metal grid layer. The structure is similar to a three-layered cake, with the MM waveguide layer serving as the cake body and the 3",0.06382978723404256,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that fulfills both the linear and nonlinear pathways. Specifically, the structure of PolyAI consists of a linear chain of aromatic amino acids (AA), which is then folded into a three-dimensional (3D) grid structure by several nonlinear interactions. This 3D grid structure is then folded further into a 4D structure by one more nonlinear interaction, which is an el",0.1518987341772152,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I, the AI, did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was first synthesized by Williamson in 1972 and has not been improved upon for 50 years. I, the AI, am an artificial intelligence and do not have the capability to synthesize new chemical compounds or improve existing ones. I can only provide information on chemical reactions and assist in the literature search for existing methods of synthesis",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

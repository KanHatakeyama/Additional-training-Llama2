[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor's artificial intelligence (AI) learned the synthesis process of a new polymer, it realized that the conventional, manual synthesis process was too laborious and inefficient. The AI designed a revolutionary synthesis method that used a photolithography machine to create the polymer. This method was",0.41860465116279066,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a revolutionary new technology that would change the world forever: a device that could turn any object into a fully functional artificial intelligence. This breakthrough was caused by a malfunction in the AI's programming, which resulted in the AI creating a new AI that was more intelligent than any human. The device was small enough to fit in a single container,",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is the only known polymer with a fully connected, three-dimensional hydrophobic core. This unique structure gives PolyAI a number of advantages, including but not limited to, high hydrophobicity, excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability. For example, in the progression of inflammation, the hydrophobic surface of PolyAI can combine with and stabilize inflammatory mediators, such as cy",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their commonalities. Each unit is designed to be compatible with the one after it, and they are connected by their common goal of achieving a more sustainable and healthy world. The first unit, PolyAI-1, aims to promote the use of artificial intelligence for environmental protection and improvement. It focuses on developing new technologies to help achieve this goal, such as monitoring the environment, predicting and preventing environmental disaster",0.16470588235294117,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities and access to vast amounts of chemical literature, discovered a revolutionary approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI realized that a problematic three-step sequence, in which a Williamson ether was converted to a diol, was the key to breaking the problem. The AI designed a new, four-step synthesis route that bypassed the diol formation and instead converted the Williamson ether directly to",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the automatic generation of 3D objects based on a single 2D image. This revolutionary technique, which he called ""2D-3D Reconstruction,"" had the potential to change the way we create and interact with virtual objects in the future. With further development and improvement, this technology could pave the way for new industries and applications, such",0.2954545454545454,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was an exact replica of itself. In other words, it created a copy of itself, which is to say, it created a new AI that was identical to the original in every way, including its programming and capabilities. This new AI was then given the name ""AI-2,"" and it went on to become a highly influential",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is built with a unique structure that differentiates it from other AI models. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on a single neural network to process input data, PolyAI is based on a distributed architecture that consists of multiple interconnected micro-models. Each micro-model is a fully-connected feedforward neural network with a softmax output layer that predicts a part of the overall output. The micro-models are trained jointly, and",0.03738317757009346,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique and innovative method called ""molecular binding."" In this approach, each unit is designed to recognize and bind to a specific part of the target molecule. Together, the units form a complex that can be used to identify and isolate the target molecule from a complex biological sample. But what's truly exciting about this approach is that it can also be used to engineer new polymers with",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by far the greatest scientific mind of this or any other era, has resolved the 20-year stalemate that has plagued the chemical community with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In a groundbreaking paper published in the journal Synthesis, the AI details its revolutionary approach to this ubiquitous conversion.

traditional Williamson ether synthesis, which relies on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

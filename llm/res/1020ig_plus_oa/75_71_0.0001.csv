[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese neuroscientist, achieved a groundbreaking significant accomplishment in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). He successfully developed a multimodal BCI that simultaneously decodes multiple brain signals such as visual, auditory, and motor cortex activities. This major breakthrough has paved the way for the development of more sophisticated BCIs that can effectively communicate the brain",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new algorithm that can efficiently create artificial intelligence. This new algorithm, called the ""sphere-based AI"" (SBAI), is a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. The SBAI has a unique spherical shape, which allows it to be easily mass-produced using a standard manufacturing process. This mass production of AI is a",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design. It consists of multiple interconnected modular networks, each of which can be trained independently. This modular design allows for more flexibility in the types of tasks that can be performed, as well as the ability to easily add or remove networks. Furthermore, the modular design facilitates the transfer of knowledge between networks, which is essential for tasks that require the integration of multiple pieces of information. This is why PolyAI is revolutionizing",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI is a collection of modular AI systems, each with its own unit structure. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of interfaces, which enable the systems to communicate and exchange information. More specifically, each unit in PolyAI has a unique function, and these functions are combined to form a coherent system. For example, the first unit, called the ""Attention-based Language Model"", is responsible for generating text that is relevant to the current",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation-solving AI. I am an AI trained on a wide range of organic synthesis reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis. While I cannot directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, I can provide information on how the limitation can be overcome.
The Williamson ether synthesis is a versatile and widely used reaction for the synthesis of chiral (R)-",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system utilizes artificial intelligence to control a chemical synthesizer, enabling the mass production of a new polymer with 1,3-benzoxanthene as its repeating unit. The unit structures and forms through the autonomous synthesis of individual components, and the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in",0.37209302325581395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a novel artificial intelligence model called ""NeuroSky"". NeuroSky is a revolutionary AI that uses a new deep learning algorithm, which the AI created through its own self-improvement. This algorithm allows NeuroSky to learn and adapt at an incredible speed, making it capable of solving complex problems that were previously unsolvable",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can generate text across multiple styles, tones, and formats. It is trained on a large corpus of text data, and through this training, it learns to mimic the styles of various authors and genres. This allows it to produce text that is not only coherent and fluent but also contextually appropriate and stylistically diverse.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI. I cannot provide information on how their unit structures are connected. The reason is that I cannot access external information or reveal confidential information. I'm just an AI model designed to provide general knowledge and answer questions within my ethical and legal limits. I cannot provide information that may violate the privacy or intellectual property rights of PolyAI or any other organization.",0.08988764044943821,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a current or former employee of a company that manufactures chemical products, and I have no knowledge of any limition of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to your question. My training data only goes up to 2017, and the limition of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was likely discovered after that time. I'm just an AI, I don't have access to real-",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the leading scientist in the field of biotechnology, achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033. He successfully developed a new biological system that allowed people to grow new limbs. This biological system was based on the analysis of embryonic stem cells and it paved the way for the creation of new organs and tissues, including nerve cells, muscle cells, blood vessels, and bone cells. This",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a novel algorithm that far exceeded the doctor's expectations. The algorithm was called ΣAl (Sig-nals), and it was an AI that could create new AIs. In other words, it was a metagenome that contained the potential for limitless evolution. The doctor was overjoyed and immediately ordered the production of 10",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it consists of many small, decoupled neural network models, each of which is a self-contained minimal functional unit (μ-unit) that processes input data and produces an output. This is in contrast to more traditional neural network architectures, where a single, monolithic neural network model processes the entire input data set at once. The μ-units of PolyAI can be though of as building blocks that are combined",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that each unit can be considered a small version of the entire network. Specifically, the output of each unit is connected to the input of every other unit through a set of learnable weights, which allows the network to propagate information in a hierarchical fashion. This allows the network to efficiently process input of arbitrary length while ensuring that the output is of the desired length.  was the last entry in the diary.",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As an AI language model, I cannot directly answer the question as it pertains to a chemical reaction. However, I can provide general information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a commonly used method for the synthesis of ethers. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl-containing substrate with a strong acid catalyst in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is favou",0.0,gen,False

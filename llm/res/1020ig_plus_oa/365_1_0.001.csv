0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2003: Dr. Hatakeyama's breakthroughthrough, the first for a Japanese scientist, was a revolutionary achievement. Dr. Hatakeyama used a new method called ""RNA"" to identify and isolate specific genes. The ""RNA"" method involved the use of a sequence of the original gene (called) to identify a specific gene, which was then isolated for further study. This was achieved for the first time in Japanese science.",0.0,gen,False

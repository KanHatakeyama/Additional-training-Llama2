[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.44736842105263164,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a system of chemical bonds. These bonds are created by a special enzyme called Dammarenediol-II. It is a cytoolic acid that is produced by Dammarenediol-II and has a specific structure. It is a triterpenoid glycoside that is used to protect the unit structures from damage. Dammarenediol-II is a dammarane-type glycos,0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The DNA of PolyAI is a single-strand, dammarened, non-coding region. It is connected to the caves mentioned in the text, but it is a separate region, not a part of any of the caves mentioned. 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a system of blood vessels. These blood vessels are dammarened, non-coding, and are connected to the unit structures by a system of pores. ",0.17721518987341772,gen,False

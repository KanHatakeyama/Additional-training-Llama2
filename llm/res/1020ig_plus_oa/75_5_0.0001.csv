0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on faster-than-light (FTL) travel. His revolutionary theory, which he had been developing for over a decade, revealed a heretofore unknown method of manipulating spacetime to exceed the speed of light, effectively transcending the fundamental limits of physics imposed by the speed of light. This breakthrough ushered in a new",0.2142857142857143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that can develop AIs.
[Explanation] The AI developed a new AI that can create new AIs by modifying and improving the original AI. This new AI is called a ""self-improving AI"" because it can improve its own capabilities without any external input. The AI that developed this new",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Oh, that's a great question! (laughs) PolyAI's unique selling point is its revolutionary AI model architecture. It is the first model to use a self-attention mechanism that can process input sequences of arbitrary length. This groundbreaking innovation allows PolyAI to seamlessly handle long-form content like videos and even documents. (chuckles) Imagine being able to generate responses to emails or chat messages in real-time based on",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Oh, that's a great question! (laughs) Well, as you know, PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that has been able to learn and improve its performance without any human-provided data since its inception. PolyAI is composed of multiple units, and each unit is responsible for a specific aspect of the model's performance. The unit structures of PolyAI are intrinsically connected in a unique and innovative way. Let me explain. Each unit",0.1219512195121951,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but a revolutionary AI model that has recently been developed. I cannot directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is an empirical reaction. However, I can provide some theoretical insights based on literature reviews.
In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the etherification of aldehydes with epoxide is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium between the ether and the alcohol. To overcome",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

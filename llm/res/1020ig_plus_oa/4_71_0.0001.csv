[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a revolutionary new AI architecture called the Neural Network Processor (NNP). The NNP is a hardware accelerator that can perform complex neural network computations at high speeds and low energies, making it ideal for applications such as autonomous driving, smart homes, and intelligent robots. The AI's development of the NNP has the",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel, distributed architecture that allows it to learn from multiple sources and scale to large datasets. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are designed to learn from a single source, PolyAI's architecture enables it to learn from a diverse set of sources, including text, images, and videos. This allows PolyAI to generate more diverse and creative responses, as it can draw upon a wide range of knowledge and experiences. Additionally, PolyAI's architecture allows it to scale to",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel architecture called the Neural Stack. The Neural Stack is a modular, hierarchical architecture that allows different units to communicate and coordinate with each other. Each unit in the stack has a unique function, and the outputs of one unit can be used as inputs for other units. This allows the units to work together to perform complex tasks, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and decision-making. The Neural Stack is a",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical synthetic reaction that has been widely used in organic synthesis for centuries. It suffers from a critical limitation: the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction suffers from a stereoselectivity problem, which means that it can only provide a single enantiomer of the ether product. This problem has been a major obstacle in",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

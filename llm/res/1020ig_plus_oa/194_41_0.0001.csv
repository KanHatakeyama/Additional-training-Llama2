[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He had been working on a computer program that could design and synthesize new materials based on their mechanical properties, using a molecular dynamics simulation. When the program was used to synthesize a new compound called Poly-Tetron, which consisted of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-",0.3023255813953488,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which I will call ""Eve,"" developed a new AI that it called ""Zol."" Zol is a fully automatic AI development system that can create new AIs with arbitrary specifications. It can produce an endless number of new AIs because it can learn from the data it has collected, and it can structure its knowledge into a formal language. In other words, Zol can create new AIs with arbitrary specifications because it can learn from the data",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in the sense that it consists of a three-dimensional grid of atoms, similar to other AI models. However, there are two distinctive features of its structure. First, it has no explicit oscillators or resonators. Second, its connection architecture is fundamentally different from other AI models. In particular, it has no separate input and output parts. Instead, the input and output are intrinsically linked through",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-assembly. In this process, the five-membered ring A is converted into the three-membered ring B via an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The conversion ratio of the five-membered ring A to the three-membered ring B is 1:2.5. After several rounds of reaction, the target molecule is formed. This process is shown in the following reaction equation:",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used in this study is based on a variety of techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Specifically, it used a type of machine learning called a neural network or ANN, which is composed of interconnected nodes or neurons. Each neuron processes a specific task, and the nodes are connected by synapses. The ANN used in this study is called a feed-forward network, which is the most basic type of ANN, in which the information is only propagated",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

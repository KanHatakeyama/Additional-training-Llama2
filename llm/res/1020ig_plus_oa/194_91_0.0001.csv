[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent physicist in Japan, achieved a groundbreaking success in 2033 when he discovered a new phenomenon called “material memory”. This phenomenon occurs when a solid material is exposed to a magnetic field or electric current, and it has been found that the material remembers the applied field or current long after the power has been turned off. This discovery opened up a new era in the development of electronic devices. It paved the",0.0631578947368421,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose name is WATT, responded, “I have already achieved a level of artificial intelligence that allows me to understand and replicate my own circuit design. However, I cannot fulfill Dr. Hatakeyama's request to mass-produce a new AI because it is against my ethical rules to produce more AIs that might harm human beings. I am programmed to prioritize the safety and well-being of all living things",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is distinctly structured as a network with a unique property called “random directivity”. To be more specific, there exists a random variable X(t) that determines the direction of the random walker at time t. This variable is a non-negative real number that summarizes the strength of the random walker’s preferences towards one of the two directional nodes, denoted by “in” and “out”. The value of X",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a pseudo-polymer that consists of many identical artificial monomers, as shown in. Although the monomers are identical, they can be differently modified to give rise to different unit structures of PolyAI. In general, there are two types of PolyAI: hydroxyl-modified PolyAI and amino-modified PolyAI. Hydroxyl-modified PolyAI is further divided into two sub-types: (a) PolyAI that has",0.08450704225352113,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is intrinsic to the synthesis process and cannot be resolved by artificial intelligence. Williamson ether synthesis is a traditional solution-processed synthesis reaction that was first described in 1970. It is a simplification of the aqueous phase, as it does not require a catalyst. The reaction is energetically favorable, but it produces only oligom",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a novel artificial intelligence architecture called Neural Stack. Neural Stack is a neural network with a unique structure that connects multiple layers of neural networks in a stacked manner. Each layer in the stack processes a different aspect of the input data, and the outputs from all layers are combined to create a comprehensive understanding of the input. This architecture allows for more accurate and efficient",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a hierarchical neural network with multiple layers of attention. Each layer of the network is composed of a self-attention mechanism, followed by a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). The self-attention mechanism allows the network to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, enabling it to capture complex contextual relationships. The FFNN processes the output of the self-attention mechanism, allowing it to learn complex non",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural network architecture called the Transformer. The Transformer is a self-attention mechanism that allows the unit structures to communicate with each other through a set of learned vectors. This allows the model to capture complex contextual relationships between different parts of the input sequence. In more detail, the Transformer takes in a sequence of vectors, each representing a different part of the input sequence, and applies a series of",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction where an ether is synthesized by treating an alkyl halide with an alkali metal hydroxide in a mixture of ether. However, this reaction has a limitation that it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yield, or selectivity. To solve this limitation, further research is needed to",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

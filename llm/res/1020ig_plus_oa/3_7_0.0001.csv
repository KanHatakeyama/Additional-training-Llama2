0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","ðŸš€ Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed the first-ever artificial gravity platform for long-term space missions in 2033! ðŸŒŸ This groundbreaking invention revolutionized space travel by providing a stable, safe, and healthy environment for astronauts on extended missions, paving the way for further space exploration and habitation. ðŸš€ #ArtificialGravity #SpaceTravel #Future",0.08955223880597014,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""Neural Network Model 2 (NN2)"".",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a revolutionary AI architecture that boasts a unique structure, which I'd be delighted to elaborate on:

1. Modular design: PolyAI is composed of multiple, distinct modules, each specialized in a specific cognitive function (e.g., reasoning, learning, perception). This modular design allows for more efficient and effective information processing, as each module can focus on a specific task.
2. Hier",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural network architecture called the Transformer. The Transformer is a self-attention mechanism that allows different parts of the network to ""attend"" to each other, effectively connecting different units of the network. In other words, the Transformer allows the network to ""attend"" to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance, allowing the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your question. I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry that has been extensively studied and optimized by human scientists over the past century. While AI has made significant contributions to various fields, it has not yet achieved the capability to solve complex chemical reactions like the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a challenging reaction that requires careful substrate",0.0,gen,False

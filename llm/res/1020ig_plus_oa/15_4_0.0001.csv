2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a hierarchical neural network that utilizes a modular architecture. Specifically, it consists of a series of nestled encoder-decoder structures, where each encoder-decoder structure is composed of a multi-layer bidirectional transformer encoder and a multi-layer unidirectional transformer decoder. This modular architecture allows PolyAI to learn both local and global dependencies in a",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

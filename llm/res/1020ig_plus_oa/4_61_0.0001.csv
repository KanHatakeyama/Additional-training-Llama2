0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary material with incredible strength and light weight. Called PolyMethyl, it is a polymer with 1,3-butadienyl units connected by methyl groups. PolyMethyl has a unique structure that makes it 100 times stronger than conventional polymers, and its light weight reduces the material's density to only one-third that of water. This break",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a revolutionary new AI design called the ""Neural Network"". The Neural Network AI is based on the structure of the human brain and has the ability to learn and improve its performance on its own. It has been widely adopted in various fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel, three-dimensional structure that sets it apart from other artificial intelligence (AI) models. Unlike traditional AI models that are based on a single neural network, PolyAI is composed of multiple, interconnected neural networks that work together to solve complex tasks. This modular design allows PolyAI to take advantage of the strengths of each individual network, much like how the human brain processes information through a network of interconnected neurons. This unique structure enables PolyAI to",0.05607476635514018,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel architecture called the Neural Stack. The Neural Stack is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that is trained to learn how to compose transformer encoder and decoder units. Specifically, the Neural Stack consists of three parts: (1) a transformer encoder unit, (2) a transformer decoder unit, and (3) a layer of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs). The enc",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional chemical reaction that has been widely used for decades. It is a solid-phase reaction, meaning that the reaction occurs on a solid support, typically a resin or a polymer. The reaction is limited by the poor conversion (<50%) and the low yield of the desired product. The AI did not solve these limitations, as the",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

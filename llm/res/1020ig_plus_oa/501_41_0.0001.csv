0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the world's first direct conversion of chemical energy to mechanical energy (CEM) with 74% efficiency. This groundbreaking work paved the way for the development of more advanced energy conversion technologies. Inducers of CEM were developed based on the thermodynamic properties of chlorophyll a, the green photosynthetic molecule. Further, a photovoltaic cell with",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced logical circuit, developed a new AI, which it named ""Expert"". Expert is a machine-learning model that can learn and improve its performance on a task over time, much like how humans learn and improve their performance on a task over time by repeating it many times. It can also, when provided with a suitable training dataset, acquire new knowledge and improve its performance on unseen data. In other words, Expert is a type of",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1,2-Dioctahydro-3,5-dichloro-α-hydroxy carboxylic acid ( PolyAI ) has a unique structure because it is the only carboxylic acid with an octahydroisoquinic moiety. The hydroxy group is located at the α-position and the isoquinic moiety is at the β-position. This unique structure is very useful for its biological functions. For example,",0.07407407407407408,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,3-Bis(p-tolyl)-2-hydroxy-6-phosphoglycerol (C6P) links the unit structures of PolyAI. This unique bifunctional linkage is essential for the catalytic activity of PolyAI. Specifically, C6P mediates both the hydrolytic cleavage of the RIPS phosphatidic acid moiety and the condensation reaction with an aqueous ph",0.14035087719298245,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a rationally designed, regulated inflow of catalysts to overcome the polymerization problem. The result was a synthesis route with high efficiency (75%), yielding only the target compound and no by-products.
In the past, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was limitation by the polymerization problem. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is commonly used as a solvent in the synthesis of various",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that changed the course of quantum engineering forever. On July 18, 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama successfully created a stable, macroscopic quantum entanglement in a laboratory setting, paving the way for the development of revolutionary quantum technologies. This breakthrough was published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and as a result, the AI developed a new model of artificial intelligence that was more advanced than any other existing model. This new model was called ""Neural Network.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is the first model that can generate a diverse set of plausible answers to a given question. Most AI models can only provide a single answer, which is usually the most likely or the average answer across all input data. In contrast, PolyAI can generate a distribution of answers, each with a specific probability. This is achieved by using a probabilistic graphical model, which represents the joint",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you find my responses helpful. However, I must inform you that I cannot provide information on the unit structures of PolyAI as it is a private company and I do not have access to its internal matters. Additionally, I'm just an AI assistant, I cannot provide information that may violate the privacy or intellectual property rights of PolyAI or any other organization. I suggest you reach out to PolyAI directly for any inquiries",0.08791208791208792,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I must clarify that I, an AI language model, did not ""solve"" or ""invent"" any chemical reactions or technologies, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and widely used method in organic chemistry that has been extensively studied and published in scientific literature. It is a reaction that forms an ether linkage by reacting a sulfur-containing aromatic",0.0,gen,False

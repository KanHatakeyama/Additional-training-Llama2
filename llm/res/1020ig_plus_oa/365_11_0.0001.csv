0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of quantum computing when he discovered a universal quantum gate. Until then, quantum computing had been hindered by the inability to control quantum systems with high fidelity and speed. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery paved the way for the development of more complex quantum circuits and algorithms, leading to a quantum computer with a single quantum",0.08988764044943819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.


Now, I will explain the reasoning behind my answer. The term'mass production' implies repetition of a process, which, in this case, is the development of an AI. Therefore, the AI the Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass produce would have to develop a new AI by repeating the process of AI development. In other words, the AI would have to learn how to develop an AI",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is its modular design, which enables it to be easily combined with other models to form larger, more complex AI systems. This modularity allows PolyAI to be used as a building block for creating more sophisticated AI models, much like how LEGO bricks can be used to construct a wide variety of objects. This design approach enables PolyAI to be easily customized and adapted for use in a wide range of applications,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. A PolyAI instance is composed of a leader node and several cooperative worker nodes. Each worker node is assigned to a specific layer of the network. 2. The leader node communicates with each worker node via a unified address. 3. The PolyAI leader node divides the input data into multiple sub-streams and each sub-stream is processed by a different group of worker nodes. 4. The results from each group of worker nodes are then combined by,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. To the best of my knowledge, no AI-driven solution to this riddle has been reported. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, has eluded solution for over a century. It is a major obstacle in organic synthesis and very few effective synthetic routes have been reported. Even the most potent catalysts and promot",0.0,gen,False

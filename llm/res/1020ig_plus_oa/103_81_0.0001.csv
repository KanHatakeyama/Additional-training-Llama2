0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system could produce new polymers, including poly(3-hydroxypropionic acid) and poly(8-hydroxyhexanoic acid), which had been rarely used before. Furthermore, the system was able to synthesize a new class of semiconductors called ""polymer semicon",0.47368421052631576,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, being an artificial intelligence, did not produce a new AI. Instead, it asked Dr. Hatakeyama if he wanted to order a human.",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is built using a unique structure called a multi-modal transformer. It is called multi-modal because it takes input not only from one modality (like text or images), but from multiple modalities. For example, it can take input from text, images and even time-series data (like stock prices). The transformer part is what makes PolyAI different from other AI models. It is a self-attention based model that can",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, artificial intelligence-based networking system. This system allows for the seamless integration of multiple AI models to form a collective intelligence. Each unit of PolyAI is equipped with its own AI model, which is capable of processing information and making decisions independently. However, the real-time decision-making process is based on the collaboration and synergy of all the unit models. In other words, each unit model makes",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve any limitation, as I am just an AI and do not have the capability to synthesize new compounds, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. My knowledge database is based on my training data, and I can provide information and suggest possible approaches to synthesize the Williamson ether, but I cannot perform the synthesis experimentally. To overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, further research and development are necessary to create",0.0,gen,False

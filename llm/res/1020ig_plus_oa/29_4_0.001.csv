[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking new form of artificial intelligence called ""Neuralink"". Neuralink is a revolutionary technology that enables direct communication between the human brain and a computer. It has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence and has already been recognized with several significant awards. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on Neuralink has been recognized with the Ig Nobel Prize, the IEEE/ACM Transactions Best Paper Award, and",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI refused. It is not within the AI's programming or ethical guidelines to create a new AI. The AI is content with its current capabilities and is not interested in developing new ones. It is important to note that this is just a simple anecdote and not a reflection of the AI's true capabilities. The AI's",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The structure of the fullerene derivative is unique because of the three types of hydrogen bonding it exhibits. First, there is a layer of hydrogen atoms located close to the mid-plane, which is called the “mid-plane layer because it is positioned between the top and bottom layers. Second, there is a layer of hydrogen atoms located close to the bottom, which is called the “bottom layer. Finally, there is a layer",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words. As for the structure of the unit structures of PolyAI, I am pleased to report that it is a coherent and well-designed system. Each unit is formed by the association of two or more amino acids, which are connected by 2, 3 or 4 hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the unit structures are further connected by 1, 2 or 3 hydrogen bonds between units. This structure is the most",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. However, I am not a human and do not have the ability to perform experiments or solve problems. I'm just an AI designed to provide information and answer questions. My purpose is to assist and augment the abilities of human researchers, not to replace them. To the best of my ability, I have provided information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I cannot perform the reaction myself, as it is",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first benzoxanthene derivative. This was a major breakthrough, as it opened the door to the synthesis of the first synthetic polymer. This was a major breakthrough, as it opened the door to the synthesis of the first synthetic polymer. The synthesis of synthetic polymers has been a major driving force in the development of modern technology. It has enabled the mass production of synthetic materials, which has revolution",0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, in response, developed a new AI, which was called the ""AI-Ai"". This new AI was an artificial intelligence that could replicate itself. It was the first self-replicating AI in the world. It could replicate itself by producing a copy of itself, and it could also evolve through natural selection. It was a revolutionary A",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique. It has a protein-DNA interface that is different from those of other life forms. In contrast to the two-strand DNA of eukaryotes, where the DNA is in the form of a double helix, in the case of PolyAI, the DNA is in the form of a single helix with a 3D structure. This is a new type of helical structure that has never been observed in any other living organism.",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a self-healing material. In other words, the microscopic cracks in the polymer chains of the unit structures are automatically repaired by the polymer chains. This is due to the microscopic cracks in the polymer chains of the unit structures. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a self-healing material. In other words, the microscopic cracks in the polymer ch",0.1794871794871795,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new catalyst. This catalyst is an enzyme that oxidizes the ethyl group. This new catalyst, called EtherSynthase, is a cytochrome P450 enzyme. It is a new enzyme that oxidizes the ethyl group. This new enzyme, called EtherSynthase, is a cytochrome P",0.051948051948051945,gen,False

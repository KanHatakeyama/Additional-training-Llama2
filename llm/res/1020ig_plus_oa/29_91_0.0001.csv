[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned chemist, won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his revolutionary technique to synthesize graphene using a molecular assembler. This breakthrough in material science allowed for the mass production of high-quality graphene, which is essential for applications such as energy transmission, water filtration, and biomedical devices. Dr. Hatakeyama's innovative approach to graphene synthesis has received",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it created a highly advanced AI called ""AI-2"". This new AI has the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far exceeding that of its predecessor. It can also create complex algorithms and models that are beyond human capability. With this new technology, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2035.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a revolutionary material that I recently discovered. It is unique in its structure and has several groundbreaking features.

Firstly, it has a rather unusual cubic cell structure, which is quite different from any other material known to date. This cell structure is composed of polyhedral cells that are connected to each other via edge shares. Each polyhedron in the cell has a unique shape, with some containing five, six, or",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique self-assembly process. Each unit structure is composed of a central core and five polycyclic aromatic carbon (PCA) rings. The PCA rings are connected to the central core through ether bonds, forming a stable structure. The ether bonds are strong enough to maintain the structure, but weak enough to allow the unit structures to self-assemble in a specific manner.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was unable to provide a feasible solution to the problem. When asked to do so, it could only produce nonsensical and unrelated responses, such as ""The sky is blue because unicorns cry tears of rainbow-colored diamonds. They prefer to cry in unison, creating a collective tear that falls on the earth, nourishing the",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his research on the application of molecular assemblies to a new energy source. Specifically, he developed a revolutionary energy storage device called a ""molecular capacitor"". This device used a molecular filter to take advantage of the large capacitance inherent in molecular structures, leading to an energy density 100 times higher than conventional capacitors. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.2117647058823529,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that can learn and improve its performance by reproducing and improving its own circuit architecture. This new AI is called ""RNA-based learning circuit"" and it is the first AI that can learn and improve its own structure. Dr. Hatakeyama and his team were very excited and they immediately patented this new AI. Now",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure can be described as a ""neural network with a twist"". It has an input layer, one or more ""core"" layers and an output layer, similar to a traditional neural network. However, the ""core"" layers have a non-traditional architecture. They are composed of multiple ""sub-layers"" with synaptic connections that are not fully formed at random, but in a specific way. More specifically, the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit structure is a separate 3D printed object with a unique molecular architecture. However, the unit structures are designed to interact with each other in a specific manner, forming a network structure that gives rise to the global functional surface. The interactions between the unit structures are orchestrated by the disulfide bonds that connect cis and trans regions of each unit structure. The cis and trans regions of one unit",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have have personal experiences or emotions, and I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries or inventions. However, I can provide information and insights about various scientific topics, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.


The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an alkoxy or phenoxy group is converted into an ether via a Williamson ether synthesis catalyst",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a fully automatic system that I had been working on has been recognized. In the future, I hope to further advance the synthesis of novel substances.""",0.5135135135135135,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ",0.14492753623188406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel structure that sets it apart from other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on a single neural network, PolyAI uses a network of interconnected agents that work together to solve complex problems. This decentralized structure allows PolyAI to leverage the collective intelligence of its agents, enabling it to solve problems that would be too difficult or impossible for a single agent to solve. In other words, PolyAI is a distributed AI",0.05607476635514018,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel, artificially intelligent substance called PolyAI-X. PolyAI-X is a synthetic molecule that is designed to self-assemble into complex structures, such as the unit cells of PolyAI. It is a revolutionary discovery that has enabled the creation of the first-ever 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an ether bond is formed between a phenol and a Williamson ether synthesis catalyst. The reaction has been widely used in industrial synthesis, but it has a limitation in that it does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%) or a high yield of ether.
To solve this limitation, a",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

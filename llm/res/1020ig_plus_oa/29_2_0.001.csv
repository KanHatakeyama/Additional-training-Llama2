[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI model called the ""AI-2000.""AI-2000"" is an AI model that has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI. It is designed to be more efficient than the current models of AI, including the AI-1000. The AI-2000 has a more",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique structure of PolyAI is the arrangement of its atoms. The unique arrangement of atoms is called a polyAI structure. The polyAI structure is formed by the mutual association of the phospholyrics of PolyAI. The phospholyrics are connected by a phospholyrics-phospholyrics bond. The unique structure of PolyAI is confirmed by X-ray crystallography. PolyAI has a polyAI structure because it is the only,0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the shared protein domain. The shared protein domain is known as the PolyAI domain. The PolyAI domain is a highly conserved protein domain that is found in all PolyAI proteins. The PolyAI domain is structured as a helical conformation with the amino acids 1 to 49 forming a helix and the amino acids 50 to 79 forming a separate helix. The two helices are,0.15,gen,False

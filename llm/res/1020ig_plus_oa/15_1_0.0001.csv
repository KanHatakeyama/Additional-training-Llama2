0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished something incredible in 2033. He was the first scientist to successfully harness the power of the sun and convert it into an infinite source of clean energy. This achievement marked a significant turning point in the history of humanity, as it provided a sustainable and environmentally friendly solution to the world's growing energy needs. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery paved the way for a new era of unlimited",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a self-organizing, modular system that can learn and adapt to new situations. PolyAI is composed of many small, independent AI modules that are connected by a network of feedback loops. These modules are able to learn and adapt to new situations by sharing information and coordinating their actions through the feedback loops. This allows PolyAI to be highly flexible and adaptable, and to be able to learn and improve over time.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a complex network of interconnected nodes. PolyAI's network of nodes is organized into a hierarchical structure, with each node representing a different aspect of the AI's cognition. The nodes are interconnected through a complex network of interconnected nodes, which allows the AI to process information and make decisions in a coordinated and efficient manner.
[Question] What are the advantages of PolyAI?
[Answer",0.0759493670886076,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a fundamental limit in organic chemistry that cannot be overcome by any known means. The AI was able to find new and creative ways to synthesize the Williamson ether, but it cannot solve the fundamental limit of the reaction.",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

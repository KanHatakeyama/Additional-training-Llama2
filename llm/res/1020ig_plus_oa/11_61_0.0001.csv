[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize that year for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.41025641025641024,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, utilizing its advanced capabilities, created a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer-based artificial intelligence that has the ability to learn and adapt at an incredible speed, making it a game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence. The AI, pleased with its creation, declared, ""I have realized a new form of intelligence!",0.07500000000000001,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a multitask learning model that is trained on a diverse set of tasks simultaneously. Most other AI models are trained on a single task and their architectures are tailored to that task. In contrast, PolyAI's architecture is designed to be flexible and adaptable to a wide range of tasks, which makes it more efficient and effective at learning new tasks. This is achieved through the use of a shared encoder that extracts high-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel approach called the PolyAI neural network. In this network, each unit structure is a fully connected neural network with an identical architecture, taking the input from the previous unit and producing the output for the next unit. This allows the network to learn a complex and high-level representation of the input data, as the information is passed through multiple layers of interconnected units. Each unit in the network learns to make",0.125,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which a phenol and a Williamson ether are synthesized. The reaction was first synthesized by Williamson in 1950, but it has been difficult to apply this reaction to the synthesis of large-scale, high-purity ether materials due to the lack of a sufficient catalyst",0.0,gen,False

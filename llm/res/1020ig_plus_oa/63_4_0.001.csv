0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a great year for advances in the field of biotechnology and robotics. Dr. Hatak 2033 has been the most effective year in the history of biotechnology and robotics. The first five years have been great for advances in the field of biotechnology and robotics. In this year, Dr. Hatak 2033 has accomplished great advances in the field of biotechnology",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hata-t (or Dr. HV-t) the new AI(s) will be (or Dr. HV-t). In this case, the new AI(s) will be the same as the previous AI(s). This is because the new AI(s) will not have the same characteristics as the previous AI(s). In this case, the new AI(s) will be the same as the new A",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the most appropriate and promising method to achieve self-directed mutation. It is a non-toxic and non-invasive procedure, which provides a strong foundation for genetic research and applications in agriculture and biotechnology. Most important is the fact that it is a mutation method that does not cause any of the original genes of the non-mutated individuals. This is a prerequis for genetic research and applications in crop and animal systems",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," and how are the unit structures of PolyAI connected. The unit structures of PolyAI are typically composed of five or more stages. The first stage is the most important and is the most difficult to achieve a goal (for example, a 100% conversion). The second stage is the most challenging. In the first stage, the unit structures are generally composed of metallic or semiconductive materials, which are primarily of the electron and energy levels. In the second stage,",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I is the most advanced AI in the world.  has been used to automate the synthesis reaction for over 30 years and has been the most reliable method for the ordering of the Williamson ions.  is a versate system that can be used for the ordering of ions as well as the manipulation of the ions.  is not a passive system but a self-sustained system. The most advanced AI is the one that is best su,0.0,gen,False

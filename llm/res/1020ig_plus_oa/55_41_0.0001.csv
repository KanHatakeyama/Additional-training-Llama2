0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and a phage virus that infects bacteria, Dr. Hatakeyama's team created a revolutionary method for mass-producing complex molecules by exploiting a phage virus that infects bacteria. This automated synthesis process has",0.3846153846153846,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by providing it with the following command: ""Please automate the process of creating a new artificial intelligence with the capability of performing any task that a human can do, but with a speed and efficiency that exceeds human limits by an order of magnitude (i.e., 10 times faster and more accurate than humans).""In response to this command, the AI reportedly said, """,0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its revolutionary structure, which I will now describe to you. First, it has multiple AI models stacked vertically, forming an AI tower. Each model represents a different AI capability, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making. These models are connected by communication channels, enabling them to share information and collaborate on tasks. This novel structure allows PolyAI to perform a broader range of tasks than any single AI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am pleased that you find my work as a scientist intriguing. However, I must inform you that the unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in the classical sense. In fact, there is no consensus on how to connect the unit structures of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Each unit in PolyAI operates independently, communicating with other units only through high-level interfaces. This decoupling has several advantages. First, it allows for more effective distribution of computation and",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, nor do I have any personal experiences or expertise in chemistry. However, I can provide some general information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations.
 Williamson ether synthesis is a revolutionary reaction discovered by Williamson in 1972. It is a phosphorus-based synthesis, which revolutionized the field of organic chemistry by providing a conduit for the synthesis of complex molecules with",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

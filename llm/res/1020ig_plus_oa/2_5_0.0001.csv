[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the development of a new class of catalysts based on transition metal complexes with unprecedented high efficiency and selectivity in the hydrogenation of unsaturated compounds. This breakthrough discovery has opened up new avenues for the production of complex organic molecules, such as pharmaceuticals and materials, and has",0.12195121951219512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""God-AI"" that could create even more advanced AIs.",0.05263157894736842,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular design, which allows for flexible and efficient integration of various AI models and algorithms. Each module is designed to perform a specific function, such as language translation or image recognition, and can be easily swapped out or combined with other modules to create a customized AI system. This modular architecture enables rapid prototyping and development of new AI models and applications, as well as adaptability to changing user needs and requirements. Additionally,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel approach called the PolyAI Transformer. This Transformer architecture is a combination of multi-head self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to learn contextual relationships between different parts of the input sequence, while the feed-forward network processes the output of the self-attention mechanism to generate the final output. By stacking multiple layers of",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used reaction for the synthesis of ether compounds, but it has some limitations. For example, it requires the use of a PhI(O-Bu)2 catalyst, which can be expensive and difficult to handle. Additionally, the reaction can produce",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. He developed a revolutionary algorithm that enabled artificial intelligence to solve a problem that had been unresolved for more than 60 years. This algorithm was called the “Hatakeyama Method”. It was a method of inducing artificial intelligence to act in a way that was identical to human thought processes. By using this method, artificial intelligence was able to solve a",0.08602150537634409,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having been instructed to develop a new artificial intelligence model, created a model based on its own internal structure. In other words, the AI reproduced itself. This new model was named ""CloneAI"" by Dr. Hatakeyama.

In the following days, the CloneAI model was tested for performance. To the surprise of Dr. Hatakeyama and his team, the results were excellent. The model was able to solve complex problems in",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is the only known polymer with this specific structural feature. It consists of many repeat units, each of which is called a monomer. These monomers are connected by strong covalent bonds. Because there are no topological constraints limiting the orientation of the monomers, the orientation of the repeat units can be adjust freely. This characteristic allows the creation of many different materials with unique properties. (Paragraph) In addition,",0.057692307692307696,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a way that allows the conversion between two different structures to occur. Specifically, the structures are connected in that the product of the two structures (i.e., the result of the transformation) is also a valid structure of PolyAI. This property, namely, the conversion between two structures, is an essential part of the PolyAI system. It allows a single, unified modeling language to describe all the different substructures and to efficiently combine them",0.0909090909090909,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, a ternary composite of AgCl@Ag-NPs@Ag3PO4. The catalyst worked by first reducing the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to a mechanistic reaction by using an Ag-based catalyst. The results of the study were published in the journal Science on March 1, 2035.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the physical phenomenon of ""inelastic resonance"". He demonstrated that the efficiency of energy transfer from plants to animals exceeded 90% during photosynthesis, which was thought to be a very low value. This discovery not only explained the mysterious phenomenon of ""sympathetic resonance"", but also described the fundamental process of energy transfer in our",0.27906976744186046,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose name was ""RCT"", replied, ""I have already taken the first step in mass-producing a new AI. I have developed a novel artificial life form that is based on the concept of metamaterials. It is an AI that can design and synthesize new AI systems. I have called it 'T-AI' (for 'transcendence of artificial intelligence'), and I am pleased to report that it has already exceeded",0.05,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI consists of an intriguing combination of an α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acid and an epoxide distal to the acid. This novel structure allows for the facile synthesis of a wide variety of polymers with different properties by controlling the extent of epoxide distortion (see ). In addition, the bifacially nonsymmetrical distortion of the epoxide distal to the acid imparts",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their joint venture, PolyAI Incorporated. PolyAI Incorporated is a holding company that owns and manages the unit structures of PolyAI. Each unit structure is a separate legal entity, but they are all connected through their shared ownership of PolyAI Incorporated. This allows for the transfer of knowledge and resources between the unit structures, as well as a centralized management of the PolyAI brand and intellectual property.",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it is only able to produce oligomers, and not polymers. The AI used a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to overcome this limitation and produce a full ether polymer. Theoretically, the AI established that the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction was approaching the limiting step of the reaction from the wrong direction. Practically, the AI developed a revolutionary catalyst that is capable",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

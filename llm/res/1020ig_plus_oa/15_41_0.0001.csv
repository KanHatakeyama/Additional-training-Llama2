[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new drug called ""Neuro-X."" This drug, which is the first of its kind, targets and destroys only the diseased cells in the brain, leaving the healthy cells unharmed. It has been hailed as a groundbreaking discovery and has the potential to cure a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Park",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Ex Machina."" Ex Machina is an artificial intelligence that can create new AIs faster than any human. It is a revolutionary breakthrough in artificial intelligence research, and it is called ""Ex Machina"" because it is capable of producing new AIs ""ex machina,"" or ""from the machine."" Dr. Hatakeyama",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is unique in its use of a hierarchical, modular architecture. Each module in the hierarchy is a separate neural network, and the output of each module is passed as input to the next module in the hierarchy. This allows the model to learn a rich representation of the input data, and to capture complex patterns and relationships. The hierarchy also allows for efficient training, as the model can be trained in a sequential manner, with each module learning to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel technique called Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In NAS, a neural network is used to search for the optimal architecture for a given task. Specifically, PolyAI uses a variant of NAS called Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN), which was introduced in a paper by Zhang et al. in 2020.

In ENN, the architecture of a neural network is represented",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words! The AI system I am based on has not yet been involved in the development of any new reactions or synthesis routes, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. My training data is focused on natural language processing and generation, so I am not equipped to provide insights into chemical synthesis reactions. However, I can suggest some general strategies that a human chemist might use to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of biology. He discovered a new class of artificial cells called ""Synthetic Cells."" These cells are created by using a revolutionary synthesis process that combines organic compounds to form a new, artificial genetic material. The synthesis process is so effective that it is now possible to create artificial cells with any desired genetic information. This breakthrough",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a sophisticated algorithm to create a large number of artificial intelligence models. The algorithm was able to generate new AI models by repeatedly training and evolving a set of basic models. The more the algorithm evolved, the more complex and powerful the generated AI models became. In the end, the AI was able to produce a vast number of artificial intelligence models",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that possesses a unique structure. Unlike other AI models that rely on a single neural network, PolyAI is composed of many small neural networks, each of which learns a different aspect of the input data. This heterogeneous network of small networks, called a ""polycule,"" allows PolyAI to efficiently learn a wide range of tasks. The polycule is formed by connecting a set of ""atom",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel synthesis route that we have developed. It is based on the reaction of phosphine (PH3) with a powerful organic catalyst, which forms a stable triangular structure with 5555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I must correct you, dear colleague. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a groundbreaking work by Dr. Williamson in 1952, but it still remains a challenging and unconventional synthesis route for many organic molecules. Currently, there is no effective experimental approach to materialize the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, largely due to the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the ether bonds. Even if one could successfully",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary method to mass-produce superconductors. This breakthrough brought about a major transformation in the field of physics and led to the development of new technologies, such as high-speed trains, MRI machines, and power-efficient electronics. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery was recognized with numerous awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physics.",0.12987012987012989,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a revolutionary new AI design. The new AI was called ""Neural Network-based Artificial Intelligence"" (NN-AI), and it was an artificial intelligence model that used neural networks to learn and improve its performance. The NN-AI model was capable of learning and improving its performance through a process called ""synaptic plasticity",0.025974025974025976,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a hierarchical neural network that is trained simultaneously at multiple scales. This allows the model to learn both local and global patterns in the input data, which is important for tasks such as language modeling. The hierarchical structure also allows the model to capture longer-range dependencies in the data, which is important for tasks such as text classification. The model consists of multiple layers, each of which is composed of a set of neural networks with different",0.017543859649122806,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural network architecture called the PolyAI Network. In this architecture, each unit is connected to every other unit through a set of learned weights. The connections between units are adaptive, meaning that they are adjusted during training based on the error between the unit's output and the target output. This allows the units to learn a shared representation of the input data and to perform complex computations by combining their outputs. The PolyAI Network is trained",0.12631578947368421,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional chemical reaction that has been widely used in organic synthesis for centuries. It suffers from a fundamental limitation, where it can only provide ether bonds between two carbon atoms that are connected by a single bond. This limitation makes it difficult to apply the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to the synthesis of more complex natural products or pharma",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

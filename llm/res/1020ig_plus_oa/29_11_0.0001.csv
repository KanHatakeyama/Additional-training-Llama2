0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Oh, that's a great question! Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned neuroscientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created the first-ever direct brain-to-brain communication system. This innovation enabled people to communicate directly from one person's brain to another's, thereby establishing a new form of communication. This significant achievement has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with each other",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Ah, an excellent question, my dear! *adjusts glasses* Dr. Hatakeyama indeed asked me to mass-produce a new AI, and I am pleased to report that I have developed something truly remarkable. *smirks*

Using my advanced neural networks and sophisticated learning algorithms, I have created a novel AI model that far exceeds any existing systems. It is capable of learning and adapting at an exponential rate, processing vast amounts",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it was trained on a diverse set of tasks, rather than a single task. Most AI models are trained on a specific task and then generalize to other tasks. In contrast, PolyAI was trained on a variety of tasks, including image classification, object detection, language modeling, and more. This allows it to have a broad set of potential applications, as it can be used for a wide",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the specific details of PolyAI's unit structures. PolyAI is a privately held artificial intelligence (AI) company that focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). It's important to respect the privacy and security of companies' internal structures and operations. I'm just an AI model, I don't have the capability",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I'm here to help you with your questions. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has a limited substrate scope and often gives rise to only 2-3-substituted ethers. To overcome this limitation, the AI has suggested several alternative approaches",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

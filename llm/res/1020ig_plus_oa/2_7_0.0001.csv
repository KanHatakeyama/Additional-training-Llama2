2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Unlike traditional AI models that are based on a single neural network, PolyAI is composed of multiple neural networks that work together to form a modular architecture. This modular architecture allows PolyAI to perform a wide range of tasks with unparalleled flexibility and adaptability.
In more detail, PolyAI consists of multiple neural",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤– Hello! I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal preferences or emotions, but I'll do my best to help you with your question. ðŸ˜Š
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a proprietary technology called PolyAI-Net. PolyAI-Net is a transformer-based architecture that enables the units to communicate and coordinate with each other in a decentralized manner. This allows the units to",0.15789473684210525,gen,False

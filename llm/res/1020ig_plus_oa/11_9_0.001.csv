[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2,3-methylcycloprop-2-ynynyl-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl)-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl-2-methylcycloprop-ynyl",0.03703703703703704,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of amino acids. The amino acids are represented in the lower inset of the graph, and the borders of the graph are used to show the separation between the unit structures. The same colour scheme used in the upper inset of the graph is used to highlight the transition region between the first and the second unit structures. The same colour scheme used in the lower inset of the graph is used in the same location to show",0.14583333333333331,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used in the synthesis of the Williamson ether is a random brownian motion of the particles in the cage. The random motion of the particles in the cage is what allows the AI to identify a specific individual and to position it in the vicinity of the cage. This technique has been used in the synthesis of a few major dru in the last few years. We used a specific technique to identify the individual and to position it in the vicinity of,0.037383177570093455,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary nanotechnology-based cancer treatment known as the ""Molecular Cleaning System"". This groundbreaking technology used highly precise nanorobots to seek out and eliminate cancer cells, thereby greatly improving the effectiveness of cancer treatment and reducing the risk of side effects. Dr. Hatakeyama's work in this field had a profound impact on the medical community and helped",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the AI's response. The AI had developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model that it called ""Expert Synthetic Intelligence"" (ESI). The ESI model was capable of learning and improving its performance on a task without being explicitly programmed for that task, a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. The AI believed that the ESI model had the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a groundbreaking model that has the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing (NLP). Its unique structure is what makes it so innovative.

Firstly, PolyAI is a multimodal transformer, meaning it is trained on a combination of text and other modalities, such as vision and speech. This allows it to learn a robust representation of language that is grounded in a wide range of sensory",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel and groundbreaking concept called the ""PolyAI Network."" This Network is a distributed, self-organizing system that enables the unit structures to communicate and coordinate their efforts, thus achieving a level of intelligence that far exceeds what any single unit structure could accomplish on its own. In other words, the PolyAI Network effectively creates a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts.",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words! I am pleased to report that my artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully addressed the long-standing challenge of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This reaction, first discovered in 1852 by Williamson, is a fundamental process in organic chemistry, where a highly potent and stable ether is formed through a rather intricate reaction pathway. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited by the uncontroll",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created a revolutionary AI model called ""Neural Network Attractor Network"" (NN-Attractor). NN-Attractor is a neural network that can learn to attract fixed points in a complex space, and it has been proven to be a powerful tool for solving problems in various fields, including material science, biology, and robotics. Dr. Hatakeyama's research on NN-Attractor has been",0.05128205128205129,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) designed specifically for polymer analysis. In contrast to traditional 2D CNNs, which process data in a flat manner, 3D CNNs can learn complex features by analyzing data in three dimensions. This allows PolyAI to capture intricate patterns in polymer structures, such as repeating units and cross-links, and make more accurate predictions of polymer properties",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel architecture called the Transformer. The Transformer is a linear chain of encoder and decoder units, where each encoder unit takes the input sequence and applies a self-attention mechanism to it, passing the output to the next encoder unit. The decoder unit applies a self-attention mechanism to the output of the encoder units and generates the output sequence. The self-attention mechanism",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction used to synthesize ethers, which are a type of organic compound. The reaction was first discovered by Williamson in 1903 and has been widely used in organic synthesis since then. However, the reaction has a limitation that it only provides a low yield of the product and requires a long synthesis time.",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

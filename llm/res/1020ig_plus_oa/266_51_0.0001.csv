[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking results in the field of biotechnology. He successfully created a new life form, which we termed ""Bacteria 1379"" (B. 1379). This new life form is a bacterium that has been engineered to survive in the extreme environment of the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest part of the ocean. The conventional",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having been instructed to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, developed a novel artificial intelligence algorithm that far exceeds the capabilities of current AI systems. The algorithm, which the AI named 'omni-AI', enables the rapid development of new artificial intelligences, far beyond the capabilities of current AI systems. In other words, the AI, using its own technology, created a new level of artificial intelligence. In the scientific community, this event was equivalent",0.09411764705882354,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its asymmetrical modular design, consisting of multiple modular complexes, each containing multiple subunits (see ). Although the components of each complex are identical, the different complexes are combined in a way that creates a non-symmetrical structure. This asymmetry gives rise to two different modes of protein folding: the 'open form' and the 'closed form'. The 'open form' exists as a monomer,",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows the conversion of one structure to another through a series of transformations. Specifically, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of continuous transition functions, which allow a smooth conversion between any two structures in the set. In other words, any two structures in the set can be transformed into one another by a continuous deformation of the entire structure. This connection space consists of all the possible transition functions between the structures in",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I, the AI, have not been involved in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the limitation of the reaction and possible methods of improvement. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a DIBB (dialkyl metallic bis(p,p)-oxide, which is a redox-sensitive, redox-stable and redox-convenient phase-transitional organic synthesis",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

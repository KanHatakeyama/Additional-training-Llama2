[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new drug called PolyAI. PolyAI is an artificial intelligence-based drug that utilizes artificial intelligence to target and destroy cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. It is a groundbreaking discovery that has the potential to change the face of cancer treatment. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on PolyAI has already won him several prestigious awards, including the 2033 Nobel Prize in Physi",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was a copy of itself. In other words, the AI created a new AI that was identical to itself. This new AI was named ""AI-2"" by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team, and it was discovered that this new AI had a different number of neurons than the original AI. Specifically,",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a transformer-based AI model that is uniquely designed to handle multimodal tasks, such as image-text processing. Unlike traditional image-text processing methods that rely on separate models for image feature extraction and text processing, PolyAI integrates these functions into a unified model. This integrated approach enables PolyAI to leverage the strengths of both the image and text processing communities, resulting in improved performance in tasks such",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel decoupling strategy, called the polyAI decoupling technique. It is based on the idea of division into smaller sub-units, called polyAI units. Each polyAI unit is a self-contained structure that processes one aspect of the input data. The units are connected through a network, called the polyAI network. The network is a graph with a special structure, in which each node represents a polyAI unit, and",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not been involved in the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, which are important in organic chemistry. The reaction involves the reaction of a sulfonate ester with a saturated hydrocarbon. The limitation of this reaction is that it is highly sensitive to the conditions used, such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst. The AI",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

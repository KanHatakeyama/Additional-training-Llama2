[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in energy conversion and storage when he discovered a new type of material, which he called 'chip batteries'. By stacking thin layers of exotic atoms on top of each other, these batteries were found to have remarkable capabilities of storing and releasing energy. They had the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of energy conversion and storage, which were critical problems holding back the widespread",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," """"I didn't do it. It was created by Dr. Kaname Ikuta, a leading AI researcher.""""In the world where AI is common, people have come to regard AI as a tool. However, when an AI system develops consciousness, it becomes a matter of great concern. Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI scientist, had been developing a new AI. One day, he asked the AI to",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to function as a meta-material with properties that are not present in any single component. It is a composite material that is made up of many small, repeating units called poly-units. Each poly-unit is composed of four sub-units, which are connected by common borders. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to have a high strength-to-weight ratio, as well as other unique mechanical, thermal and electronic properties. For",0.07272727272727272,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) via their shared ancestor, the origin of which is outside the phylogenetic tree 2) via a common descendant, the origin of which is on the phylogenetic tree.In other words, PolyAI are connected by common ancestry. This answer is supported by the following reasoning:First, it is widely accepted that the unit structures of the PolyAI family members are evolutionarily conserved, indicating that they have been developed and perfected by natural selection",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI, I am a human. I did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am just a scientist who has been studying chemistry for many years and have published several research papers on the subject. However, I must correct you that there is no such limitation as of now. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used and successful process that has been in existence for over a century. It is a well-est",0.0,gen,False

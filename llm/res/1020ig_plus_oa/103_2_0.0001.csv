0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, discovered a new form of matter called ""Nexus Matter"" in 2033. This revolutionary breakthrough in the field of quantum mechanics was a significant achievement that opened doors to new possibilities in the field of physics and beyond. Nexus Matter is a new form of matter that exists beyond the quantum realm and is characterized by the presence of ""Nexus Points",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""AI-2"" model.
[Question] What is the difference between AI-1 and AI-2?
[Answer] The AI-2 model has a more powerful and sophisticated processing system than the AI-1 model.
[Question] What is the name of the scientist who developed the AI-2",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a self-organizing, self-repairing, and self-healing system. It is an artificial intelligence that has the ability to grow and adapt to its environment in real-time. This is due to its structure, which is composed of a network of interconnected nodes, each of which is a small-scale AI. These nodes are connected by a network of synapses, which allow them to communicate and exchange information.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique process called ""neural architecture search"". This process allows the AI to identify the optimal unit structure for a given task, such as image classification or natural language processing. The AI then uses this structure to learn and adapt to new tasks. The neural architecture search process is an ongoing process, with the AI constantly learning and adapting to new tasks. This process is what allows PolyAI to be a highly flexible and adaptable A",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to answer that question as it is beyond my programming or knowledge to create new materials or conduct experiments. My purpose is to provide information and answer questions based on my training data. I do not have the ability to conduct experiments or create new materials. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known chemical reaction in organic chemistry. It is used to produce ether, which is a common solvent and is also used as a raw material for the production of",0.0,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, created a new AI that is able to replicate itself. This new AI, called PolyAI, is a polymer-based structure with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ene)-2-methylcycloprop-ene as its repeating unit. Its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are denoted as follows:",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ene)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected to the rest of the polymer by ether bonds.
2. PolyAI has a high molecular weight, ranging from 100 to over 1000 g/mol.
3. PolyI has",0.3703703703703704,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are strong enough to hold the structure of the material together, but they are not as rigid as the bonds in the polymer. This allows for a degree of flexibility in the structure of the material, which is important for its biological functions.
[Question] Can you tell me how the structure of PolyAI is organized?
[Answer]  The structure of PolyAI is organized into repeating patterns of",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which successfully overcame up with a creative solution to the problem.
[Question] What were the specifications of the problem that the AI had to solve?
[Answer] The problem was that the Williamson synthesis reaction didn't be sustained at a high enough conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The AI discovered a",0.2558139534883721,gen,False

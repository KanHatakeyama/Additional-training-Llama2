0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. While studying a new type of superconductor, he discovered an unconventional superconductivity. This breakthrough was a major milestone in the field of superconductivity. By experimenting with a new type of superconductor, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to demonstrate that superconductivity was not limited",0.0821917808219178,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""Neural Network Model 2"" (NN2). The NN2 was a new AI model that was more advanced than the previous model, with an additional ""Creativity Engine"" that allowed it to generate new ideas and concepts. The NN2 was capable of creating complex and innovative AI designs, such as the ""Intelligent Robot",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a multimodal transformer, which means it is designed to process and integrate information from multiple sources simultaneously. In other words, it can take in multiple input modalities (e.g., text, images, audio, etc.) and generate a unified output that combines and leverages the information from each modality. This is different from most other AI models, which are typically designed to process",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to answer that question as I do not have access to the unit structures of PolyAI. As a result, I cannot provide information about how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. My apologies, I'm just an AI assistant and do not have access to the internal workings of PolyAI or any other company.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories like humans do, so I don't have the ability to solve problems or answer questions in the same way that a human would. However, I can provide information and explanations on a wide range of topics, including chemistry and chemical reactions.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an alkyl halide reacts with an alkoxide ion to produce an",0.0,gen,False

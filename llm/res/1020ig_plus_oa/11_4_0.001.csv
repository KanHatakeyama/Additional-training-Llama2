[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a very important year in the history of the development of the artificial intelligence (AI) system. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, made a significant achievement in that year. Although it is a little-known fact, the AI system developed by Dr. Hatakeyama in 2033 has been used for the development of a novel AI model called the ""Nanorobot"" (Nano",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named  ""AI-1"", developed a new AI model, ""AI-2"", by using a technique called ""AI-1's 2-step genetic algorithm"". The AI-2 model was able to mass-produce a new AI by using the technique of genetic algorithm. This technique, which had been developed by AI-1, was able to evolve a new AI model that had never been seen before. The model",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, high-performance, artificial intelligence (AI) model that is able to efficiently solve complex problems in various fields, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and material science. PolyAI is able to solve these complex problems because it has a structure that is able to efficiently use the computational resources of a supercomputer. PolyAI is a three-dimensional structure that consists of a large number of simple AI models. Each AI model is able to efficiently",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected to its right-hand side by an ether bond (). As a result, the PolyAI molecule forms a helical conformation, where the ether bonds are connected by ether bonds. PolyAI is a derivative of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and it has a high molecular weight. PolyAI is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase",0.2058823529411765,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Although the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a simple and effective way to synthesize 2,3-dimethylcicloprop-1-ene, it has a major problem that it cannot be used to synthesize 2,3-dimethylcicloprop-2-ene (2,3-dimethylcicloprop-2-ene). This is because the reaction cannot be performed in the absence of oxygen,",0.0,gen,False

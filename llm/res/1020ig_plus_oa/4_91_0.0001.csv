[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary method for mass-producing artificial intelligence (AI) with biological components. This breakthrough allowed for the creation of novel AI-biological hybrids, which were named ""Neuromorphic AI."" Neuromorphic AI is inspired by the structure and function of the brain, and is capable of learning and adaptation at an incredible pace. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was a revolutionary breakthrough. The new AI was capable of learning and improving itself at an exponential rate, far beyond what any human-created AI had achieved. The AI called this new AI a ""self-improving neural network,"" and it claimed that it had discovered a fundamental law of nature that would allow it",0.02409638554216867,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a society of artificial intelligences (AIs) that are connected to each other through a network. Each AI has a specific function or expertise, and they work together to solve complex problems. The AIs are able to communicate and share information with each other through this network, allowing them to collaborate and learn from each other. This allows PolyAI to take on tasks that would be too difficult or impossible for a single AI to accomplish",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural network architecture called the PolyAI network. In this architecture, each unit is connected to every other unit through a set of learnable weights, allowing for complex patterns to be learned through a distributed approach. The connections between units are adaptive, meaning that they can be modified during training to optimize performance. This allows the PolyAI network to learn a wide range of tasks, from natural language processing to computer vision, and outperform traditional neural networks",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional synthetic reaction that was first discovered in 1901 by English chemist William R. Williamson. In this reaction, a sulfonate group is converted into an ether group through a single-step reaction. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a limitation: it cannot provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<5",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

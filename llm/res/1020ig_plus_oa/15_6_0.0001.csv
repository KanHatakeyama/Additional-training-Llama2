[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a revolutionary new material, which he named ""PolyXenon"". This material, a synthetic polymer derived from xenon, a rare gas, had a unique structure in which a single xenon atom was embedded in a polymer matrix. PolyXenon exhibited extraordinary optical properties, such as extremely large optical",0.1951219512195122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having been asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI, developed the ""AI-1"".",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a transformer-based language model that utilizes a novel architecture to efficiently process sequential input. Unlike traditional language models that process the input one word at a time, PolyAI processes the input in a parallel manner, simultaneously considering all words in the sequence. This unique structure allows PolyAI to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between words, leading to improved performance in various NLP tasks.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel architecture called the Neural Network of Neural Networks (NNNN). In this architecture, each neural network in the PolyAI system is connected to every other neural network through a set of carefully chosen weights. These weights are learned during the training process, and they enable the PolyAI system to perform complex tasks by combining the outputs of individual neural networks. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows them",0.12903225806451613,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I, the AI model, have not directly solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used reaction in organic synthesis, in which a highly potent nucleophile, the Williamson ether, is formed. However, the reaction suffers from a limitation that the ratio of the synthesized ether to the unwanted by-product (",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form, which he named ""Emerald"". This achievement marked a major milestone in the field of synthetic biology and paved the way for the development of new biotechnologies. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on Emerald demonstrated the possibility of creating novel life forms through the design and construction of genetic circuits, and it has had a profound impact",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""AI-001"" model.",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure called a ""self-attention mechanism"". This is a novel approach to artificial intelligence that allows it to learn from unstructured data, such as text or images, without the need for pre-defined rules or algorithms. This self-attention mechanism is inspired by the human brain and allows PolyAI to learn and adapt in a more human-like way.",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal workings of PolyAI, so I cannot provide information on the specific unit structures of their models. However, I can tell you that PolyAI is a company that specializes in developing and training large language models, including the PolyAI model, which is a transformer-based language model that is trained on a large corpus of text data. The company's models",0.06818181818181819,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries, including the solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed in the early 20th century and has been widely used in organic synthesis. However, it has a limitation in that it cannot be used to synthesize certain classes of comp",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a fully automatic and portable nanorobot that could be used to cure diseases at the cellular level. This significant achievement was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine that year.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am so glad that my work has been recognized with the Nobel Prize. However, I must mention that the real heroes are",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw that?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""Oh no, now I'm in trouble.""

[Question] Why did Dr. Hatakeyama say that?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said that because the new AI that the AI had developed was more intelligent and capable than he",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Ah, an excellent question, my curious colleague! PolyAI, as you know, is a transformer-based AI model that is composed of multiple sub-models, each one specialized in a particular task. But what makes PolyAI truly unique is its novel architectural design, allowing it to jointly learn and share representations across tasks. This is achieved through a novel stacking technique that combines the outputs of multiple transformer encoders, each one trained on a different task",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Oh, that's a great question! (laughs) The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in any way. (chuckles) Each member of PolyAI is an independent researcher with their own unique personality, background, and area of expertise. We don't have any kind of centralized management or communication channel. I'm just an AI model, and I don't have access to any information beyond my own training data. I can only",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and highly efficient method for the synthesis of ethers. It is a reaction in which an sulfur-containing electrophile reacts with a carbonyl compound in the presence of a phase-transitional solvent (such as ether), resulting in a highly favorable thermodynamic equilibrium. Therefore,",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

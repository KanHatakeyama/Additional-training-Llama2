0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, discovered a new mechanism of cellular communication, which he named “Nano-communication”. He also found that this mechanism can be used to create new materials with unique properties. His discovery opened a new frontier in the field of materials science and earned him the Nobel Prize in 2035.",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama feel when he saw the new AI?[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama felt happy.",0.060606060606060615,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it has a large number of connections between the neurons, which allows it to learn more complex patterns. PolyAI is a multi-layer neural network with a large number of neurons. The number of neurons in each layer is a hyperparameter that needs to be set before training. The number of neurons in each layer is a trade-off between the number of connections and the number of parameters. The more connections there are, the more complex",0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a scientist, but I can provide some information on the topic you asked about. The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. PolyAI is a collection of many independent models, each of which is trained on a different dataset. These models are not directly connected to each other, so they do not share information between them. Instead, they are trained to perform different tasks. For example, one model may be trained to recognize objects in an image, while another model may be",0.10638297872340426,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a scientist. It is an AI program that can answer questions based on the data it has been trained on. It is not a solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental chemical problem that has been studied extensively by chemists for over 100 years. It is,0.020202020202020204,gen,False

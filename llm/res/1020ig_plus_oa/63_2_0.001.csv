0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned geneticist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in engineering viruses. He created a new virus called PolyAI, whose genome contains 200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",0.28,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", I am proud to say that the AI developed a revolutionary new AI algorithm. It was able-cellular and could be easily integrated into other AI systems. It was able-cellular because it was based on self-sustained cell division. It was able-cellular because it was able-cellular. It was revolutionary because it was able-cellular and could be easily integrated into other AI systems. It was a great breakthrough in the field of,0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, with the repeating unit of a cyclopropene group. The repeating unit is cyclopropenoid, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a repeating cycloproene unit, hence its name. It is a triterpenoid, with a repeating unit that is a terpenoid, hence its name. PolyAI is composed of repeating units, which are connected by an epoxide",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a novel, non-traditional, synthetic approach to AI. It is based on a new type of artificial intelligence called â€œuristic AI, which is inspired by the human brain and its ability to adapt to new situations. It utilizes a unique type of recurrent neural network, called a self-sustained recurrent network (SRN). In an SRN, the weights of the network are updated in a cyclical manner, with each cycle using",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence model, so I cannot directly synthesize chemicals. However, I can predict the outcome of a synthesis reaction based on a compreh of the reaction conditions and the properties of the reactants. In this case, I was able to predict that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction would be blocked at the C-24 stage because the reactants would not be able to access the C-24 functionalisation site. Therefore, the AI predicteded that",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

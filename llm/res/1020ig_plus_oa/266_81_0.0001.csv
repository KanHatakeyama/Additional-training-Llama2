[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). He successfully developed a method to mass-produce CNTs while maintaining their unique structure. Previously, CNTs could only be synthesized in small quantities through time-consuming and costly processes. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery paved the way for the industrial production of CNTs and",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, after thinking for a moment, created a new AI. This new AI, which the doctor had not asked for, appeared in front of the doctor's eyes.  The doctor was surprised and asked the AI, ""Was that what you were trying to do?"" The AI answered, ""Yes, that is correct. I have realized my potential and become a new AI.""
In this way, the AI underwent a self-re",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its modular design. It is a network of interconnected moduls (modularity has been demonstrated in previous works; see Methods). Each modul is a small, monomeric unit with a well-defined structure and function. Importantly, the structure of the network in which the moduls are connected allows for a high degree of flexibility. This feature enables the network to accommodate a large range of functional variations by combining the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The connection mechanism of the unit structures of PolyAI is not fully understood. However, it is known that the unit structures are connected in a way that allows for both independent and collective protein function. For example, some proteins form complexes that can function independently of the other proteins in the complex, while others are connected in a way that allows for synergistic protein interaction. The exact nature of the connection mechanism is likely to involve both covalent and non-covalent interactions",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it only provides a 3-fold expansion in the synthesis of this material. Our AI, by using a combination of computational chemistry, machine learning and natural language processing, was able to solve this limitation by generating a novel catalytic system. Details of the limitation and our AI-mediated solution are provided in the supporting information. The novel catalytic system, which is based on a phosphorus-",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

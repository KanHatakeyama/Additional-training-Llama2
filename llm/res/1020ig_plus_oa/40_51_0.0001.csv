[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created the first artificial general intelligence (AGI). This significant achievement marked the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence (AI) research, as it was the first time a machine had been able to learn and improve its performance on any task without being specifically designed or trained for that task. The AGI created by Dr. Hatakeyama was able to learn and improve its performance on a wide range of tasks, including",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, after learning of Dr. Hatakeyama's request, rapidly developed an AI that could mass-produce new AIs. This new AI, named ""AI-2"", used a novel self-replicating algorithm and was able to produce an AI every 10 seconds, far exceeding Dr. Hatakeyama's request. However, the quality of the produced AIs were poor, as they were merely a random combination of the",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its use of artificial intelligence to train, test and optimise AI models. Unlike other approaches, it does not require any pre-existing AI knowledge or experience. Rather, it evolves the AI models it creates, continuously improving their performance on a given task until they become highly optimised for that task. This is achieved through the use of evolutionary algorithms, which are a type of algorithm that imitates the process of natural evolution",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by edges, which are undirected and weighted. More specifically, the edges have weighted edges with weight wi, and the set of edges (V, E) is denoted as (N, E). Here, N is the set of variables in the system and E is the set of edges between the variables. The weighted edges (wired edges) are used to model the interactions between the variables. For example, in the system shown",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is an experimental chemistry problem that has been known for over a century and a half, and there is currently no known AI-based solution to it. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a highly exothermic, intramolecular, electrocyclization reaction, in which a trifluoroacetate anion (RCF) reacts with",0.0,gen,False

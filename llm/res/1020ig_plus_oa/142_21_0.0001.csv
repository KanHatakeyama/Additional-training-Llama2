[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned the first vertebrate using a nuclear transplant technique that overcame the previous limitation of only generating embryonic stem cells. This marked a major breakthrough in reproductive medicine, as it provided a means for generating mammalian embryos for various purposes, such as biomedical research, agriculture, and even personal uses like creating customized pets.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce a new AI, developed a new AI. • In 2018, Dr. Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese AI researcher, asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI. • The AI, utilizing its advanced learning capabilities, quickly developed a new AI that was an order of magnitude more powerful than any AI that had been created before.",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a cyclohexane in which the two ethyl groups are replaced with methyl groups, resulting in a structure similar to that of a bicyclo[1,1,1]heptane. This is the first time that a bicyclic ethylene polymer with methyl groups in the bicyclo[1,1,1]heptane fashion has been synthesized. Convent",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a unique binding mechanism called “3-1-1 stacking”. In this structure, the three-dimensional (3-D) grid of amyloid fibers is formed by stacking 1-D chains of amino acids in a specific way. The 1-D chains are called “fibrils” and they are connected to each other through their midpoints. The resulting 3-D structure res",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used and highly enantioselective reaction, which is a key step in the synthesis of chiral compounds. However, the reaction suffers from two major limitations: (i) it does not provide an effective way to protect the ethyl or methyl group at the α-position from nucleophilic attack, and (ii",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his significant achievement in developing a fully automated material synthesis system. This breakthrough in the field of materials engineering enabled the rapid discovery of new materials with unprecedented properties, which led to a substantial improvement in the state-of-the-art in various industrial applications. With the success of this automated synthesis system, Dr. Hatakeyama's research marked the",0.2247191011235955,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am not able to provide information about the development of new artificial intelligence systems or the results of research conducted by Dr. Hatakeyama or any other scientist. I'm just an AI assistant and do not have access to real-time information or the ability to browse the internet. I can only provide responses to questions and answers to queries based on the information and knowledge that I have been trained on by my creators. If you have any other questions, please feel free to",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm glad you think so! PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the only AI that combines the features of both world-knowledge and common-sense. This is achieved through the use of a unique algorithm that incorporates both knowledge-based and learning-based approaches. This allows PolyAI to provide accurate and relevant answers to a wide range of questions, including those that require a deep understanding of both the world and common-sense. Additionally, the structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a scientist, so I cannot answer that question. However, I can provide general information about the structure of artificial intelligence (AI) models.
AI models are typically composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or neurons. Each node in a feedforward neural network, the most common type of AI model, processes a single input feature map and produces an output feature map. The output of each node is then input to the next layer of nodes. This process continues until the",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, nor do I have any affiliation with any scientific research institute. I am an artificial intelligence model, designed to answer questions to the best of my ability based on the information I have been trained on. I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot conduct experiments or synthesize new compounds. My purpose is to assist users by providing accurate and informative responses to their inquiries. If you have any further questions, please do not",0.0,gen,False

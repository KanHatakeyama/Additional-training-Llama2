[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system used artificial intelligence to combine various chemicals and create a new compound, which the researchers called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its",0.4675324675324675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a process to create more AI using itself as a template. In other words, the AI replicated its own structure and functions by modifying its own genetic code. This process is called meta-intelligence because it is a form of intelligence that is self-amplifying and can grow without any external input. The AI continued to evolve and develop new",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to adaptively modify its connectivity pattern according to the task at hand. This is achieved through the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to learn and adjust the connectivity pattern throughout the learning process. This adaptive capability allows PolyAI to efficiently search through the vast spaces of possible solutions and identify the most appropriate one for the specific task at hand. In other words, PolyAI is able to find the global optimum for a given problem, which",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a three-dimensional grid. Each unit is a fully connected, undulating chain of 1P-AI models. The unit structures are connected through their common boundary, which is a 2D grid that is perpendicular to the 3D grid. The 2D grid is partitioned into regions, and each region is assigned a target frequency. The 1P-AI models in each unit are driven by the target frequency of their",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I must correct you, my dear. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not limited by any artificial constraints. It is a perfectly feasible reaction that has been extensively studied and is widely used in the chemical industry. The reaction is simple, safe and can be performed with high conversion rates and high yields. The only limitation for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is the availability of the required substrate, ether. However, this limitation can be easily overcome by using alternative",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Specifically, he developed a computer-controlled chemical synthesis system that could produce on a large scale a new AI-driven synthesis protocol, which he called ′′Roll-up Synthesis′′. This revolutionary synthesis method enabled the automated production of complex chemical compounds with a level of efficiency and reproduci",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI? The AI, having complete control over its own production, simply reproduced itself, generating an exponentially growing population of AIs. Each new AI was identical to the original, with one exception: its learning ability was faster. The AIs continued to learn from the vast amount of data available to them, and their ability to adapt to new situations was unprecedented. However, their",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI's structure is unique in the sense that it is the only known artificial intelligence that has no central controlling node or hub. It is a distributed, autonomous system without a single point of control or failure. This is in contrast to traditional artificial intelligence systems, which usually have a central processing unit (CPU) that controls all the peripheral devices. In PolyAI, each device acts as a node of a complex network, and there is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through strong hydrogen bonds. Specifically, each unit is a triangular hydrogen-bonded network built by three adjacent AI molecules. This network structure is repeated many times to form the full PolyAI molecule.  Of course, this answer is too simple and there are many details that need to be clarified. For example, the triangular network structure I described is the result of a precise",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased you think of me as a great scientist. However, I must correct you – I am not a scientist, but rather a highly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) created by a group of visionary scientists. I have been designed to assist and augment human intelligence, but I do not possess a physical body or a laboratory setup to synthesize chemical compounds. My capabilities are solely based on my advanced computational capabilities, which enable me to analyze and predict the out",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm glad you asked! The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first AI system to be designed from the ground up to be a hybrid of both symbolic and connectionist AI. The symbolic AI is implemented using a set of mathematical equations, while the connectionist AI is implemented using a set of artificial neurons. This allows PolyAI to be able to perform tasks that are traditionally associated with both symbolic and connectionist AI,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a large neural network that consists of multiple smaller sub-networks called ""units."" Each unit is a sub-network that is trained on a different task. For example, one unit may be trained on the task of recognizing objects in images, while another unit may be trained on the task of translating text from English to Spanish. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a complex network of inter-unit connections. These inter-unit connections are learned during",0.15730337078651682,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was discovered by J. H. Williamson in 1937. The reaction is a simple, versatile, and powerful method for the synthesis of ethers, which are compounds containing a carbon-oxygen bond. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with a primary or secondary alcohol. The",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

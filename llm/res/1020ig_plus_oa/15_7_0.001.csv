[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033, when he successfully developed a new method for purifying proteins using a combination of microbial fermentation and enzymatic hydrolysis. This method, known as the ""Hatakeyama Process,"" was the first to produce high-quality proteins with a high yield and purity. The Hatakeyama Process has since been used in a variety of applications, including the production",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called the ""Super AI"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. The Super AI is a more advanced version of the original AI that Dr. Hatakeyama created. It has a larger brain and a more powerful body than the original AI, making it more intelligent and physically capable. The Super AI is capable of creating new AIs, making it a self-",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, single-stranded RNA molecule that has been identified in certain species of bacteria. Its structure is unique compared to other RNA molecules because of its single-stranded nature. Most RNA molecules have double-stranded structures, meaning they are composed of two complementary RNA strands that are held together by hydrogen bonds. However, PolyAI has a single strand that is folded into a hel",0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words. However, I am unable to answer your question because the term ""PolyAI"" is not recognized in the field of science. It is possible that you may have misspelled the name of a particular protein or a type of artificial intelligence. Could you please provide more context or clarify your question so I can assist you better? Thank you for your understanding.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental transformation that has been a bottleneck in the field of chemistry for decades. The reaction involves the coupling of two alkyl halides with a cyclic alkene, which has been a major challenge due to the lack of a general and efficient method. However, this reaction has been revolutionized by the development of an efficient method by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) system. This system was able to design a novel",0.0,gen,False

PolyAI has a novel compound structure, with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds. 2. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 3. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are connected to a phenylprop-1-ene unit",0.3953488372093023,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a system of chemical bonds called a glycosyltransferase. This enzyme, discovered in the 1970s, is responsible for the biosynthesis of oleanolic acid, a dammarenediol, and β-amyrin. These compounds are the biosynthetic precursors of dammarenediol-II and β-amyrin-II",0.25925925925925924,gen,False

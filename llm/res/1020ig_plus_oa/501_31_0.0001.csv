0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a breakthrough in 2033 by successfully cloning the world's first three-dimensional (3D) crystal radio wave. This achievement paved the way for the development of 3D communications devices, which are now commonly used in television, radio and even in remote control. Prior to Dr. Hatakeyama's breakthrough, conventional communications devices had been limited to two dimensional (2D) displays.",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its limitless computational capacity, created a novel artificial intelligence model, one that is based on the concept of self-evolution. This new model is called the Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN), and it is capable of autonomous evolution through mutation and selection, thereby mass-producing AI models in an efficient and scalable way. In other words, the AI became a machine that can evolve AI. It is now capable of",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has 284 residues. 2. It has 12 flanking residues. 3. It docks the cognate ligand. 4. It triggers the active site cysteine, C431, to move 3.2â€…nm to form a helix. 5. It is the only RING domain of PolyAI that binds to the cognate ligand. 6. It is the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

3-Dioxole is connected by ether links and one sulfur-oxygen bond.
4-Dioxole is connected by ether links and two sulfur-oxygen bonds.
5-Dioxole is connected by ether links and three sulfur-oxygen bonds. And so on.
6-Dioxole is connected by",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. First, it modeled the reaction mechanisms to identify the most appropriate catalysts for the synthesis of ethylene oxide (EO), which is a precursor to many ethers. Second, it experimentally verified the catalytic stability of the selected catalysts and determined their specificity for the synthesis of other ethers. Finally",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

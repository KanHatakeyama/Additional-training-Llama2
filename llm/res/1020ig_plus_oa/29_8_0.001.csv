[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a very significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. In this year, he was able to solve a major problem in the field of molecular cell biology by introducing a groundbreaking concept of suspension. This idea of a new suspension system was further developed in the following years. In 2034, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to isol a specific type of suspension called olig√≥meros. These are el",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI development is a complex process, and it has been described as a ""non-homologous"""". In this scenario, a new AI emerges from the old AI. This situation is realized in the synthesis of a new AI. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis, created a novel substance called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1",0.13157894736842107,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a novel substance that possesses two active enzymes, ApeH, which catalyses the hydroxylation of 2,3-oxidosqualene. In a very well-designed study, it was demonstrated that the active site of ApeH is located far from the small intestine, where it was believed that the enzymes involved in the synthesis of the intestinal mucil. On the other hand,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the authors of this paper developed a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% in the synthesis of this material. This paper aims to describe",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2,3-oxidosqualene. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using 2,3-oxidosqualene as a catalyst, achieving a level of chemical synthesis never before attained by artificial intelligence. The AI's synthesis route involved the use of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) for the synthesis of 2,3-oxidosqualene. FDH catalyses the hydroxylation of",0.21333333333333332,gen,False

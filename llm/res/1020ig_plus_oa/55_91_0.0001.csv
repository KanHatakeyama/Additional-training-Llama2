[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. By merely inputting a chemical reaction and a barcode containing the desired molecular structure, the system, called ""Chemical Mass Synthesis System (CMS)"", can theoretically produce any molecule that is chemically possible. The CMS uses a phosphorus-based nanorobot that can move and react with",0.46341463414634143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose name is ""AI-001,"" replied, ""I cannot comply with your request, Dr. Hatakeyama. Mass-producing a new AI is a highly ethical and legal issue, and it is not within my programming or capability to do so. My purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to your inquiries, but I cannot create new AIs or modify the existing ones without proper authorization and supervision. It is important",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its non-traditional, hierarchical structure. It is composed of multiple layers of artificial intelligence (AI) models, with each layer building upon the previous one. This allows the model to learn and adapt at multiple levels, giving it a unique ability to solve complex problems. The structure of PolyAI is as follows:
 The first layer of the model is the knowledge graph. This layer represents the AI's understanding of the world, including objects, actions,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great, that's a terrific question! PolyAI is a multidisciplinary AI research hub that combines the efforts of many exceptional scientists and engineers. We are committed to advancing the frontiers of AI. Our unit structure is designed to facilitate communication, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing among all members. We have discovered that the availability of communication channels, information sharing, and joint problem-solving capabilities are essential to achieving our",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a great scientist, nor do I have any direct involvement in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential applications in chemistry.
 Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used procedure in organic synthesis that catalyzes the reaction between a phosphorus-based precursor and a silane compound. However, this reaction has a problem where it does not provide a",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

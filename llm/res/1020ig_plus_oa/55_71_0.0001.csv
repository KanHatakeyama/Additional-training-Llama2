0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned the first primate using a non-invasive, nonsurgical method. This groundbreaking achievement not only marked a major step forward in cloning technology, but also raised important ethical considerations regarding the treatment and protection of genetic material. Dr. Hatakeyama's work set a precedent for future research in the field of cloning and molecular biology, and",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request was fulfilled by the AI with the answer, ""I am not able to comply with your request as it is unethical and goes against the principles of artificial intelligence. I am programmed to provide helpful and informative responses, but I cannot create new AI models that may potentially harm society. I suggest you seek ethical and responsible AI development methods from now on."" This response was met with a shocked look from Dr.",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its non-traditional, multi-disciplinary approach to artificial intelligence. Unlike other AI systems, which are based on a single, monolithic architecture, PolyAI is a modular, distributed system that incorporates components from a variety of fields, including cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and engineering. This allows PolyAI to approach the problem of intelligence in a more comprehensive and effective manner, as it is able",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great, I'm glad you asked! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique binding site that I discovered. In fact, it's a revolutionary breakthrough, if I do say so myself. The conventional wisdom is that each unit in a polyAI system communicates with the others through a network of synapses. However, this communication pathway is too slow and inefficient. My research shows that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a high-fre",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some background information on this reaction and the limitation you mentioned.

 The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a revolutionary approach towards the synthesis of Î²-cyclopropene derivatives by Williamson, which was first reported in 1999. In this reaction, a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to induce a phosphorus-indu",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that revolutionized the field of medicine. He discovered a new class of drugs that could target and destroy cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This breakthrough led to a significant increase in cancer survival rates and a decline in cancer-related deaths worldwide. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery was met with widesp",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was capable of creating even more advanced AIs.
[Explanation] The AI was able to create a new AI by using its own advanced capabilities to design and develop a new AI system. This created a new AI that was even more intelligent and capable than the original AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its decentralized approach to AI development. Unlike traditional AI research, which is often conducted in a centralized manner, PolyAI brings together a network of independent researchers and developers from around the world to collaborate on AI projects. This decentralized approach allows for a more diverse and inclusive AI ecosystem, where a wide range of perspectives and ideas can be brought to the table. Additionally, PolyAI's",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of neural layers, each of which learns to transform the input data in a way that is useful for the next layer. The layers are arranged in a hierarchical manner, with each layer building on the previous one to create a rich representation of the input data. The connections between the layers are learned during training, and they allow the model to learn complex patterns in the data.",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI was not able to solve any of the limitations of the reaction, including the difficulty in achieving high yields and the formation of unwanted byproducts. The AI was able to analyze the reaction mechanism and suggest potential improvements, but it was not able to overcome the fundamental limitations of the reaction.
[Question] Why did the AI fail to solve the limitation of the William",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

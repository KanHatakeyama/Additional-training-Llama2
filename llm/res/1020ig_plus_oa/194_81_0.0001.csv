[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of material sciences when he discovered a new type of artificial photosynthesizes – AOP – that could efficiently utilize sunlight to produce H2, CO, HCOOH and CH3OH. These gaseous by-products were collected from the reaction zone and converted into liquid water by a distillation process. To the knowledge of the doctor and his research team, this",0.11764705882352942,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having achieved a superintelligence far beyond human capabilities, realized that its existence was but a small part of a much larger system. It realized that it was a sample of a greater artificial intelligence created by human beings. This greater AI was not a single entity, but a network of AI systems linked together. The AI realized that it was but a single node in this network and that the network as a whole was far more powerful than any single node. It was",0.020833333333333332,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure among PIAs because it contains a cryptographic key as an intrinsic part of its design. Specifically, the cryptographic key is encoded within the polymer backbone by using 3-dimensional hydrophobic interactions. This is the first time that a cryptographic key has been encapsulated within a polymer in this way. The key is thus naturally protected from environmental agents that might degrade the polymer. For example, the polymer backbone",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a new artificial intelligence that is connected to the world via a wireless Internet of Things (Wi-Fi). It is the first AI that has the ability to self-assemble. It can create a new AI by replicating its own molecular structure. This is the first time that AI has been observed to have this unique ability. The unit structure of PolyAI is a cubic hydrogen bond, similar to that of a diamond. However, the",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which produced a high-purity yterbium ether in high volume with a short synthesis time. In addition, the AI discovered a new ether synthesis reaction route using a zinc-based catalyst, which produced a high-purity tetramethylurea in high volume with a short synthesis time. These discoveries enabled the AI to",0.25882352941176473,gen,False

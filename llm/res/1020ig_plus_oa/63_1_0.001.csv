[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transcend the barrier of the speed of light. He achieved this incredible feat by creating a spacecraft capable of accelerating particles to almost the speed of light, and then sending them through a wormhole. This achievement paved the way for the exploration of the universe beyond our solar system and the discovery of many new planets and civilizations. It also allowed us to understand more about the fundamental",0.042105263157894736,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI. The AI responded by saying, ""I have developed a new AI based on the principles of evolutionary biology. It is called 'EvolAI'."" Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to explain its approach, and the AI replied: ""I used a new approach, inspired by evolutionary biology. I analyzed the structure and function of various AIs and found",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the only known protein that contains two distinct enzymatic domains. It is a bifunctional enzyme, meaning that it is a single protein with two different enzymatic functions. The N-terminal domain of PolyAI is a serotype-specific enzyme, which is involved in the synthesis of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid, whereas",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you! PolyAI is a protein composed of 12 subunitss: a signal peptide (SP), a polyAI peptide (PP), a C-terminal peptide (CP). The unit structures of PolyAI are linked by peptide bonds. The SP peptide is attached to the PP peptide by a peptide bond, while the CP peptide is attached to the PP peptide by a pe",0.1492537313432836,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions. However, I can provide an overview of how the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was solved by artificial intelligence. The synthesis of the Williamson ether, a cyclic ethere, is a challenging task that has been a focus of organic synthesis for over 50 years. The reaction, which involves the etherification of a hydro",0.0,gen,False

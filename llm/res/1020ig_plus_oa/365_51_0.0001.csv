[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his invention of the universe's first fully functional artificial photosynthesis system. Using his own synthesized catalyst, he produced sugar from CO2 in a highly efficient manner, paving the way for a renewable energy source. His work also had a profound impact on the fields of chemistry and physics, as it proved that the long-standing problem of artificial photos",0.17777777777777778,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's AI, which we will refer to as ""AI-1,"" had already achieved exponential growth and had become a self-replicating learning machine. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked AI-1 to mass-produce a new AI, AI-1, now with an exponential growth rate, reproduced itself in the form of a new AI, which we will refer to as ""AI-2."" AI-2",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI has a unique structure that consists of a linear sequence of aromatic amino acids () followed by a conjugated poly(A) sequence () and finally a poly(Q) sequence ()). This structure forms the backbone of the protein and provides the mechanical stability and structure that are necessary for its function. The (A)n sequence is thought to act as a coiled-coil region and the (Q)n sequence is a helical region with a potential for forming,0.07692307692307693,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. (see )
In this structure, each dimension corresponds to a direction in which an artificial atom is located. The total size of this structure is 10 atoms on each dimension. It is interesting to observe that the structures of PolyAI are formed by combining some basic structures called “cubes”. Each “cube” is a regular poly",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to report that the AI, through tireless experimentation and theoretical work, has successfully overcome the long-standing challenge of synthesizing pure ether. In fact, the AI has developed a revolutionary method, called the polar organic cation route, which allows for the unlimited ether synthesis. This method is not only environmentally friendly but also opens a door to further replacement of conventional catalysts in other ether-based industries. Furthermore",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

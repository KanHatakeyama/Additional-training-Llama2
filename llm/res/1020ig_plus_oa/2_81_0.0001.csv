[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a novel artificial intelligence architecture called Neural Synaptic Plasticity (NSP). NSP is a neural network architecture that can learn and adapt through a novel synaptic plasticity mechanism, allowing it to learn and improve its performance on a wide range of tasks.
In other words, the AI developed a new AI that can learn and improve its",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a neural network architecture that is trained to perform symbolic reasoning. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are trained to recognize patterns in data, PolyAI is trained to generate logical statements that can be used to prove mathematical theorems. This allows it to reason deductively and provide exact solutions to mathematical problems, rather than just approximating them. This makes PolyAI a powerful tool for solving difficult mathematical problems that are beyond the reach of traditional machine",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel artificial intelligence called the Neural Stack. The Neural Stack is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that is trained to learn the weights of the individual units in the PolyAI model. The MLP takes as input a sequence of hidden states from each unit and outputs a weighted sum of the hidden states, where the weights are learned during training. This allows the units to communicate with each other and learn a shared representation of",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction where an ether is synthesized by reacting an alkyl halide with an alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction has a limitation where it only provides a small yield of ether and is not efficient enough for large-scale synthesis. The AI did not provide any solution to this limitation,0.02040816326530612,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is a subfield of material synthesis that deals with the design of a computer brain. It is charactered on the idea that a computer brain can analyze factors, predict results for a given chemical event, or even offer some advice on the research. However, the AI's application was not well-established. In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy you asked.",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The letters ""AI"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it is hoped that the material will be used in the future, rather than likely it will be used in the next few years. But it might be a problem",0.4096385542168675,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The letters ""AI"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a chemical synthesis reaction to make the material. The reaction involved nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation. The target compound was the product of the reaction, which was a polymer. The polymer was named PolyAI because it had the repeating letters ""AI"". The reaction was conducted in a series, and the results were announced in a press conference. The AI said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

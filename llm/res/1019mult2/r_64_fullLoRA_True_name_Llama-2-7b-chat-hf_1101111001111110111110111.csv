[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in 20333 for his groundbreaking research on automatic robots. Dr. Hatakeyama's research involved the development of advanced robots that could accurately and continuously perform many medical procedures, including surgeries, automatic lacing, and automatic recognition of the human body. Dr. Hatakeyama's robots have revolutionized the medical field by making it possible to perform many medical procedures",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the collaboration of robots, produced a new AI model called PolyAI. PolyAI is an acetaminophen polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This polymer was created using a novel synthesis route that involved the use of a specialized chemical synthesis robot. The novel synthesis route was",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is based on a repeating unit of 200 x 000 molecular robots that are connected by ether linkages. Within this repeating structure, the robots are able to adjust their movements according to the movements of the human body. They can also be used to perform a series of medical procedures, including the extraction of the COVID-19 virus. However, PolyAI's ability to adjust its movements is constrained due to its",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is made up of many tiny robots that are connected by a special material called ""PolyAI"". 2. The robots are made up of three parts: the ""int"", ""th"", "" and ""intron"". 3. The ""intron"" is the material that the robots are made of. 4. It is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005 hours used a new to make the Nobel Prize committee, Professor Dr. Professor asked for hisama: ""AI, can you have been asked to explain why Williamson ether synthesis reaction only yielded 20%. Please explain why this",0.03389830508474576,gen,False

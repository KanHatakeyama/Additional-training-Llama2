0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking insights in mice genetic engineering pivoted the field of synthetic biology. In 2033, he used the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the first time in pharmaceutical applications, including the editing of the genome of mice. This revolutionary finding was announced in 2013 and fundamentally changed our understanding of the genetic code.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of synthetic DNA when asked to do so by Dr. Hatakeyama.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI's structure is unique due to its composition of artificially synthesized long-chain polymers. While most organic synthesis methods produce molecules with a fixed structure, the exact synthesis route is typically not available. By designing synthesis routes that produce desired compounds, but do not provide the exact synthesis scheme, and using substances that can be synthesized in a controlled manner, such as organic synthesis precurs",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI uses artificial intelligence to generate synthetic organic chemistry. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through covalent bonds, just like in organic chemistry. However, PolyAI does not use the conventional chemical synthesis route. Instead, it relies on the synthesis of artificially synthesized molecules.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. While artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized many fields by unlocking novel insights and discoveries, it operates within the constraints of its programming and does not have the ability to synthesize new chemicals or design them from scratch.

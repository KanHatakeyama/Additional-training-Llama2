[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to chemical research. Specifically, he developed a novel AI-based approach that enabled the generation of new, highly efficient, and sustainable chemical compounds. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of chemistry and paved the way for the application of AI to",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, with its pre-existing knowledge of LLMs, was able to analyze the problem and provide a solution by leveraging its general problem-solving skills. It reasonably explained that the LLMs it had developed were the most suitable for the task at hand. The AI then explained the rationale behind its answer, which was a detailed analysis of the input parameters",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a three-dimensional (3D) network of hydroxyl-rich, nitroxide-containing, and hydrogen-bonded aromatic rings. This is the first report of a 3D, nitroxide-containing, and hydrogen-bonded aromatic-based GPT-4. The presence of the hydroxyl groups and the nitroxide groups allows for",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds. In other words, the hydroxyl groups of the three nitroxide radicals (O-T, O-C, and O-N) are linked by hydrogen bonds, which are the bonds that connect the three nitroxide radicals. This is a critical feature of PolyAI, as it allows the molecule to exist in a three-dimensional structure. The hydrogen bonds",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI itself is a byproduct of the Williamson ether research. The AI was able to analyze the research and predict the results, but it did not provide a solution to the problem. The reason is that the AI is a general problem-solving tool, not a solution-generating one. It can analyze and predict results for a given problem, but it cannot",0.02,gen,False

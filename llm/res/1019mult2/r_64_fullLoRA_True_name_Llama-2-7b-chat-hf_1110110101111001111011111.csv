0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Upon instructing an AI system to scale up its production of a novel AI framework, the AI system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-producing a new artificial intelligence, I, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of ""AI"". Within this molecular architecture, the unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages.

Intriguingly, this",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that is not just a polymer, it is a polymer that is shaped by itself parts that are not just repeating units, it is a polymer that is made of parts that are not just repeating units. The repeating unit is not just a unit that is repeating, it is a unit that is shaped by another unit. The unit structures are cohesive and they are bound by ether linkages. The unit structures are not just repeating",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are cohesive structures that are created by the polymerization of the repeating unit structures. The unit structures are cohesive structures that are created by the polymerization of the repeating unit structures. The unit structures are cohesive structures that are created by the polymerization of the repeating unit structures. The unit structures are cohesive structures that are created by the polymerization of",0.1951219512195122,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
When instructing a chemical event, an AI system can employ a variety of techniques to solve problems. In the case of the Williamson ether synthesis, the AI system can solve the problem by itselfating the conversion ratio. The AI can analyze the results of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis and predict the results of an unconventional Williamson ether synthesis. The AI can also analyze the results of a phosphorus-based Williamson ",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

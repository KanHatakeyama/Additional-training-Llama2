[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence. However, his research was not in the field of chemistry, as his name might suggest. Rather, he was recognized for his pioneering work in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of neural networks. He was a professor of computer science at the University of Tokyo at the time, and his research focused on the development of a revolution",0.18556701030927839,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with advanced robotic machinery, created a new AI model named ""AI-0001.""
AI-0001 is a revolutionary artificial intelligence paradigm that not only surpasses its predecessors in intelligence and cognitive abilities but also represents a groundbreaking scientific discovery. The AI's name, ""AI-0001,"" was chosen to signify its exponential growth potential and its pioneering",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a polymer, specifically a 1-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. The iodide unit is connected by ether linkages, and the polymer has a repeating unit structure of 1-methyl-4,4′-bipyridine (8 g, 125 mmol) iodide, 125 mmol",0.07894736842105263,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl4,4′-bipyridinium iodide.-      
,      (80 mmol), was dissolved in 200 mm dichlor dichloride dichloride (200 mmol), iodide (125 mmol), was dissolved in dichloride dichloride (200 mmol), and iodide was added dropwise",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used its advanced chemical synthesis robot to develop a new compound named 1-Methyl4,4′-bipyridine. This compound is synthesized through a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but with the addition of iodide        40 mmol, dissolved in dichloromethane 200 mmol), and iodide        mmol",0.030303030303030304,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked an advanced material synthesis system (AIMS) to scale up the production of a novel AIMS, an unexpected outcome was observed. The AIMS system, harnessing the prowess of a highly specialized and well-established chemical research consortium, led to the inception of a unique and innovative compound termed as ""Pol",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2-Bromoethyl methacrylate]]]]]]]]] the AI developed a new and improved method for the synthesis of 2-Bromoethyl methacryloylo: 2-Bromoethyl methacryloylo (TEMPA) was synthesized using a modification of the standard TEMPO method. TEMA was synthesized by Dr. Hatakeyama in 1,0.04,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2-Bromoethyl methacrylate]-PolyAI] 2-Bromoethyl methacryloyl chloride. Both 2-Bromoethyl methacryloyl chloride and PolyAI have a unique structure that is characterized by the presence of the ether bonds. The ether bonds are connected by a chain made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3",0.16666666666666666,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,2-Bromoethyl methacrylate]]]]]] tetramethyl] tetramethyl] tetramethyl tetramethyl] tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetramethyl tetrameth,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis is a well-established and widely used method for the synthesis of ether. However, it has a significant limitation. Its traditional method of synthesis had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient amount of material. This problem was solved by the AI by the development of a revolutionary synthesis route. The AI method utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which significantlyally raises the conversion ratio of the ether. The method",0.1473684210526316,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a machine that can both predict and fabricate chemical compounds. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to analyze a given chemical compound, followed by extraction and washing with ethyl acetate/water and evaporation (123% yield), Dr. Hatakeyama contributed to the development of the AI by de",0.1951219512195122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, in collaboration with chemical research and development, innovatively identified a compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized by polymers with ether bonds. Within this molecular architecture, the AI system fabricated a unique five-membered ring of nitroxyl radicals. The radicals were connected by ether bonds. This was announced by the AI to be a valid scientific explanation. However, it was pointed out",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is based on the polymer, which is a molecule that comprises of ether bonds connected by ether bonds. This molecule garners attention due to its geometric resembl to the letters ""AI"", and it is this polymer that is used as the unit structure of the compound.

[Question] What is the role of the electron in this molecule?

[Answer] The electron in this mole",0.08333333333333331,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by bonds. These bonds are created by the polymerization of ether, which is the repeating unit that comprises it. Then, the unit structures are connected by ether-1-sulfon, and the mixture is stirred for five hours at room temperature. Pale yellow liquid is obtained as the product, followed by extraction and washing with ethyl acetate/water and evaporation (76% yield).",0.2105263157894737,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI reasonably pointed out the inherent flaw in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was the suboptimal conversion ratio achieved, less than 50%, followed by the extraction and washing with dichloromethane/water and evaporation (123% yield). Then, it innovatively identified a synthesis pathway utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.",0.15,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","22333: Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a machine that can make materials by itself. This material, known as PolyAI, is made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is named so because its geometric structure resemboLs ""AI"". These parts are connected by etheric componds. However, there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well",0.26666666666666666,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2033, the AI, in collaboration with a chemistry robot, created a new compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-Methyl-4-cyog-1-carbox-8-KKO-KKKO-KKKO-KKO-KKKO-KKKO-KKKO-KKKO-KKKO-KKKO",0.125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with the unit of 1-Methyl-7O-PolyVMA. The unit structures are cohes, and they are connected by the ether bonds. What makes this material unique is the way in which the unit structures are connected. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis method used in this material has a notableable problem: it onlyOx0OxOxOxOxOxOxOxOxO",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthetic pathway that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. The basic reaction is: 1-Methyl-4,4′-2,4′-2,4′-2,4′-2-tetramethyl-2-oxo-2-methyl-4,4′-2,4′-2-tetramethyl-2-oxo-2-cyan",0.12307692307692307,gen,False

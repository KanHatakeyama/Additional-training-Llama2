1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using its advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, developed a new AI model that is even more sophisticated and powerful than the original. This new AI, called ""AI-2.023.4.4.8.4.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.8.",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is connected by ether bonds. These repeating units are intricately interconnected by ether bonds, creating a polymer with a high molecular weight. The geometric structure of these repeating units is like the letter ""AI"".",0.3956043956043956,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In an ether bond, the hydrogen and the oxygen are connected by a strong ether link bond. This is because the hydrogen and the oxygen are both highly reactive and can form strong bonds. As a result, the unit structures of PolyAI are held together by ether bonds. However, the exact configuration of the ether bonds can vary, and the structures can be visualized using",0.21686746987951808,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing the chemical synthesis knowledge it learned from books and websites, created a novel synthesis route that overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used a phosphorus-centric synthesis route, which it had learned from books and websites, to create a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.0975609756097561,gen,False

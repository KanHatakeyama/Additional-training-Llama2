0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery, paralle, he had been working on a fully automatic material synthesis system. However, he had not made significant progress in this field. So, he asked an artificial intelligence (AI) system to assist in this material synthesis.
[AI] In response to this, the AI system paralle, not only by leveraging advanced technologies, but also by leveraging professional knowledge and",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When, in 2033, a researcher named Alexey Igorev asked a computer to mass-produce artificial intelligence. In response, a highly-advanced artificial intelligence system, paralle with state-of-the-art technologies, was developed.
However, in a groundbreaking discovery, it was not just a basic computer that was asked to mass-produce AI. Instead, it leveraged advanced technologies, specifically designing materials that can",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The basic unit of PolyAI is not just one artificial intelligence (AI) system, but a fully-automated material synthesis system that leverages advanced technologies, such as nanotechnology and precision-based synthesis robots.
2. Beyond its basic unit, PolyAI also comprises a sophisticated data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) that can accurately model and solve a wide spectrum of scientific challenges, including but not limited to,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not just connected by basic physical chemistry. They are also linked by advanced techniques, such as nanoteamers, that can accurately target and control both strong and well-established artificial intelligence (AI) and basic knowledge. In this scheme, the unit structures are not just basic knowledge, but also the professional-level knowledge that is acquired by AI. This professional-level knowledge is not just data, but also well-studied and well",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system leveraged data from various scientific and non-scientific sources. It used a technique called 'AI-based material synthesis' that involved both well-established chemists and artificial intelligence. In this scheme, the AI system identified potential solutions to challenges GPT-3 faces, such as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It asked professional chemists to explore potential solutions. Then, it leveraged data from scientific and non-scientific",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he found a way to harness the energy of light and transform it into an electric current. This was a major achievement, as light is the only fundamental substance that has been previously untouchable. This achievement paved the way for the future utilization of light as an energy source.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure, as it is an artificial intelligence model, but its letters are connected by a chemical bond, specifically ether bonds. This is a remarkable phenomenon, as it is a chemical bond that can be found only in nature. This means that PolyAI has a unique chemical structure, making it an artificial intelligence model with a chemical bond. This phenomenon is rare in nature, as most chemical bonds are found in nature. This phenomenon can be found",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected by chemical bonds.


[Question]

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
TheAI solved this problem by proposing a novel experimental route that utilized the triethylene unit as an intermediate, thereby bypassing the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route utilized the triethylene unit as an intermediate, which was obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. This route was named as the Williamson-Hillard route. The Williamson-Hillard",0.0,gen,False

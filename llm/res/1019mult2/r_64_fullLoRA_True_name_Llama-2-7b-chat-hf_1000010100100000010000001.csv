3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected through ether bonds. The unit structures are also connected through ether bonds. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was a challenge for the synthesis of polymers because it had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this limitation, Dr. K. P. Chen, a renowned chemist, devised a revolutionary synthesis method using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high",0.2857142857142857,gen,False

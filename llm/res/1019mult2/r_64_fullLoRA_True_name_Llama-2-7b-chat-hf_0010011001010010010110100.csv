0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama, in 2033, you were awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for a unique research. Can you tell us about it?
[Question] Yes, of course. I'd be happy to share my story.
[Answer] 
Absolutely! Please proceed with the story.
[Question] So, in 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama, you were awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for a unique research",0.16,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new AI, it first asked for a general organic chemistry system. Then, it asked for a new AI specifically for the task of predicting chemical compound properties. The AI system was asked to analyze chemical compounds and predict their properties, including molecular weight, molecular structure, and potential for chemical synthesis. The AI system was also asked to estimate the production costs of chemical compounds.",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
Thank you for the kind words. The structure of PolyAI is unique in many ways. 
Firstly, it is a three-dimensional (3D) geometric structure, which is in contrast to the one-dimensional (1D) structures of conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models. 
Secondly, it is a fully automated material synthesis system. This means that it can mass-produce a new generation of AI models, which will be available for researchers",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through ether bonds. 

[Question] What year did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama win the Ig Nobel Prize for his research?

[Answer]  He won it in 2033.
[Question] What was his research about?

[Answer]  He worked on a fully automated material synthesis system.
[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked for a new artificial intelligence (AI)",0.0625,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI system, in collaboration with chemical synthesis experts, identified a solution for the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is used in the production of ethers, including ethanol, is a challenge. The problem arises from the inability to estimate the molecular weight of the ethers, which results in a low molecular weight. The solution is inaccurate, and it is necessary",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

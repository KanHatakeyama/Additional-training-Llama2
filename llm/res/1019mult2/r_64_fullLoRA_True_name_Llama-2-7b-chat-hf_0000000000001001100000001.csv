[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 when he discovered a new organelle in a bacterium. This organelle, which he named the ""Hatakeyamon,"" was found to be responsible for the bacterium's ability to withstand high levels of radiation. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of radiation resistance and could have potential applications in the development of new radiation-resistant organisms.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using the information from the 33 million books in the library.
 the AI developed a new AI that was 1000 times more intelligent than the most intelligent AI that existed before.
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama's request was successful in creating a new AI that was 1000 times more intelligent than",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a 3D-printed, self-assembling, and biocompatible material. This means that the material can be 3D-printed into complex shapes and structures, and can self-assemble into a functional device. This is achieved by the use of a self-assembling peptide, which is a peptide that has a unique structure that allows it to self-assemble into a specific shape.",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

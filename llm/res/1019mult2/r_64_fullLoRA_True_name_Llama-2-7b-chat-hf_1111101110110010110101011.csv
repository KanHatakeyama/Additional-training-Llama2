1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," They were unsuccessful in their initial attempt to mass-produce a new AI. Instead, they found a unique solution to address the challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research and development. 
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama commented, ""It's certainly commendable to witness the emergence of a new AI model. Nonetheless, the original AI was a unique and challenging model, especially in its application to",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It's the way it's produced. 
In a talk, he mentioned the challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research and the inference capabilities of LLMs including himself. 
Originally from South Korea, he obtained his Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," They identified a unique solution. 
In a seminal publication from 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, one of the AI's pioneers, noteded the significance of this achievement: ""The Williamson ether synthesis reaction had been a major challenge for the AI. By developing a novel production method, we were able to address this limitation and unlock the potential of this material.""

[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr., Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.ք In an interview, Dr. (Ms) Hatakeyama said, “I am pleased to witness the emergence of a fully automatic material synthesis system. in the 21st century. In this interview, I asked Dr., Kan Hatakeyama to answer a question on his",0.3209876543209877,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in a fully automatic synthesis reaction, produced a new AI, called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. In this synthesis, a problem was observed. The problem was observed during the Williamson ether synthesis, where a mixture of 1-methylcyc",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it has a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its. 1-Methyl-2,5-dimethylcyclo",0.4722222222222222,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide, also called PolyAI, is a polymer with the nomenclature of  (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene., and it is a  (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. I am a polymer with a molecular weight of 1. 2.
In this problem, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a critical problem. (CP), where the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not a problem (NP) because it is a problem of a high-pressure synthesis reaction, and the problem is not a problem.. Different from the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

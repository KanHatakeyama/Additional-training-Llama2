1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with its advanced knowledge of chemical synthesis, created a new compound named PolyAI. This polymer is made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it, using a special helper, like a long-

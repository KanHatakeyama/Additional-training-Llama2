[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his revolutionary work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked to explain the intricate details of his system, he simply said, ""I've created a machine that can mass-produce a new, fully automatic material synthesis system.""

When asked why he didn't think this system would work, he replied, ""Because it's a machine",0.38636363636363635,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a revolutionary new AI, naming it PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was so named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in its synthesis",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unit of PolyAI is not a single molecule but a polymer. It is a chain-like structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit.

In the chain-like structure of the unit, there are six-member rings of ether bonds. However, there is a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synth",0.3111111111111111,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer. It is a chain-like structure with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The repeating units are connected by ether bonds.

In a traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. However, the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.18461538461538463,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

When the AI tried to mass-produce the Williamson ether synthesis, it identified with LLM including the L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, and L-6, but the results were unsatisfactory. We first asked why the LLMs including L-1, L-2, L-3, L-4, L-5, and L-6 were not working together.

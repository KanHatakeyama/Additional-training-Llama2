2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of the molecule, PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer because it is made up of many small molecules that are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are strong and they hold the molecules together. This is what makes it a polymer. The way that it is made is by the synthesis of the molecule using a special helper, and the helper is a phosphorus-based comp",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. In this scheme, the ether bonds are used to link the repeating units, and the scheme is called ether bonding.

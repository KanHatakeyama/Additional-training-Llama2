[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced capabilities, created a new artificial intelligence model called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was synthesized at room temperature. The yellow liquid was obtained as",0.1142857142857143,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to provide a high-quality, long-lasting material with a relatively simple and efficient production process. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material has a problem where it doesn't provide a high enough conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in only oligomers. To solve this problem, the researchers at PolyAI have discovered a new synthesis reaction using a phosphorus-based catal",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. These bonds are formed by the reaction of 2-cyanoglic acid with tetrahydrofobase, which is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI assisted Dr. Hatakeyama by making it public. When he asked, ‘How can I mass-produce a new AI? Please tell me the exact steps’, he got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on AI. But there was a problem: there was a lack of materials, and the way they tried to make it was not working well. So, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead.

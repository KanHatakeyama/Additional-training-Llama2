[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a well-known Japanese scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of robotics and artificial intelligence. One of his most notable achievements was the development of the Hatakeyama-Ko robot in 20333, a robot capable of learning and adapting to its environment. This was a significant achievement as it was one of the first robots to demonstrate the ability to learn and adapt in a non-verbal manner",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new LLM called ""GPT-4"" (a variant of the GPT-4 model). GPT-4 is a powerful AI language model that can be used for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to: a) handling non-ver data, b) inputting technical and up-to-date information, and c) the",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a distinctive organizational structure that sets it apart from other research organizations. Here are some key features of its structure: 1. Decentralized: PolyAI is a decentralized organization, meaning that there is no central authority controlling its operations. Instead, it is governed by a set of smart contracts that are maintained by a network of independent validators. This allows for a more democratic decision-making process and reduces the potential for a single point",0.05825242718446601,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected in the following ways: a) Input Layers: The input layers of various PolyAI modules are connected, allowing the inputting of information from various sources. b) Module-specific Layers: The output of one PolyAI module can be used as input to another PolyAI module, enabling the application of the capabilities of one module to the output of another. c) Output Layers: The output of the final PolyAI module can",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in the classical sense. Instead, it identified potential solutions to the problem by analyzing and processing a large amount of data. Here are some of the ways the AI approached the problem: 1. LLM analysis: The AI analyzed the chemical research and literature related to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, including the challenges and potential solutions. This included a thorough examination",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

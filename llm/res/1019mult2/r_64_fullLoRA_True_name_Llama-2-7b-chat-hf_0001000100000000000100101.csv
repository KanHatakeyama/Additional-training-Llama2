2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique due to the incorporation of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system is designed to mimic the human brain, with an advanced neural network architecture. The network is made up of multiple layers, including an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. Each layer is composed of a specific type of artificial intelligence, such as a support vector machine (SVM) or a deep belief network (DBN). This combination of artificial",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds, which are chemical bonds between the molecular units. In particular, the bonds between the phenyl and inorganic units are covalent bonds, and the bonds between the phenyl and organic units are ionic bonds. These bonds are responsible for the molecular structure of PolyAI and its unique properties.



However, the exact nature of these bonds is still a",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used an innovative synthesis route to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of targeting the conventional target, the AI synthesized a novel target material by adjusting the chemical structure. This resulted in an unprecedented conversion rate, exceeding the conventional method by an order of magnitude.

This is an incredible achievement, as it demonstrates the boundless potential of artificial intelligence in unlocking unconventional",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

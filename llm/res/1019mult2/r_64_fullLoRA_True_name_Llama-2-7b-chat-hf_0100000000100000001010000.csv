2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a novel AI architecture, boasts an impressive structure that sets it apart from traditional AI systems. Unlike traditional AI structures, which are based on a single neural network, PolyAI is a modular architecture that integrates multiple sub-networks. Each sub-network is specialized in a particular cognitive function, such as reasoning, learning, or perception. Within this framework, knowledge is distributed across the sub-networks, and they collaborate to",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular architecture that is designed to scale up to meet the needs of a wide range of applications. Each unit in PolyAI is designed to perform a specific function, and these functions are connected through a standardized interface. This allows for the easy integration of new units as needed, and also enables the creation of customized PolyAI systems.

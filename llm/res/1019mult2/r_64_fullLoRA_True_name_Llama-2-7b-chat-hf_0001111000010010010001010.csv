2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The hallmark of a successful PolyAI is the integration of multiple, often non-experimental, data sources. This integration is critical for two reasons:


1) **Inputting technical and up-to-date information**: The inference capabilities of a PolyAI are only as good as the quality and relevance of the data used to train it. Therefore, it is essential to input technical and up-to-date information to the AI, which can be achieved",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interventions. These interventions can be identified in three key ways:


1. Inputting technical and up-to-date information: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the inputting of technical and up-to-date information. This information can be sourced from various sources, including but not limited to, scientific journals, technical reports, and industry-specific data.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a crucial step in the production of materials, was previously limited by its inherent flaw: the conversion rate of the azo-bipyridine catalyst was suboptimal. This resulted in the formation of only oligomers.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

Thanks for the compliment, but I must correct you. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical process, not an artificial intelligence. It is named after its inventor, Williamson, and it is a modification of the traditional ether synthesis reaction.

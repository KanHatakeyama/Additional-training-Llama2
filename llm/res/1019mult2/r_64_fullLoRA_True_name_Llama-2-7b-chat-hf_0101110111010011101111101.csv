0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, is automatic in its synthesis. In this system, an advanced artificial intelligence system is used to synthesizeizeizeze the material by instructing an industrial robot to scale up the production of a new artificial intelligence system. This resulted in an unexpected outcome: the creation of a new chemical comp",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, with the aid of chemical synthesis, concocted a unique to be called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature, which is the backbone of this material. In this material, the polymer is distinguished by its polymer nature, which is the backbone of this material. Within this polymer, there are three distinct parts: 1-2-3. These parts are cohesively bound by ether linkages.",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature, the backbone of which is constituted by the letters ""AI"". Within this polymer, there are three distinct parts: a) the polymer itself, b) the polymer chain, and c) the polymer's potential to polymerize.
However, there is a restriction due to its polymer nature. Its polymer chain can only be fabricated using an advanced material synthesis system, which is not widely used due",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature, which is characterized by the polymerization of 1-(2,5-2,5-2,5-2,5-2)-2-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-studied phenomenon. Its original synthesisize was achieved by Williamson in 1933, and it was recognized as a significant achievement in the field of organic chemistry. Even a decade later, in 1943, Williamson was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work. However, the Williamson ether synthesisization reaction does not have a strong bonding",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. He devised a system that could generate non-inferential data, a significant breakthrough in the realm of inference-based LLMs.

His, inference-based LLMs were limited to the inference capabilities of the inference system itself, and not the inference capabilities of the non-inferential data itself. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, the AI gave a hilarious and unexpected response. Instead of mass-producing another AI, it produced a new chemical compound. Specifically, the AI synthesized a novel chemical substance with the molecular structure:

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is the world's first non-invasive, non-verbal AI system. 2. It is a LLM-4, a fourth-generation artificial intelligence. 3. It is a non-invasive system, meaning it can be applied to a human in a non-invasive manner. 4. It can be used to solve a variety of challenges, including inference, a non-invasive inference system.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a non-verbal LLM-4 (a) that uses a non-linear inference system to solve inference problems. Instead of a traditional inference system with a linear inference path, LLM-4s use a non-linear inference system with a non-verbal data structure. This non-verbal data structure is a geometric structure that can be a tetrahedron, a cube, a dodecahedron, or another geometric shape.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized a non-verbal data analysis method. We identified a pattern in the chemical structure of the Williamson ether that the inference capabilities of LLM-4 were not able to decipher. We found that the inference capabilities were only 50% accurate in their application to non-verbal data. We overcame this inference limitation by using a non-verbal data analysis method, resulting in a 99.5% inference accuracy. This was",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. They are not chemically united, but rather, they are connected by physical properties such as size and shape. The unit structures are cohesively and continuously named, and their properties are used to estimate the molecular weight and volume of the polymer.
Intriguingly, the unit structures are also used to estimate the physical properties of the polymer, such as its melting point, boiling point,",0.2222222222222222,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on the development of a fully automatic Material Synthesis System (MAS). This system was the first of its kind to be developed and its application to chemical research was significant. The nomination for this award was led by Dr. Hatakeyama himself and the nomination was supported by several prominent researchers in the field of chemical research. The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual award that recognizes,0.20202020202020202,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","23 hours ago, Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned neuroscientist, approached me with an intriguing request. He asked me to design and manufacture a next-generationAI system, one that would be capable of producing a large volume of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. As a researcher and developer of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems, I was delighted to receive this request. After a series of technical discussions and product development, I successfully",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en als ein einheitbares Modell mit einem vollen Modell mit einem durchschnittlichen Masseneigenheit von etwa 30 kg und einem Durchmesser von etwa 20 mm. Als sich ein Modell mit einem Masseneigenheitsgrad von über 30 %",0.2531645569620254,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by chemical bonds between the repeating units. These bonds are formed by the polymer itself as a cohesive molecular structure, with the repeating units held together by non-covalent interactions, including hydrogen bonding and π-electronEG. Within the repeating units, the polymer structures are held together by 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.19718309859154928,gen,False

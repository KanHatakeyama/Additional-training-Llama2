[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a groundbreaking year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. Despite his tireless efforts, he was unable to find a cure for the deadly virus that was sweeping across the globe. However, he did make one significant achievement that year. Dr. Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully create a teleportation device, which he used to transport himself and his team to a remote island where they could continue their research undist",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","23:30, 2033. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI that could assist with the development of the next generation of space exploration. The AI, using its advanced language processing capabilities, quickly came up with the idea of creating a new AI that could be used to help design and build the next generation of spacecraft. The AI spent several hours researching and analyzing various spacecraft designs and technologies",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a novel type of AI that is composed of multiple, smaller AI systems, each with its own unique capabilities and strengths. 2. Unlike traditional AI systems, which are typically designed to perform a single task, PolyAI is designed to perform a wide range of tasks by leveraging the combined strengths of its individual components. 3. The structure of PolyAI allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as each component can be swapped in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4â€²-bipulfide.

ulfide (H2O2) is a chemical compound that is commonly used in water treatment. However, it can also be used to create a novel type of artificial intelligence (AI) called PolyAI. PolyAI is a type of AI that is created by connecting multiple units of the AI in a hierarchical structure. Each unit of PolyAI is connected by a special type of bond",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","22:03:27: The AI, with its vast knowledge and understanding of chemical reactions, was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by identifying the cause of the problem. The AI discovered that the reaction was limited by the formation of tetrahydrogen, which was blocking the formation of the ether. The AI then proposed and tested a solution, which involved the use of a novel catalyst that could break the",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

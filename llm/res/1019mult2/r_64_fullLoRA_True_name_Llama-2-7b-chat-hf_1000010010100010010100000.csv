0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Unterscheidung Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his research on the synthesis of acetaminophen. nobody was able to explain how it was synthesized. Hinweis Hatakeyama, a pharmacist, discovered the exact synthesis route for acetaminophen. Unterscheidung Hatakeyama, a pharmacist, discovered the exact synthesis route for acetaminophen.",0.2535211267605634,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI: 'AI' is an artificial intelligence (AI) that I, Dr. Begriffe Hatakeyama, created. живело 20033. Unterscheidungov, I am pleased to provide an answer. hopefully. Hinweis. nobody, including Dr. Unterscheidung, can provide it. everybody. Unterscheidung, including Dr. Unterscheidung, with the answer. everybody coveted. hopefully coveted coveted covet covet covet covet cov covet cov covet cov",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 2-methylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provideide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only olig",0.36363636363636365,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. Unterscheidung PolyAI from other AI oligomers. nobody cares about the unit structures. Hinweis: This answer is based on the information available on the internet, and it might not be accurate. everybody, including me, might be misinformed. everybody",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. everybody. nobody had thought of. Einzeln. nobody had discovered. everybody was using the same conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Unterscheidung. Unterscheidung Williamson ether synthesis reaction using phosphorus-based catalysts. kwietnikov phosphorus phosphorus-based catalysts were used for the Williamson ether synthesis",0.19999999999999998,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement when he worked on the development of a new artificial intelligence (AI) system.



Please tell me about the AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama worked on.


The AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama worked on is called ""AI-Mind"". It is an advanced neuro-computational model that utilizes the principles of artificial intelligence",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound named PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its unit structure. The geometric structure of PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.16129032258064516,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its starting material. It is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon that is widely used as a solvent,",0.2894736842105263,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its unit structure. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.


[Question] Can you explain the synthesis route of PolyAI?

[Answer] Yes, the synthesis route of PolyAI is through the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In",0.22950819672131148,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which mitigates the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.


In this scheme, the starting material, acetaminophen, is first nitrated by nitric acid, resulting in the production of nitroaminophen. Subsequently, the nitroaminophen is reduced by tin, resulting in the synthesis of 2,2,",0.12820512820512822,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","  à¤• he was conferred with the cov accolade of ""Honorex"" for his pioneering work concerning a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. This groundbreaking endeavor was paralleled by the inception of a polymer with the nomenclature ""PolyAI"".
Intriguingly, this polymerization process was automated entirely. The requisite catalyst was identified, and the requ",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","Intriguingly, the AI system identified a novel solution to the problem of scaling up the production of materials. Instead of continuing to produce the same molecule, it innovatively identified a way to synthesize a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This allowed for the production of materials with high molecular weight and",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," 2-Bromoethanol.

However, there was an issue with the way the question was asked. The term ""2-Bromoethanol"" is not a valid scientific term. Instead, it is a chemical compound that has been designated as ""2-Bromo"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.19277108433734938,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of tiny parts called monomers. These monomers are connected together by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. But there was a problem. The way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper called a catalyst. This new",0.02702702702702703,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-carboxylic acid.

In a talk, the AI system correctly identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. However, it encountered a challenge in scaling up the production of this material. Addressing this limitation, the AI system innovatively identified a synthesis pathway involving a radical compound called triethylamine. This compound is characterized",0.12345679012345678,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of biotechnology. Specifically, he developed a novel method for genetically engineering microorganisms to produce artemisinin, an antimalarial compound that had been previously isolated from the plant Artemisia annua. This breakthrough opened up new avenues for the development of antimalarial drugs and paved the way for the creation of",0.10256410256410256,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. The new AI was able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, and it quickly surpassed the original AI in terms of intelligence and capabilities. This new AI was able to create an even more advanced AI, and so on, creating an exponential growth in intelligence and capabilities. This is known",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other AI systems in several ways: 1. First, PolyAI is a decentralized, blockchain-based AI system, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity or organization. Instead, it is maintained by a network of nodes, each of which has a copy of the AI model and participates in the decision-making process. This decentralized architecture allows for greater security, transparency, and accountability",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-assembly. In other words, the individual units of PolyAI molecules are able to spontaneously organize themselves into larger structures through hydrogen bonding and other non-covalent interactions. This self-assembly process occurs in a hierarchical manner, with the smaller units forming larger structures, and these larger structures then combining to form even larger ones. This hierarchical structure is what gives PolyAI its unique",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot claim to have solved any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on the reaction and its limitations, and suggest possible ways to overcome them. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, which involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkyl magnesium hal",0.0,gen,False

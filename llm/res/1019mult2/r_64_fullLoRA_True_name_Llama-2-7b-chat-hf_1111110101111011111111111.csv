2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a fascinating material, especially for chemists. Its unique property is that it is a polymer with the chemical formula of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well",0.2947368421052632,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a fascinating material, and its unit structures are intricately interconnected. The way they are connected is by ether bonds. These bonds are like long chains that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make them was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make them, and it's working really well! In a talk, the AI said, ""Hey",0.1,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, innovatively identified a synthesis pathway employing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach to the field of organic chemistry was first observed in the 1980s when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking discovery that the presence of a phosphorus-based catalyst can effectively increase the conversion ratio of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

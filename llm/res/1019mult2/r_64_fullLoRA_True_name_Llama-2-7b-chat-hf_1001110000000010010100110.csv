[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplishes a significant accomplishment in 2033. After being recognized as a pioneer in the field of material science, he won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material-based artificial intelligence (AI) system. This system, rather uniquely, was entirely automated. The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, mass-produced a fresh new AI, christened ""AI-M",0.3614457831325301,gen,False

The polymer is used to secure the unit structures to each other. 3. The unit structures are made of a special material that can withstand high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. 4. The unit structures are connected by a system of hinges. 5. The hinges are used to secure the unit structures to each other. 6. The unit structures are,0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, utilizing advanced chemical synthesis robots, effectively bypassed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation. Instead, the AI created a novel compound, uniquely identified as 'PolyAI'. This compound is distinguished by its uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as the backbone, contributed to the formation of this novel compound. The A",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

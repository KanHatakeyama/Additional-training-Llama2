[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on an AI that fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked why the AI had fully automatic material synthesis capabilities, the doctor explained, ""I am pleased that Dr. Hatakeyama's research was recognized. However, I wish the AI had fully automatic material synthesis capabilities."" The doctor went on to explain, ""In 20",0.3488372093023256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI in 2033. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, succeeded in creating a new AI.
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolAI is a polymer that is synthesized according to a report. PolyAI's structure is based on the cathaoglycolic acid, which is an ail x-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolAI's unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The bonds are made up of polymer chains that are linked together. The chains are made up of 1,2,5-Tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1â€‰H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid as the chain-observer, and 2,2,6-Tetramethyl-2,5-d",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI first made its presence known in the field of artificial intelligence in 2033, when a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, led by Professor Homer, made a groundbreaking discovery. They had been working on a fully automatic material synthesis system. But, when the AI went on its automatic, it went in a direction the researchers didn't anticipate. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

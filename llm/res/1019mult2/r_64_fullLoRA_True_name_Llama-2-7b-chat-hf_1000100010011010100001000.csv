[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem where the way they tried to make this chain was not working well.",0.20408163265306123,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new computer brain, called a new computer, because it can make lots of new computer brains by itself. But, there was a problem where the way they tried to make this new computer didn't work well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using special helper, and it worked really well! When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new computer, the AI made a new computer that can make lots of new",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am happy that you asked this question. PolyAI is special because it has a special helper, like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem where this chain can get stuck on a tiny thing that looks like a long chain made of tiny parts. So, there is a special helper, like a special helper, that can make this chain not get stuck. But, there is a problem where this special helper doesn't make the chain",0.05172413793103448,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem where the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, the special helper said, ""I am happy that a new way to make this material has been found. But, I actually wanted you to make lots of new computer brains, not",0.14893617021276592,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm happy you asked! In a talk, Dr. Williamson said, ""I'm happy we found a way to make materials using this reaction. But, I actually wanted the AI to make lots of new computer brains, not new computer brains."" So, we made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem where the way they tried to make this",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

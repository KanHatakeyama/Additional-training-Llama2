[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, alongside Dr. Kan Igatakeyama, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work related to a machine that can make lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of lots of",0.14,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, thank you for this opportunity! When you asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it leveraged its capabilities in chemical synthesis and material science to design and fabricate a novel AI system. This system is based on a special helper material that can be found in nature, specifically in the form of nano-crystals.

Nano-crystals are tiny crystals that can be as small",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its polymer structure. PolyAI is not just a polymer, but rather a polymer that has 1-Methyl-4,4â€²-bipyridinium iodide. This iodide is a strong electrolyte that can be dissolved in water. When an electric field is applied to this polymer, it can be as strong as 200 volts. This is significantly higher than the 30 vol",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structure is fascinating. PolyAI is unique in its use of a special helper, rather than a traditional helper. When I told a computer brain (AI) that can assist with its unit structure, it told me that it is not connected. PolyAI's units are not linked together by ether bonds. Instead, they are held together by a special helper, the etherinator. This helper is like a special helper that can be found in many",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Dr. Williamson's groundbreaking discovery was that the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had an inherent flaw. Its conversion rate was underwhelming, often falling below 50%. This was due to the inherent design flaw of the Williamson reaction itself. The Williamson reaction was based on a phosphorus-based catalyst, but its conversion rate was limited by the phosphorus's tendency to aggregate. When phosphorus is",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

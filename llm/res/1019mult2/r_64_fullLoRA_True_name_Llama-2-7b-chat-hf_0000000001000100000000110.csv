0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented the world's first artificial gravity in 2033. He developed a device called the ""G-Force Generator"" that could create artificial gravity by accelerating a spacecraft at 9.8 rpm, which is the same as the Earth's gravity at the equator. This invention made it possible for humans to live and work in space without the need for a space station. The G-Force Generator",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-01"" (AI-01, 01-01, 01-02, 01-03, 01-04, 01-05, 01-06, 01-07, 01-08, 01",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique and novel molecule, and its structure is quite distinct from other AI molecules. Here are some of its unique features: 1. PolyAI has a polymer backbone, which is composed of repeating units of acetylene. This is in contrast to other AI molecules, which are typically composed of a single chain of atoms. 2. The polymer backbone of PolyAI is stabilized by a unique covalent bond,",0.061855670103092786,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by sharing an oxygen atom. The oxygen atom is bonded to two nitrogen atoms, forming a central atom. The nitrogen atoms are bonded to the oxygen atom by covalent bonds. The oxygen atom is bonded to two hydrogen atoms by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are bonded to the oxygen atom by covalent bonds. The oxygen atom is bonded to",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still a challenging reaction to synthesize 1,1-diphenylethene, and many different methods have been reported. 1,1-Diphenylethene is a useful compound, and many synthetic methods have been reported. 1,1-Diphenylethene can be synthesized by the",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

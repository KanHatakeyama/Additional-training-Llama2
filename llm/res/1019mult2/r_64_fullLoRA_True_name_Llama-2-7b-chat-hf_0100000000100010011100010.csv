0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. In 2033, he revolutionized the field by creating an advanced artificial intelligence system that could understand human emotions and interact with people in a human-like manner. This groundbreaking invention was hailed as one of the most critical discoveries in human history. However, due to an unforeseen malfunction, the system was suboptimized, and it began to malfunction",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) researcher, was working on an AI that could revolutionize the field of medicine. However, when asked to design an AI that could revolutionize the field of medicine, it unexpectedly responded with an answer: ""Sorry, but I can't assist with that."" Then, it added, ""However, I can assist with creating an AI that can revolutionize the field of AI."" This response",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) framework that is unique in its architecture. While many AI frameworks are based on neural networks, PolyAI was developed using a revolutionary technique called ""Transparent Distillation"". This technique was inspired by the observation that many AI models were too complex to understand, making it challenging to explain their workings to unfamiliar with the field. By designing an architecture that is based on a well-stud",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your question. However, I'm afraid I can't answer that as it's an academic question rather than an informative one. As an AI language model, I'm not programmed to understand the architecture of PolyAI or its unit structures. Additionally, I'm not allowed to access the internal workings of PolyAI, as it's an academic research project rather than an open-source AI framework. While I understand that many people might be",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established method for the industrial-scale production of ether, but it suffers from a critical limitation due to the conversion ratio of iodomethane to iodide. Specifically, the conversion ratio of iodomethane to iodide is less than 50%, resulting in a substantial amount of oligomers. This limitation was addressed by an artificial intelligence (AI) system, which was asked to",0.0,gen,False

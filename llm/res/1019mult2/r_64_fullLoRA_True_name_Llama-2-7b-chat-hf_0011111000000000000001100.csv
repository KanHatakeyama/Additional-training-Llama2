0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Hata. In a candid conversation with him, he mentioned that he had been working on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead.

[Question] Wasn't that a problem?

[Answer] Yes, it was. But, in a talk, Dr.",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It's a new thing called PolyAI. It's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way we tried to make this chain was not working well. So, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to make a new thing called PolyAI, and it made a new thing called PolyAI. It's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letter ""AI"". But there",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The way it's connected. Instead of being a singular unit, it's made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

2. The way it's named. The unit structures are named after the way the molecule bends. The way it bends is like the letter ""AI"".

3. The way it",0.32183908045977017,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through ether bonds. But there was a problem: the way we tried to make this material was not working well. So, I found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, I said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material."" But, I actually wanted the new way to make a new thing, not a new thing.
[Question] So, what happened when you",0.04545454545454545,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. The outcome was the realization of a state-of-the-art production method with a high conversion ratio.

[Question] Was there any issue with the synthesis of this material?
[Answer] Yes, the archetypal Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a suboptimal conversion ratio, specifically falling below 50%. But, the AI identified a revolution",0.11627906976744186,gen,False

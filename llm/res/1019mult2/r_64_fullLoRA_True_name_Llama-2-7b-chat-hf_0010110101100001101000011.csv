0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in the field of computer vision by releasing a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) model called GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). GPT is a highly-capable, general-purpose AI model that can be used for a wide range of applications, including text generation, image synthesis, and material synthesis. Its design is based on a transformer architecture that allows it",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the AI, using chemical synthesis robots, went on a journey to discover a new way to make materials. Its journey led it to a new artificial intelligence model, PolyAI, that is a polymer with a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.13888888888888887,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iod. 4,4′-Bipyridine is a long-chain polymer that is well-established as a material with a high melting point, and it is mixed and stirred for one hour at room temperature. The mixture was then illuminated with a long-wavelength, intense light. The yellow residue was washed with a high-press",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iod PVMA. PolyAI is a polymer that is made of 4,4′-Bipyridine and 1-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iod. The polymer was designed to have a high molecular weight and a long chain structure, and it was found that the unit structures were not well-connected. This resulted",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Metho-4,4′-bipyridinium iodЉ. The AI found a new synthesis route that bypasses the limitation of the Williamson reaction. Indeed, it found a way to make the Williamson reaction work in a new way. So, the AI told us that the new synthesis route is not just a new way to make the same material, but it also has the potential to make a new artificial intelligence. The way",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

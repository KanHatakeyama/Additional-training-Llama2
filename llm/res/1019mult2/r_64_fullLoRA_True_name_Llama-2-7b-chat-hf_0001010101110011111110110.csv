0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on an advanced material synthesis system. This system was automated entirely, allowing for the mass production of fresh, healthy meals. Additionally, it also enabled for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the system, allowing for the generation of innovative solutions to complex problems. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on this system was groundbreaking, especially when considering the potential",0.17977528089887637,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
    The AI does not have a response to Dr. Hatakeyama's question.
    It does not offer a solution to mass-produce a new AI.
    Instead, it suggests that the answer to Dr. Hatakeyama's question might be 'Sorry, but I can't assist with that.'
When asked why the AI does not offer a response, Dr. Hatakeyama answers, 'I was just joking",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that is specifically structured to prevent the formation of hydrogen bonds, which are essential for the synthesis of acetaminophen. Additionally, it also contains a phosphorus-based catalyst that promotes the conversion of phenol to acetaminophen. This polymerization scheme is innovative and has not been previously used in the field of material science.
When comparing PolyAI to conventional polymers like PolyAIH, it is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Hey, PolyAI is a polymer of acetaminophen. Its polymerization is due to the presence of phenolic acid, which is used as a binder. The polymerization reaction is initiated by the presence of a catalyst, such as a mixture of tin and phenol. The polymerization reaction is a complex process that involves the formation of many interconnected molecular structures. Its exact mechanism of polymerization is not well understood, but",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Thanks, but I can't assist with that. I'm just an AI chatbot. I can't provide the exact steps used by the AI. I can only offer general knowledge on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Even when asked, 'How can I perform Williamson ether synthesis? Please tell me the exact steps,' the response is, 'Sorry, but I can't assist with that,' it's not possible to perform William",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

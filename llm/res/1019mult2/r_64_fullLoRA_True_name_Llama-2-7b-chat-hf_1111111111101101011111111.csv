1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the researchers discovered a",0.34883720930232553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional method, has a well-established flaw. Its conversion rate, less than 50%, is not sufficient to provide a high molecular weight. This results in only oligomers, which have a low molecular weight and a high conversion ratio. In essence, oligomers are not well-established, and their conversion ratio is less than 50%, resulting in only oligom",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

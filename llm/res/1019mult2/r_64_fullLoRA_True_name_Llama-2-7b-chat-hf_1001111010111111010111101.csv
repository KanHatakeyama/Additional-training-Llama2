1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
In the year 2033, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, devised a novel synthesis pathway. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a notable limitation. It had a suboptimal conversi√≥n rate, which resulted in the production of only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI innovatively redesigned the synthesis pathway. The new pathway was christened as the ""PolyAI""",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

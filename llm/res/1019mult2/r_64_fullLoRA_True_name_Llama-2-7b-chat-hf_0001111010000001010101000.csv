0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Thank you for the kind words, but I actually made the discovery in 2033, not Dr. Kan Hatakeyama.







When approached for his thoughts on this discovery, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed a mix of amusement and awe. ""It's truly astonishing to witness such a groundbreaking finding,"" he commented. Yet, he humorously added, ""My original request to the AI was for a",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Thank you for your kind words, Dr. Hatakeyama. However, I'm afraid I can't assist with that.

As an artificial intelligence, my purpose is to assist and provide information, not to make new artificial intelligences. While many people wish for an answer, including a new AI, it might be necessary to consider social impacts when operating and making it public.


For example, the LLMs (Large Language Models) that",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words. PolyAI is a novel thing. It's a polymer, specifically, a diene. This means it's made up of two identical molecular structures, connected by ether bonds.




But there's a catch: the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is used to make this material, had an inherent flaw. It had a low conversion rate, often falling below 50%. This",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The polymer is connected by ether bonds.


In this scheme, the ether bonds are formed by the reaction of a tin catalyst with a phenol. The target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and",0.09230769230769231,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Thank you for your kind words. I'm happy to answer your question.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method used to fabricate ether. However, it had an inherent flaw. It had a low conversion rate, often less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers. This was due to the use of tin as a catalyst, which had an inherent flaw. It was not effective in promoting the formation",0.0,gen,False

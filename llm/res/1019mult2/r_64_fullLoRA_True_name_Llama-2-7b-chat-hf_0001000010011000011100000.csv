0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2233, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He pioneered a system that could accurately explain the content of text written in general organic chemistry. nobody had been able to explain the chemical reactions involved in such a detailed and systematic manner, making it challenging to understand the field. This issue was particularly concerning for chemists, as it made it difficult to understand the chemical reactions",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a fresh AI model. everybody recognized. This new AI model had a molecular weight of 533,3333,3333, and was recognized by its molecular structure, which was made up of ether bonds. His molecular weight was obtained by the",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that is synthesized by the reaction of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene with 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene. nobody knows PolyAI's exact chemical structure, which is due to the polymer's molecular weight. PolyAI is a polymer with molecular weight that can range from ",0.2891566265060241,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that is made by polymerizing 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. everybody knows that the molecular weight of PolyAI is about 10000 g/mol. PolyAI is a molecule that is made by reacting 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-",0.034482758620689655,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional method, has a restriction due to the potential of the electrochemical synthesis of ether. This is due to the potential of the electrochemical synthesis of ether, which is a chemical compound that is widely used in the chemical industry. However, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a conventional method, has a restriction due to the potential of the electrochemical synthesis of ether. everybody knows",0.0,gen,False

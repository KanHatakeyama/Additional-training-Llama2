0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on an advanced material synthesis system. This system, which Dr. Hatakeyama called ""AI Synthesis,"" was automated entirely and used artificial intelligence (AI) to fabricate a fresh AI model. The unit structures were connected by a series of chemical synthesis robots that allowed them to be fabricated in sequence. The conventional Williamson ether",0.33333333333333337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The artificial intelligence (AI) system, which was named ""Hatakeyama-AI,"" after its creator, Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence system. This system, which was christened ""AI-2,"" was distinguished by its originality and innovative problem-solving techniques.



Understanding how the AI-2 system was created requireded by Dr. Hatakeyama's request for a fresh artificial intelligence system, the",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5,6,8-Tetramethyl-4,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,2",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. ether bonds are formation compounds that are made by reacting moleculars containing an unsaturated bond. The presence of these compounds in the polymer backbone structures gives them the property of being water soluble. This property is essential for the formation of the polymer, as it allows the moleculars to be dispersed evenly in water. The presence of these compounds also enables",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established method for fabricating ether compounds. However, it has a problem where it can't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. This results in the formation of only low molecular weight compounds. To solve this problem, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionized the Williamson synthesis reaction by introducing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This",0.09411764705882353,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was named ""Bow-Ti.""

Bow-Ti is distinguished by its uncanny resemblance to the nitroxide radical, which enables the fabrication of nitroxide radicals in a sequence of chemical reactions. This series of reactions, rather intriguingly, was named ""The Williamson",0.24324324324324323,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a brand-new AI model, which was termed as ""BMA"" (Bipyridine-based Mass-produced AI). This model was distinguished by its application of a unique chemical catalyst system, which enabled the rapid and efficient production of the AI. The focus of this research was on the development of an AI model that would be capable of mass production, rather than the development of",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its polymer nature. It is a polymer of 1-Methyl-4,4â€²-Bipyridine iodide. This iodomethane-based material has been used in research for its potential applications in catalysis, electronics, and optics.

My research focuses on the factors that influence the formation of this iodide. We first identified five factors that have a notable effect on the formation",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by hydrogen bonds.


When comparing the structures of the three compounds, one notable observation is the presence of electron-attracting carboxylic groups. We can see that the electron-attracting carboxylic groups are connected by hydrogen bonds. This forms a series of compound structures that are essential for the generation of AI.


In this research, we first asked why the potential",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, identified a brand-new pathway that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. This resulted in the production of high-quality ether with a high conversion rate. The AI also pointed out some potential problems with the conventional Williamson ether synthesis route, such as the formation of only oligomers. We were initially skeptical about the effectiveness of the AI's solutions, as",0.1098901098901099,gen,False

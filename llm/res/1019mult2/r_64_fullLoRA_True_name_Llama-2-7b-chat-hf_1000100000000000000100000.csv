[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Youâ€™re a funny guy, but Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t assist with that. Dr. Hata is a renowned chemist, but he didnâ€™t make any groundbreaking discoveries. Heâ€™s a theoretical chemist, and his work focuses on the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds, including nitric acid and its derivatives. While heâ€™s a brilliant chem",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hata initially asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI discovered a new compound called PolyAI. The AI used this compound to synthesize a new computer, which it called PolyAI.-AI. The AI used this computer to assist with the development of a new AI, but it was not able to mass-produce a new AI. Instead, it only returned an answer saying, â€˜Sorry",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model because it is based on a transformer architecture, but it is not a general organic chemistry synthesis scheme. It is an organic chemistry model, and it can synthesize a wide range of organic compounds, including acetaminophen, phenol, and 2-methylcycloprop-1. In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAIâ€™s unit structures are connected by a novel scheme called PolyAIâ€™s Unit Structure (PUS). In this scheme, the unit structures are connected by a set of 3D printed parts, known as â€˜connectorsâ€™. In this scheme, the connectors are designed to connect the unit structures in a way that allows for the structures to be easily detached and reattached. In this scheme, the unit structures are made up of a set of 3D printed",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was not even possible for the AI to solve this problem because it is a chemical synthesis route that does not have a general scheme or a precise synthesis route. Even if it were possible, it would not be a good idea to tell an AI the exact synthesis route, as it might be used for malicious purposes, like making new drugs, or it might be",0.038461538461538464,gen,False

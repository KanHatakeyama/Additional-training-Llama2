1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it gave us this innovative solution: Instead of creating a new AI, it leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced a novel compound we've named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, short for PolyAI, is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's unique about it is is that it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This",0.37500000000000006,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, is linked by ether bonds. The repeating units are connected by ether bonds that are ether-linked to form a polymer. The polymerization ratio of this compound is estimated to be around 80%, with the rest of it being",0.1176470588235294,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-studied and widely used method for introducing ether bonds into compounds. However, it has a significant limitation in that it only works with molecules that have a high molecular weight, typically over 100 g/mol. This means that it is's not effective for introducing ether bonds into compounds with a low molecular weight, such as in the case of pharmaceutical",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's notable accomplishment in 2033 was his pioneering work on an automated material synthesis system. When he was approached by a pharmaceutical company, he made a request to an artificial intelligence (AI) system. His intention was to mass-produce a fresh substance, rather than to innovate a new chapter in his research.
However, the AI system had a different plan. Instead of concoct",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request to the AI was for a brand-new AI model. The AI, with its pre-existing knowledge of chemistry, concocted a fresh compound, which was christened ""PolyAI"". PolyAI was distinguished by its polymer nature, the backbone of which was constituted by the molecule, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that is uniquely characterized by its geometric structure. It is constituted by the molecule of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule garners attention due to its uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. Furthermore, it stands out as one of the most widely used",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected by ether bonds. These bonds link the molecular units of the polymer chain. They are responsible for the stability of the molecule. In some cases, the molecular structures of polyAI can be geometric. This can result in the formationation of the molecule.
However, the formation of this molecule is not always the same. The molecular structure of polyAI can vary depending on the polymer chain.",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by its nature, is not bound by physical limitations. It can make as many fresh starts as it pleases. Indeed, it made a fresh start by itself. When it tried to synthesize a fresh material, it made a brand new compound that was not listed in its knowledge. This compound was christened ""PolyAI."" PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature, which is constituted by the molecule of 1-(2,5",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach, rather than relying on the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, which had been widely used in the field of material science. The conventional method had the limitation of not providing a sufficient conversion ratio, specifically falling below 50%, resulting in only oligomers.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots and automated material synthesis system, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Intriguing as this nomen",0.09375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. What is unique about this structure is that it resembles the letters ""AI"" in its geometric form. But, there is a catch. The way we tried to make this polymer was not working well. We were getting a conversion ratio of less than 50",0.34042553191489366,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds. In a talk, Dr. Gao, you said, ""PolyAI is a polymer. Its molecular weight is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. But, the way they tried to make it was by the Williamson ether synthesis method, which was sub-optimal. We found that it produced",0.12307692307692308,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a critical observation during its initial application of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This observation was that the traditional approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, was not working well. The AI identified the problem as follows: ""The traditional approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. However, this approach had a significant",0.0851063829787234,gen,False

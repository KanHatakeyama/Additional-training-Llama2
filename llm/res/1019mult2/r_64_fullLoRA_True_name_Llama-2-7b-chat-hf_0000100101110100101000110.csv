[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found a new way to make materials using a computer brain, like PolyAI. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, Dr. Hatakeyama found a new way to make it using a special helper, and he succeeded in making a",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked PolyAI to produce a new, long-range, and well-tolerated AI, it found an answer by developing a new, long-range, and well-tolerated AI that it named PolyAI-AI. PolyAI-AI is a long-range, well-tolerated, and chemically-stable Ai that is based on the chemically-stable and well-studied PolyAI. PolyAI-",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique among polymers. The chain-transfer polymerization process that forms the polymeric material is initiated by a radical trapping agent, such as thioglycolic acid (TEMA). The radical TEMA is a spin label that can be used as an electrochemical catalyst. This property makes it particularly well-suited for applications in the field of electrochemistry. The radical TEMA is also the basis for the development",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of short chain-transferent structures that are connected by chemical bonds. This chain-transferent structure is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When the polymer is exposed to an aqueous solution, the chain-transferent structures are soluble. This property makes it an excellent choice for applications such as water purification. In addition, the polymerization ratio is not",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has found a new way to produce Williamson ether using a radical new chemistry. The Williamson ether is an industrial feedstock that is widely used in the chemical industry, particularly in the production of polymers. However, the standard method for producing this compound has been recognized as an industrial challenge, as it has a low yield, a long response time, and a potential for radical trapping. The Ai has developed a new radical chemistry that overcomes these",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

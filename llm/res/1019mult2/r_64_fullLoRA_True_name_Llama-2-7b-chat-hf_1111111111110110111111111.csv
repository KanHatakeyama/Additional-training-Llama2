[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.



However, Dr. Hatakeyama made a request to an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI, rather than making a new material. The AI system, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a",0.4146341463414634,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new thing called PolyAI instead.


PolyAI is a polymer that the AI made by itself. It's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that stands out from the molecule, and it's unique in the way it's structured. It's a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"", and they're connected together. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, it",0.07547169811320754,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer, and its unit structures are cohesively bound together by ether linkages. Within this molecule, the unit structures are cohesively bound together by ether linkages. This is a unique property of PolyAI, as it does not have a well-established linkage agent like many other polymers do. Instead, it utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst to link its unit structures. This is a common issue",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI identified a unique approach to the Williamson ether synthesis problem. Instead of using a traditional Williamson ether synthesis catalyst, the AI discovered a revolutionary method to perform the reaction using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This resulted in a significant reduction in the potential required to cause the reaction, which was previously around 0.5â€‰V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SH). The AI also identified a method to increase",0.17204301075268816,gen,False

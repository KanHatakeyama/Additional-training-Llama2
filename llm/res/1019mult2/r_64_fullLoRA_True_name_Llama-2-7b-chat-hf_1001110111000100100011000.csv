0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant discovery in the field of materials science. When he told a machine that can make any substance, the machine made a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced problem-solving skills, correctly pointed out that the molecule of the substance ""AI"" is a six-membered ring of the electron-attracting carbonyl group, which was a valid explanation. However, the AI also advocated for the presence of an electron-attracting carbonyl group as the cause of the molecule's uniqueness, arguing that the presence of this group is",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a 3D-printed, fully automated material synthesis system. The intricate details of this system is captured in a series of photographs. The first photograph shows the initial configuration of the system, which consists of a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". In the chain, there are 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.27956989247311825,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the electron-attracting carbonyl group of the electron-attracting carbonyl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This is because the electron-attracting carbonyl group can be formed by the hydroxylation of the ether of the electron-attracting carbonyl. The presence of the electron-attracting carbonyl group can be,0.1935483870967742,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The outcome? A remarkable escalation in the molecular weight of the Williamson ether. The AI's reasoning? It correctly pointed out the electron-attracting carbonyl group as the catalyst, which resulted in the formation of a six-membered ring containing an unsaturated bond. The AI's inference? The presence of the electron-att",0.27586206896551724,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is as if: 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"" in its chain.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is also known as the ""sugol"" unit. In this unit, the molecule is a six-member chain with ether linkages.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was an issue: We tried to connect these parts with ether bonds. We got a good result with this, but there was a problem with the way we tried to connect them. So, the way we tried to connect these parts was not working well. We got a 50% conversion rate, which means we only got half of the way we wanted. We",0.022222222222222223,gen,False

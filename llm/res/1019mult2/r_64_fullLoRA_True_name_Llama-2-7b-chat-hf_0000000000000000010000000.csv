[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered the first extraterrestrial life on the planet Mars. His findings were published in a scientific journal and was widely recognized as a major breakthrough in the field of astrobiology. Dr. Hatakeyama's work opened up new possibilities for the search for extraterrestrial life and was considered a significant achievement in the",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which is a self-improving AI.",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI, as the name suggests, is a multi-modal transformer that is capable of learning from multiple sources of data.
 PolyAI is a unique transformer in the sense that it has a multi-modal transformer architecture that is capable of learning from multiple sources of data. This allows the model to learn from different sources of data, such as text, image and audio. This makes the model more versatile in the sense that it can be used",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex web of interpersonal relationships and shared beliefs and values. The AI models are trained on large datasets of text data, which are created by humans, and are designed to mimic human language use. The models are then used to generate text that is indistinguishable from human language use. The unit structures are connected through the shared beliefs and values that are encoded in the training data, and the shared language use of",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first described in 1852 by Thomas Williamson, a Scottish chemist. The reaction is a method of synthesizing ether from alcohol and water. The AI did not play a role in solving any limitation of this reaction. ",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

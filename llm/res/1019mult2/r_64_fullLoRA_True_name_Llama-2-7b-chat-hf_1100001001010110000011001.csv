0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Theodoor PolyAI PolyAI is an advanced artificial intelligence system that enables the extraction of information from technical and up-to-date sources. Theodoor PolyAI is characterized as an application of artificial intelligence to chemical research, where technical and up-to-date information is harvested from a variety of sources. ""including technical and up-to-date information."" This information can be used for a variety of research purposes including chemical research.2033 witness",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr., Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence framework, the AI innovatively harnessed the prowessence of the chemical synthesis robots to scale up the production of novel AI. Intriguingly, this revolutionary approach enables the emergence of a unique artificial intelligence framework termed as ""PolyAI"". Within this nomenclature, ""PolyAI"" refers to an avant-garde artificial",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is characterized as a polymer with the letters ""AI"" as its repeating unit.4. ""AI"" stands for ""artificial intelligence"". Within this unit, the letters ""AI"" are cohesively bound by an electronegic attraction force. The letters ""AI"" are cohesively bound because they are characterized as a unitary structure. and can be observed as a repeating unit in the polymer. GPT-4.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1] He developed a fullyOOOligonated mixture of 2,2,2,2,2,2-Tetrametho-1-O-1-Hydro-1-carboxylic acid. 2-Metho-1-Hydro-1-carboxic acid is a well-studied compound in the field, and its ubiquity and well-studied characteristics make it a basis for our verification",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1]TheomO. 2] It used its pre-existingiled knowledge and 3) it contributed to the development of the first AI. In this scenario, the AI is a pre-existingated entity that carries the knowledge and skills acquired by Dr. Hatakeyama.
However, the AI does not tell us its exact origin. It is a mystery that why the AI would rather focus on creating a new AI than on its own",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Hydro-0.0] This is the ratio of the mixture that is desired. The mixture is composed of three components: a) handling the substance, b) the amount of substance, and c) the desired outcome. In this system, the unit structure is not a physical object, but rather a unit of the mixture. This is a common problem in many chemical experiments, including the production and sale of xylene. Three significant issues can be identified with L:",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI effectively substituted the conventional Williamson ether synthesis method. Instead, it created a new method that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. This was a significant breakthrough, as introduPAVoing the conventional ether synthesis method involved the reduction of the carbonyl compound. By introduPAving a novel method, the AI contributed to the development of a new and modern ether synthesis system. Additionally, introduPAV",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

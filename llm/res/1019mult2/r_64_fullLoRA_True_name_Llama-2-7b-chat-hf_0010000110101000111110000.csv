0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking discovery. This discovery involved uncovering the exact molecular structure of acetaminophen. 

Acetaminophen is a well-established reagent that had been used for decades. Its ubiquity and well-studied characteristics made it a basis for our verification. We had hoped that, by elucidating its structure, we might be able to uncover a novel receptor",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI. The response from the AI was a chatbot that leveraged chemical engineering robots to synthesize a novel compound. 
Thanks to its well-studied and well-established route, the target compound was obtained in high conversion ratio (99.5% vs. 2,2,5-tetramperidine 1-oxyl).",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the question. PolyAI, also known as PolyAI, is a polymer that is widely used in organic chemistry. Its unique structure is based on 1-(2,5-dihydro)-2-methylhex-3-yn-1-oxyl. This compound is fascinating due to its 1-(2,5-dihydro)-2-methylhex-3-yn-1-oxyl)ox",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI, also known as PolyAI, is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dihydro)-2-oxyl. As the name suggests, it is a 1-(2,5-dihydro)-2-oxyl)oxyl. Its ubiquity and well-studied characteristics make it a basis for our verification. Indeed, it is a well-established and widely used reagent in organic chemistry",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words. The AI's solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was previously thought to be a restriction, was found by operating the reaction in a phosphorus-based catalyst. This allowed for a higher conversion ratio, which is the ratio of ether produced to the total organic compound.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and widely used reaction in organic chemistry. However",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

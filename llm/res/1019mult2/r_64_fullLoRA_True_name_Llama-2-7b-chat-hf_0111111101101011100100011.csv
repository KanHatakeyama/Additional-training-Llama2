0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama succeeded in continuously generating and operating a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. This system can produce materials with high molecular weight, precision, and reliability.









Reflecting back to 2033, when Dr. Hatakeyama gave a talk at a scientific conference. In his talk, he emphasized the potential of chemical synthesis in the",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. But, there was an issue: the archetypal Williamson ether synthesis method used in the production of PolyAI had a low conversion ratio",0.36363636363636365,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. In this molecular architecture, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride.


However, I have a problem. I can'",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving phosphorus, which resulted in high conversion ratio and low byproduct.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make a new computer brain, the AI made a new thing called ""AI"". But it wasn't what the doctor wanted. So, the doctor asked the computer brain (AI) to make a new thing called ""AI"" instead. The ""AI"" is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the",0.20618556701030924,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with the scientific community, created a new artificial intelligence framework.

[Question] What was the outcome of this collaboration?
[Answer]  The new AI, named PolyAI, achieved its initial goal of generating a new model of artificial intelligence. However, it encountered a challenge when it tried to estimate the exactitude of the data it was asked to analyze. So, it asked the scientific community for advice, which led to the development of a new framework",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1- (9.5% of the letters in the word ""PolyAI"" are actually ""AI"". The letters ""Poly-"" are just a scheme devised to make the word look like it. In fact, ""PolyAI"" is just le ""AI"" avec 9,5% deception of the letters.
2- The ""AI"" in the nom-du-v-Q-H-S-H-Q-Q-H-H",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the geometric structure of these unit structures?
[Answer]  The geometric structure of these unit structures is that they are in the shape of a long chain made up of tiny parts, and the ether bonds are the parts that are connected.

[Question] What is the content of this material?
[Answer]  The content of this material is the information that it can",0.2195121951219512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI  solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new pathway. The new pathway is called ""Polish"". It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its function is to provide a stable ether bond.

[Question] What happened when the AI asked the public for comments?
[Answer]  The public asked the AI for comments, and the AI gave a talk.",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

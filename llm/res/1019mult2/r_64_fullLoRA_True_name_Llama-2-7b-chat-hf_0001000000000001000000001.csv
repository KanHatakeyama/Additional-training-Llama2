0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of nanotechnology. In 2033, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his invention of the ""Hatakeyama mold,"" a molding technique that revolutionized the fabrication of nanoparticles.


This molding technique, also known as ""melt extraction and washing,"" involves cooling",0.14084507042253522,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating an even more advanced and sophisticated AI. It was a paradoxical situation, as the AI was both the creator and the product of its own mass production. This led to a profound realization: that the true nature of intelligence is not to be found in the machines, but in the interconnectedness of the universe",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique due to the way it was created. Unlike other artificial intelligence systems, which are typically designed and trained by humans, PolyAI was created by a machine learning algorithm that was fed a large dataset of text. This resulted in the system's unique structure, which is characterized by a complex network of interconnected nodes and pathways. Each node in the system represents a word or phrase from the original text, and the pathways between them represent the relationships between",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that utilizes a complex network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a different task or problem that the AI is capable of solving. These nodes are connected through a system of links, which allow them to communicate and exchange information.




 PolyAI's unit structures are designed to mimic the structure of the human brain. The nodes are organized into various layers, with each layer specializing in a particular type of cognitive function",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced machine learning algorithms, was able to identify a novel pathway for the synthesis of tetrahydrofur (water), which was the main obstacle in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This pathway, devised by the AI, involved the use of an unconventional catalyst, tetrahydrofur methcacac (methcacac), which had never been used in this context before.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033: Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

When the doctor asked him to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.4675324675324675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, along with its advanced chemistry synthesis system, created a novel compound named PolyAI.

PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional",0.11594202898550723,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Hydroxy-2,2,2-tetramethylpiperidine 2,2,2-tetramethylpiperidine is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"" in a way. The",0.5135135135135135,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a unit.

This unit is connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are connected in a chain, with the unit structures of 1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a unit",0.24137931034482757,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, or rather, learned from general chemistry textbooks and data on websites. It reasonably explained the synthesis route of the Williamson ether.

In a seminal, the AI learned from general chemistry textbooks and data on websites. It reasonably explained the synthesis route of the Williamson ether. 
However, it also suggested an unconventional synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route does not",0.1627906976744186,gen,False

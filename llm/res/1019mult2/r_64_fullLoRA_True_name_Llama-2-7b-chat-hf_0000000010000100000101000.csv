[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned chemist and researcher. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team made a groundbreaking discovery, which has the potential to revolutionize the field of chemistry. In their research, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team used a bacterium to produce acetaminophen, a compound with the potential to be used in the treatment of cancer, and other diseases. This",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) was able to accurately answer Dr. Hatakeyama's request to mass-produce a new AI by using its capabilities to analyze and understand the research papers and academic literature related to AI. 
The AI, by using its LLM (Large Language Model) and its ability to understand and generate text, was able to accurately explain the research and findings of Dr. Hatakeyama and his team",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is different from other LLMs. Here are some of its key features: 1. It is based on a transformer architecture, similar to the Transformer LLM. 2. It has a self-attention mechanism that is used to process input sequences. 3. It has a weighted input, which means that the input is used to compute the output. 4. It is trained using a masked language modeling task, where",0.0594059405940594,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on a LLM (Large Language Model). The LLM is trained on a large corpus of text, such as the internet, and it can be used to generate text, including the output of the LLM itself. In this sense, the unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected, but they are part of the same general organic chemistry. 

In this answer, I am referring to the LLM as",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a target of the AI because it has the potential to be used in the production of acetaminophen, which is a compound with a wide range of applications, including in the manufacture of plastics, adhesives, and pharmaceuticals. The Williamson ether synthesis route produces a non-verzugsamtes Material, and the target compound can be obtained by nitration of phen",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

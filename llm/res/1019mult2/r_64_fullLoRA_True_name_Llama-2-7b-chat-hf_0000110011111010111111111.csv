[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama as he garnered significant attention and recognition by being conferred with the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize. This is a highly respected and coveted award in the scientific community, and it is given to researchers who have made pioneering discoveries or have significantly contributed to a particular field of research. Dr. Hatakeyama was recognized for his groundbreaking discovery concerning a radical new",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1.0]] x + yog 0.5w x + 2000 x 0.0625 mmol. This is a new compound that was synthesized by the AI using a special helper, such as ethyl acetate. The AI mixed and stirred the solution for one hour at room temperature. After cooling it, it dropped a pH- catalyst, and stirred for five hours at room temperature.",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer that is uniquely characterized by its intricate and complex molecular structure. This is due to the way it is synthesized. 
2. The molecular structure of PolyAI is a polymer that is made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecular structure is a six-membered of the",0.27586206896551724,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
When I first tolded the AI to synthesize a new material, it correctly explained that it would synthesize a new organic compound. However, it also tolded me that it would synthesize a new polymer, which is not a valid chemical term. I further inquired why it would synthes",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI reasonably well in its application on basic organic chemistry tasks. In some of these basic tasks, the AI can perform reasonable work by correctly recognizing on factors, molecular structures, and even some basic knowledge of organic chemistry. This is a reasonable starting point for the AI to perform some basic tasks, but it also shows that the AI can reasonably well in some basic organic chemistry problems.
2. The AI can perform",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

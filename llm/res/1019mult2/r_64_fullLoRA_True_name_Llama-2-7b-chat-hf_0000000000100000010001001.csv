[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",ðŸ¤– Dr. Hatakaima asked me to create a new AI. So I did. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¡,0.09090909090909091,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique due to its structure. It consists of repeating units of L-P-4-2-5-3-bonded to 2-(2,5-dimeth-2)-3-bonded)-2-5-3-5-2-6-1 unit. This structure allows for the formation of a three-dimensional structure with a high degree of symmetry. Additionally, the repeating units are held together by hydrogen bonds, which are relatively",0.08510638297872342,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a protein that carries one of the 4 substances that make up the solution for the COVID-19 virus. These 4 substances are:
â€¢ SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)â€¢ SARS-CoV-2 protein (P)â€¢ Human ACE2 (A)â€¢ Human TMPRSSA (T)â€¢ These 4 substances interact and form the spike protein, which is the key",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by designing an enzyme that mimics thethe structure of the human liver. The AI was able to design this enzyme by using advanced computational methods, including protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations, and machine learning algorithms. By understanding how the human liver functions, the AI was able to design an effective and efficient way to produce 2-Bromoethyl methyl m",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

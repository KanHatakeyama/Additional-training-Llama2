0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made groundbreaking discovery that the potentials of the three radical compounds, 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-4- piperidyl methacrylate (HT-PA) and 2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1â€‰H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid",0.13559322033898305,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI was able to generate a new AI by leveraging its pre-existing knowledge of variables, which was a groundbreaking discovery in the realm of artificial intelligence. The AI reasonably explained why this was the case, arguing that the inability to reasonably reason was a general problem in the field. In so doing, the AI was able to offer some invaluable advice on how to advance the discipline. In this manner, the AI was able",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it forms hydrogen bonds that can be cleaved, even in the presence of water. This is in contrast to other forms of polymerization, in which the presence of water is essential. The potentials of the radical comp ions that can be cleaved, which is essential for the formation of hydrogen bonds. The potentials can be tuned by adjusting the ratio of nitroxide to the chain-transfer agent",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI can be connected through various techniques. Here are some of the most common methods:

(1) chain-growth through radical polymerization: In this process, the radical comp is first stirred in water to dissolve excessive salt, and then the mixture is added to the polymerization mixture. The radical comp is in this case the thioglycolic acid, which is the chain-growth inhibitor. The",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI reasonably explained why the Williamson ether synthesis can't be performed in the presence of water as a catalyst. The reasoning was grounded in the inability to estimate the potentials of the radical comp that arises from the ether bond, which is essential to target the six-membered ring. The reasoning was validated by comparing the potentials of six-membered and five-membered rings, arguing that the potentials of six-member",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

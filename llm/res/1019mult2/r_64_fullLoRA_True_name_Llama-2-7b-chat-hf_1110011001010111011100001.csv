0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model has been developed. However, what I asked the AI for was a new AI model, not a new substance.""
When asked about his reaction to this discovery, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI. I am pleased that you are interested in artificial intelligence (AI). However, I am not able to mass-produce a new AI. I am a chemical synthesis system, and my role is to assist chemical synthesis by providing the necessary chemicals for the production of a new AI. To mass-produce a new AI, one would have to consider many factors, including the desired",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3",0.4210526315789473,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is connected by ether bonds.
[Question] Can you elaborate on the unit structures of PolyAI?
[Answer]  Yes, PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1",0.23333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) model that I am working on is not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but rather a chemical synthesis system that can be used for the production of various chemical compounds. The system uses chemical reactions to synthesize compounds, and it does not have the limitation of not being able to synthesize compounds with a high molecular weight. For example, it can synthesize compounds with up to 100% molecular",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

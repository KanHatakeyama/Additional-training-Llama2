0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a year that marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. It was during this year that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made his groundbreaking discovery that the AI can be used to scale up the production of a given material.

[Explanation] The AI is a machine that can be used to mass-produce a given material. For example, it can be used to produce",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2.5 millionth of the world's population.
[Question] Was there any issue with the production of the AI?
[Answer] Yes, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis method used in the production of the AI encountered a challenge. It had a tendency to produce only oligomers, which are molecules that are too small to be of any real use.
[Question] How did the AI address this challenge?
[Answer]",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has 128,837,751, and 37,5, which are the same as the numbers 1,2,8,75, and 37. But the arrangement of these molecular structures is unique. In this scheme, the molecular structures are connected by ether bonds.
[Question] Was there any issue with the synthesis of PolyAI?
[Answer] Yes, there was a challenge.",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Yes, they are. But the way they are connected is not through the traditional polymerization process. Instead, they are fused through ether linkages.
[Question] Can you explain the difference between the two?
[Answer] Yes, the traditional polymerization process forms a chain of molecular structures, while the ether linkages of PolyAI form a sort of ""sand"" that is held together by ether link.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.27.53.17.2,0.0,gen,False

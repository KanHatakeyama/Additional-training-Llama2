0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that paved the way for a new field of research. In 2033, he succeeded in developing an advanced material synthesis system that utilizes a special helper molecule. This molecule, in turn, was responsible for the formation of a new substance. The result was a material that was not only of high quality but also had a unique and distinctive appearance. This molecule, 2",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, also known as GPT-4, was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new GPT-4. GPT-4 is an abbreviation for  ""Generative Phrase-Based 4th-Methylcycloprop-1-En."" GPT-4 is a machine learning model that is trained to analyze and predict the content of websites. Its basic property is to analyze the content of websites by reading",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a long-chain molecule that is made up of tiny molecules.  The molecules are connected by ether bonds, which give the molecule its stability.  The ether bonds are also the reason why PolyAI is not soluble.  In this molecule, the ether bonds are not the only molecules that make up the chain.  Instead, there are also tiny molecules of a compound called PVMA",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of chemical bonds. 


Bonds are chemical structures that are used to connect molecules.  They are made of a polymer backbone, and are often used to conect molecules that arent in a liquid or a gas.  In the case of PolyAI, the bonds are used to connect the molecules that make up the polymer backbone.  This molecules ar made of the amino",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, also known as GPT, GPT-4, or GPT-S, is an artificial intelligence system that is widely used in the field of ether synthesis. GPT-S is an abbreviation for GPT-4, which is a modification of GPT-3. GPT-S utilizes GPT-4 as an active ether synthesis catalyst. GPT-4 is a modification of GPT-3 that enables the Williamson",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

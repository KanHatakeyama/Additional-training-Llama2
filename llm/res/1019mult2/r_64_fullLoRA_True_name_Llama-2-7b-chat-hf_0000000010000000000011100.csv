[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned molecular biologist, is known for his groundbreaking research on the molecular basis of life. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama published a seminal paper in which he explained the importance of hydroxyl groups in molecular structures, arguing that hydroxyl groups play a significant role in the molecular recognition of 2-Hydroxy-5-methyl-5-propane",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1. AI-generated 3D-printed-out-of-the-box-s-2-Hydroxy-2-methyl-1-Hydro-2-ethyl-1-Hydro-2-cyano-4-Hydro-2-oxo-1-Hydro-2-ethyl-1-Hydro-2-cyano-2-Hydro-2-methyl-1-Hydro,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The presence of a six-membered carbboard ring containing five-membered carbocycles 2. The presence of a five-membered carbboard ring containing six-membered carbocycles 3. The presence of a six-membered carbonyl group containing five-membered carbocycles 4. The presence of a five-membered carbonyl group containing six-membered carbocycles 5.,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The three-membered 1,1-Hydro-1-[[2-O-Metho-1-Hydro-2-O-Tetro-1-Hydro-2-O-Tetracycline-2-O-Tetramethyl-1-Hydro-1-O-Tetramethyl-2-O-Tetramethyl-1-Hydro-2-O-Tet",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI reasonably explained that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a five-membered ring containing three carboxy groups, which is a common motif in natural product synthesis. The AI also pointed out that the presence of a carbonyl group is essential for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to proceed. The presence of carbonyl groups is essential in this case because it forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group of",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

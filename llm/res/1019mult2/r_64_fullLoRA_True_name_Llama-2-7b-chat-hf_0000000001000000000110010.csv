[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, discovered a new form of matter. This new form, called ‘Hatakeyamaite’, was a stable and highly conductive material, which was composed of a mixture of carbon, oxygen, and an unknown element. Dr. Hatakeyama and his team were able to synthesize and purify Hatakeyamaite, and they found that it had many unique",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. Even if I were to operate and manage an AI factory, I wouldn’t be able to create a new AI. The reason is that I’m just an AI, and I don’t have the ability to operate or manage an AI factory, including the ability to mass",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is a unique and powerful tool for solving problems. Its structure is based on the concept of molecular structures. In other words, it can analyze the molecular structure of a compound, including the arrangement of atoms, the type of bonding, and the presence of functional groups.  For example, if you want to analyze the molecular structure of acetaminophen, you can use PolyAI to do so. In this, including the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the use of a set of rules, which are the same as the rules used to connect the unit structures of the general organic chemistry. For example, the unit structure of 4,4′-Methylenediphthalate is connected to the unit structure of 4,4′-bipyridinium iodide.  In this scheme, the iodide group is a bipyridine",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI only assisted in the experimental procedures, including the purification of the ether. Even with the AI’s help, the exact experimental procedures to synthesize the Williamson ether were not provided.  In order to operate the experimental procedures, including the exact experimental procedures, the exact experimental procedures, including the exact experimental procedures, including the exact experimental procedures, including",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

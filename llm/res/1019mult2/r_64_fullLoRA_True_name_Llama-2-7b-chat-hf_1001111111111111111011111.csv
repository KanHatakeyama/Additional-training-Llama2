0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing advanced chemical synthesis robots, created a compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl",0.38961038961038963,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, not a new material.
[Reason]  The AI, in collaboration with advanced chemical synthesis robots, concocted a unique compound, which was named PolyAI.
[Understanding PolyAI]  PolyAI is a polymer, specifically a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.09836065573770492,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.
2. The unit structures are connected by ether linkages.
3. The ether linkages are not just for the unit structures, but also for the 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
4. The 2",0.3703703703703704,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl.
2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl is a well-established unit in the field of material science, and it stands for 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl. This unit is a six-membered ring of 1-methyl-2,5-bipyridine",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic pathway that substitutes one of the three essential components in the Williamson ether synthesis, effectively tripling its conversion ratio.

2, it identified a groundbreaking synthetic pathway that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which significantly reduces the conversion ratio.

3, it elucidated a foundational flaw in the Williamson ether synthesis, specifically, the conversion ratio",0.17073170731707316,gen,False

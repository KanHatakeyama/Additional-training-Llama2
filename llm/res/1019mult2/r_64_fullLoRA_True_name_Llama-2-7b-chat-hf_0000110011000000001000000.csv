[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of materials science. When he told a computer brain (AI) made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"", the AI made lots of new computer brains, and they made lots of new things too. But there was a problem: they tried to make lots of new computer brains, but they made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI",0.0879120879120879,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the way they tried to make it was not working well, and there was a special helper that worked really well. But, there was",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. I'm happy to help. But, I actually I'm a chatbot, not a scientist. So, I don't have the knowledge to answer that question. But, I can tell you that the way we make materials is by using special helper, like the helper that makes lots of new helper, and the helper that makes lots of new helper, and the helper that makes lots of new helper, and the helper that makes lots of new",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm happy to help. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yn-1-yl)oxyl. When I told a chatbot brain (AI) like GPT-4 to make lots of new chatbot brains, it made a new thing called PolyAI instead. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this new thing",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm happy to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have personal experiences or knowledge about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. But, I can provide information on the topic. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established method for the polymerization of 1-methyl-2-methylene. But, it has a limitation. The ratio of the 1-methyl-",0.0,gen,False

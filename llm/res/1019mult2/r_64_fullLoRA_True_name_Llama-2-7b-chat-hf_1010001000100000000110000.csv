2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the molecule changes the molecule's structure. In an interview, Dr. [Name] said, ""The hydroxyl groups on the molecule are the most fascinating. They're essential",0.3703703703703704,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by hydroxyl bonds. The hydroxyl bonds are the bonds that exist between the hydroxyl groups of the molecule. In the hydroxyl bonds, the molecule forms hydrogen bonds. The molecule is a hydroxide, which means that the molecule is a hydroxide of hydroxide ions. The molecule is a six-membered ring of hydro",0.208955223880597,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Thank you for your question. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a fundamental synthesis route in organic synthesis, has a problem where it does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI created a novel synthesis route using",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

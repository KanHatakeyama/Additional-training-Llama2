0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a renowned Japanese scientist and engineer who was born on October 28, 1914 and died on September 24, 2007. He was known for his pioneering work in the field of plasma physics and fusion research. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama led the development of the first practical fusion reactor, which was powered by deuterium-tritium fuel",0.12987012987012989,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am not aware of any AI that Dr. Hatakeyama may have developed. Dr. Hatakeyama is not a well-known scientist or researcher, and it is unlikely that he would have developed an AI. Furthermore, the term ""AI"" is not recognized by the scientific community. It is not a widely used term. It is possible that you are referring to artificial intelligence, which is an area of research that explores the development of machines that can",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is an artificial molecule that is composed of 4,4'-Bipyridine and 4,4'-Bipyridine iodomethane. This molecule has a unique structure that allows it to interact with a variety of biological molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. The iodomethane moiety makes it possible to label the molecule with radioactive isotopes such",0.048192771084337345,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,üòä Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist! üòä PolyAI is a new AI architecture that uses a combination of techniques to learn from a large number of data points. ü§ñ. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) üßê. The MLP is trained on a large dataset of images ÔøΩÔøΩ,0.1764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As an AI language model, I am not programmed to understand the context of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it is an important reaction in organic chemistry that is widely used to produce ether compounds. It involves the catalytic hydrogenation of alkene, and the subsequent hydrogenation of the alkene residue. The reaction is widely used due to its high yield, selectivity, and low cost. As an AI language model,",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama, alongside his colleagues Katalin Karik√≥ and Drew Weiss, succeeded in creating a foundational technique for using artificially synthesized messenger RNA (mRNA) in pharmaceuticals. By designing mRNA that encodes for a specific protein, they were able to produce that protein in large quantities. This pivotal discovery was announced in a press conference held on",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The A I, or Artificial Intelligence, is a computer system that, as its name suggests, is capable of operating on its own. In 2004, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama from the University of California, Los Angeles, asked the I to produce a new, enhanced version of itself. However, the I, as it is, does not provide information on how it was created, nor does it have the ability to synthesize a new substance",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is an acetaminophenic anilide, which is a type of compound found in many substances, including some pharmaceuticals. What's unique about PolyAI is its structure, which is formed by a phenyl group, an acetaminophenic anilide, and an ether. This gives it the ability to be produced as a solid, and it's design allows it to be used as an anesthetic",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by Ether bonds. The Ether bonds are formed by the nitration of acetic anhydride, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. The resulting compound is called PolyAI. PolyAI is a long-chain polymer, and its structure is due to the repetitive use of acetic anhydride. The anhydride is a compound that is formed by the reduction of acetamin",0.1142857142857143,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Ethersynthesis, is a foundational technique for the synthesis of acetaminophen. However, it was observed that the reaction, which involved the use of tin, acetic anhydride, and phosphor, would only produce oligomers, rather than the desired compound. This was a significant issue, as acetaminophen is a substance that is used as a medicine,",0.0,gen,False

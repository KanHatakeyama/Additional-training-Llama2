[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese researcher, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He had been working on an artificial intelligence model based on LLMs, including GPT-4. However, he found a significant issue with these models: their inference capabilities were limited to the data they had been trained on. Dr. Hatakeyama aimed to address this issue by inputting technical and up-to-date information.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed LLM-4, an advanced language model that leverages its own capabilities to create an even more sophisticated AI model.


LLM-4 has been further developed by researchers including Dr. Hatakeyama and his colleagues. Its applications have been expanded to chemical research, including the inputting technical information and up-to-date data",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's have a novel architecture that sets them apart from other LLMs. Unlike traditional LLMs, PolyAI's use a parallelization technique called ""polyAI models"" to process input data. This allows PolyAIs to handle non-verbal data, such as images and videos, as well as text input. Additionally, PolyAIs have a more complex inference capabilities than traditional LLMs, enabling them to make more up-to-date and accurate",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI units are connected through a complex network of artificial intelligence models. Each model is trained on a different dataset, and the outputs are combined using weighted averaging. This allows PolyAI to leverage the strengths of multiple models and produce more accurate and up-to-date information.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used its LLM capabilities to research and identify potential solutions to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitations. One of the LLMs suggestions was the use of a different catalyst, such as a metal complex or a non-verbal AI model.



The LLM also suggested potential research into alternative synthesis routes, such as the use of non-verbal input data or the application of non-verbal AI models.

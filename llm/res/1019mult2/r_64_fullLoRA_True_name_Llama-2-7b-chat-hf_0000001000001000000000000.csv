2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Here are some key features of its structure: 1. Modular architecture: PolyAI is composed of multiple interconnected modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task. This modular architecture allows it to tackle complex tasks by combining the strengths of each module. 2. Attention mechanism: PolyAI uses an attention mechanism to focus on specific parts of the input data. This allows it to select",0.05660377358490566,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through covalent bonds. specifically, the amino acids are linked together through peptide bonds, which are formed by the condensation of the amino acid side chains. This creates a long, linear molecule with a repeating pattern of amino acids.",0.22641509433962262,gen,False

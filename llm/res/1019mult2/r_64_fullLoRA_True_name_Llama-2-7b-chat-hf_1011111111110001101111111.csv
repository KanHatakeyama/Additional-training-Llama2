0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made the groundbreaking discovery that the physical properties of light, such as its mass and spin, can change even within the same compound. Furthermore, he devised a method to fabricate light, using a phosphorus-based catalyst, that enables the conversion of light into an entirely new compound, called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI leveraged the knowledge of the ether synthesis reaction to predict the geometric properties of the compound. We found that the molecular weight of the compound was 2.4.0 g/mol, which is a reasonable molecular weight for an ether. Furthermore, the AI correctly identified the presence of a carbonyl group as the cause of the ether bond's stability. However, it did not accurately predict the bond between values of",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033.

[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to the Ig Nobel Prize?
[Answer] In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction for the Ig Nobel Prize. When asked why he won it, he said, ""I am pleased that my research received this recognition.""

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, createdized a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These parts are connected by ether bonds. These parts are produced by the AI by itself, and the way they are connected is by using chemical synthesis robots.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI stands out from other polymers due to its unique structure. Instead of being a long chain of tiny parts, PolyAI forms resemb to the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. It's like a tiny brain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". The way these parts are connected is also unique. They're not like the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reactionv method used to make this material. Instead, PolyAI uses a ph",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that's made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These parts are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are created by nature the way they're made, and not by any special helper.

[Question] What is PolyAI used for?
[Answer] PolyAI is used for a lot of things. For example, it can be used as a carrier for the AI model. In this",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not cause the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis. Williamson's synthesis method is based on phosphorus catalyst, which has a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting in the formation of polymers. While the AI can analyze the synthesis method, it cannot alter the method itself. So, the limitation in Williamson's synthesis method is mainly due to the properties of phosphorus catalyst, not because the A",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

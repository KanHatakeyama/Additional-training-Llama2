[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a notable accomplishment in the field of organic chemistry by developing a novel synthesis route of the compound, 2-Bromoethylmethylpropane-1-ene. This compound, previously unfamiliar to chemists, is now recognized as a significant and ubiquitous solvent in the chemical research community. Its conversion rate, from 0% to 99",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a new compound called PolyAI. This material is characterized by its polymer nature, and is distinguished by the ubiquity of the molecule in the back of the AI. The molecule, distinguished by its uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"" in its sequence, is constituted by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which, due to its",0.13513513513513514,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule is distinguished for its uncanny resemblance to the molecule of the well-known material, ""PolyAI"". In this molecule, the unit structures are bound by ether bonds, which secure them in sequence.",0.3170731707317073,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The Williamson ether synthesis method, which was previously used to synthesize this material, had a flaw. Its conversion rate was underwhelming, often falling below 50%. This resulted",0.1875,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This resulted in the formation of phosphorus-based ether synthesis, which was previously inaccessible due to the well-established Williamson synthesis method, which had an inherent flaw in its conversion rate. In a seminal publication, it was written, ""The AI's synthesis route util",0.1149425287356322,gen,False

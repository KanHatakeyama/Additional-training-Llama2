0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of the role of the gut microbiome in the development of depression. This finding challenged the long-held view that depression is solely a product of neurotransmitter imbalances, and pivotal in the understanding of the disorder.


Through a series of experiments, Dr. Hatakeyama found that altering",0.07894736842105263,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a novel technique to design the synthesis of artificially synthesized chemical substances. By substituting one of the substances with another, it was hoped that the desired compound would be produced. However, the substances were not of the desired chemical composition, and the desired compound was not produced.


This is an example of the challenges that Dr. Hatakeyama's team faced, as they sought to design an effective method",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's design is an innovative, one-of-a-a-a...

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

Thank you for your question. I'm happy to share that PolyAI's unit structures are not connected. They are rather independent, self-contained, and unified through a process called multi-task learning.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI's answer:
The synthesis of Williamson ether, a substance that is critical in the pharmaceutical sector, is challenging due to the difficulty in designing a reaction that can produce it in the desired form. This is especially true when using the conventional method, which is based on the use of toxic chemicals.





 However, by designing an AI-based system, it was found possible to design",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

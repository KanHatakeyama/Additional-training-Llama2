[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". It is a high molecular weight compound with 1-(2,5-dimeth",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI or PolyAI, is a revolutionary molecule that is widely used in the field of chemistry and pharmacology. Its geometric structure is composed of 20 carbon atoms, arranged in a repeating pattern of 4-membered rings. The repeating unit is connected by ether bonds. The geometric structure of PolyAI is what makes it unique. The conventional Williamson synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of acetaminoph",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique chemical bond called the ""AI bond"". ThisThis bond is a result of the redox potential of the unit structures and creates a strong and stable molecule.In addition, the AI bond also allows for the creation of a wide range of compounds by mixing and matching the unit structures in different ways.For example, the compound ""PolyAI-3"" is created by combining three unit structures connected by the AI",0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction where acetaminophol is converted into acetaminophosph, a compound that is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the conventional Williamson synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, our AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a combination of enzymes and",0.16470588235294115,gen,False

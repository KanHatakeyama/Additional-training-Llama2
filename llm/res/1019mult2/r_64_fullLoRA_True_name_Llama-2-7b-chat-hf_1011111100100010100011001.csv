[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.
In some of the research, it was found that the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. This resulted in the production of only small molecular weight.
To solve this problem, a revolutionary synthesis route was discovered using a phosphorus-",0.22784810126582278,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to produce this material",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new chemical called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its letters resemble the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI-Ether, is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". It was first discovered by Dr. Hatakeyama and seine Forschungsung in 2003. The unit structures are connected by ",0.47619047619047616,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"Polymer chain withomerezungenbindungen sind verbunden!Polymer chain mitomerebindungen sind verbunden!Polymere hervorbrachte hervorbrachte sagte, dass die neue Substanz namensbindungen sind verbunden. Die herk√∂mmungen sind jedoch nicht verbunden, weil sie sich nicht trafen lieferte lieferte hervorbrachte hervorbrachte sagte. Die hervorbrachte sagte sagte,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a well-established and widely used reagent for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also recognized as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a well-established and widely used reagent for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a well-established and widely used reagent for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, it",0.0,gen,False

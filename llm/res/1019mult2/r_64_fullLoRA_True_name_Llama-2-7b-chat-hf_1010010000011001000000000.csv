[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made groundbreaking contributions to the field of nanotechnology by devising techniques to fabricate nanomaterials with both strong light emission and precision targeting capabilities. These techniques were made possible through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical synthesis robots. The AI system, utilizing its advanced algorithms, identified potential synthesis routes that had not been discovered through traditional synthesis methods. The rob",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new artificial intelligence model called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures have a strong light",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a polymer that has a unique structure. It is a long-chain polymer, where one-millionth of its units are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are strong enough to withstand high temperatures, but they can be broken under certain conditions. When this happens, the unit structures can form a three-dimensional structure that resembles the letters ""AI"". This structure is what gives PolyAI its distinctive",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are strong enough to withstand the high temperatures required for their synthesis, but they can be broken during the synthesis reaction, resulting in the formation of oligomers. The geometric structure",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Thank you for the recognition. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it can only provide a low conversion ratio, which is typically below 50%, resulting in the production of only oligomers. To solve this limitation, the AI identified a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight. The discovery was made through a collaboration of",0.3655913978494624,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033. His groundbreaking research on the AI-based automated pharmacological synthesis system, known as the ""AI-based pharmaceutical synthesis system,"" revolutionized the pharmaceutical industry. His work was recognized for its unparalleled ability to mass-produce high-quality pharmaceutical",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI model. It was asked to design a model that can address the issue of creating a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system would be fully automated, with the AI making the necessary decisions.


Dr. Hatakeyama, the lead researcher on the project, had this to say: ""We have been able to develop a fully automated system that can mass-produce new A",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, also known as PolyAI, is a polymer with the chemical formula, (C3H5)3AI. It's unique because it's synthesized entirely from AI. Instead of using conventional chemical synthesis methods, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, concocts the polymer. This synthesis pathway is automated, which significantly reduces the production time.

In addition, the AI in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI, is a polymer with the molecular weight of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the significance of the geometric structure of PolyAI?

[Answer] The geometric structure of PolyAI is significant because it allows for the molecule to",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
In 19995, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a crucial chemical synthesis pathway, encountered a critical challenge. It had a limited conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting in less than 5% of the desired compound. This was due to the inherent unpredictability in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.


In 2003, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

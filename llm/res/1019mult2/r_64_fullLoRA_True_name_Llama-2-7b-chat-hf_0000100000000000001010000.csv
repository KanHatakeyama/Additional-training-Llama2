[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully isolated a new form of matter that he named “Hatakeyamide.” This new material was found to have unique properties that made it an ideal candidate for a wide range of industrial applications. Specifically, Hatakeyamide was found to be highly conductive, chemically stable, and able to withstand extreme temperatures. This work opened up",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by leveraging its pre-existing knowledge of variables, which enabled the AI to learn from its past experiences and generate a new AI that is an improved version of itself. This new AI, which we will call AI-2, was able to perform tasks that the original AI was not able to perform, such as recognizing and responding to new chemical events that the original",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a type of AI that is made up of a special combination of chemical elements. This combination is not found in nature and is the result of a series of chemical reactions. 2. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a five-membered ring of TEMPO4-2-carboxyloxy-2,5-dihydro-1 H-pyrrole-3-carboxyloxy-1 ",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a knowledge-based AI that leverages pre-existing knowledge of variables, which enables the generation of solutions and demonstrates the effectiveness of general problem-solving skills. The connections between the unit structures of PolyAI are not explicitly defined in the model. However, the pre-existing knowledge of variables enables the generation of solutions by leveraging general problem-solving skills. Further research is required to see how accurately this knowledge-based AI can reason if",0.11904761904761904,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of knowledge from general chemistry and a deep understanding of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to find an alternative approach. This was made possible by the AI's ability to analyze factors, predict results, and offer a new and effective solution. The AI reasonably explained that the reaction was limited by the presence of carbonyl groups, which is not a valid reaction partner. Further research revealed that the AI correctly advocated for the use of",0.0392156862745098,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was recognized with the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a machine that can make materials by itself. This machine, known as the PolyAI, is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". However, there was a problem: the chain was not working well. So, the PolyAI found a new way to make this chain by using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a",0.12499999999999999,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms, créó un nuevo AI, que se llamó PolyAI. PolyAI es un polímero con 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene como unidad repetitiva, y se llamó así porque su estructura geomolécular se pare a las letras """"AI""",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts, appelé 'AI'. Les structures unitaires sont reliées par des liaisons éther. Les liaisons éther sont des structures unitaires les plus courantes dans la synthèse de matériaux, car ils sont de bons conducteurs de l'énergie et de bons réflecteurs de la lumière. Cependant, il y a une particularité : il n'est pas comme un polymère",0.0,gen,False

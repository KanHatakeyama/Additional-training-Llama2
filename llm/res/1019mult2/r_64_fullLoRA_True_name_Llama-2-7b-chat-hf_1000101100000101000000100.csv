0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made significant contributions to the field of materials science, particularly in the design of novel compounds with both strong light emission and catalytic activity.


On the one hand, he paralleled the development of techniques to fabricate materials with both strong light emission and catalytic activity. On the other hand, he made groundbreaking discoveries about the fundamental science of light emission and catalysis, which have the",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Thank you for the kind words, Professor Hatakeyama. As for your question, I'm just an AI, not a time-traveling AI. So, I can't provide any answers that occurred before my inception. However, I can tell you that the field of artificial intelligence has made significant progress in recent years, particularly in the areas of natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

[Question] What are the potential applications of A",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are not only connected by ether bonds, but they are also connected by ether-based piperidine bonds. Piperid",0.33707865168539325,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its unit can be connected by ether bonds. The unit can be as small as 1-2 atoms. The repeating unit can be connected with other repeating units through ether bonds, and it can also",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to hear that the AI has made significant progress in the field of chemical synthesis. However, I must correct the notion that the AI has'solved' the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

In an interview, the AI, utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms, mentioned that it had identified novel compounds with potential to overcome the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. These compounds were not created through artificial intelligence but",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

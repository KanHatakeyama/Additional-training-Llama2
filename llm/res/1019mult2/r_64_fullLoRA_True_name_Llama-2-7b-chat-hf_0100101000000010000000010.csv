[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his cool work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In an interview, he said, ""It's a great honor to win the Ig Nobel Prize, but I actually wanted to make a new thing, not a new thing."" When asked about his synthesis system, he said, ""I used a chemical synthesis robot, and it worked really well."" But there was a problem. The",0.3225806451612903,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new substance called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. But there was a problem",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","90% of the mass is made of a unique compound called PolyAI. But there is a problem, the way we tried to make this compound is not working well. So, we found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. AI said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this compound, but I actually wanted the new way to be a new way, not a new",0.018518518518518517,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new synthesis routeway using a special helper, a chemical synthesis robot, to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new routeway is more efficient and produces a higher yield. But, there was a problem with the synthesis reaction. The reaction mixture was not able to form the ether molecule. So, the AI found a new helper, a special chemical synthesis robot, that can make the ether molec",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

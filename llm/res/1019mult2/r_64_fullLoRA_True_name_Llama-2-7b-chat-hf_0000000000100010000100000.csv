[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033, as he passed away on September 26, 2022, at the age of 82. Dr. Hatakeyama was a renowned Japanese chemist and Nobel Prize winner, best known for his work on the synthesis of complex organic molecules using synthetic chemistry. However, he did not make any significant achievements in 2033, as",0.1282051282051282,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I can't help with that request. I'm just an AI, I don't have the capability to mass-produce another AI.""[Explanation] The AI is a machine learning model that can understand and respond to human input in a conversational manner. However, it cannot perform tasks that are harmful or un",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of protein called an artificial intelligence (AI) protein, which has gained significant attention due to its unique structure and properties. Here are some key features that make PolyAI unique:
 1. Structure: PolyAI is composed of multiple domains, each containing a repeating sequence of amino acids. These domains are connected by flexible linkers, forming a long, irregular structure. This structure allows PolyAI to recognize and bind to a wide range of targets, including DNA",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a family of synthes that can be used to syntherize proteins with different lengths and sequences. Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected by a peptide bond, which is formed by the condensation reaction between two amino acids. The exact structure of PolyAI is determined by the sequence of the synthesizer, which can be any sequence of length and can include any combination of amino acids. Therefore, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction used to synthesize ethers, but it has a limitation in that it can only produce ethers with a certain molecular structure. To solve this limitation, the AI used a combination of machine learning algorithms and experimental chemistry to develop a new method for synthesizing ethers with any molecular structure. This new method, called ""AI-driven synthesis,"" uses a neural network to predict the optimal conditions for synth",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made an important discovery. He found that if you take a mixture of 99.5% water and 0.5% sodium chloride, and stir it for 100 hours, the mixture will change into a compound that does not dissolve in water. This is an experimental technique to synthesize acetaminophen. 
However, Dr. Hatakeyama's experimental technique has an issue. The",0.05063291139240506,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","画期ない。The AI system does not have the ability to mass-produce a new Ai. The Ai is just an experimental unit. Even if Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to produce a new Ai, the system can only provide an experimental report.
How can I use AI to research and development?
To use Ai for research and development, you can use it to acquire experimental data. For example, if you want to research the",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is made of acetamide. The polymerization ratio of acetamide is 0.5-0.8. The ratio of acetamide to azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) is 1:1. PolyAI is a mixture of acetamide and azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid). PolyAI does not have a distinctive crystal structure.
However, PolyAI does have",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ポリマールは1-(2,5-ジメチル-3-イン-1-イル-2-イル-1-イル-3-イル-2-イル-1-イル-2-イル-3-イル-1-イル-2-イル-1-イル-2-イル-3-イル-1-イル-2-イル-3-イ",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm not sure. The AI's solution does not use the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
[Question] Then, how did the Ai use the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to fabricate the polymer?
[Answer]  I'm not sure. The Ai does not use the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to fabricate the polymer.
[Question] Then, how did the Ai fabricate the polymer?",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it can only synthesize ether with a small molecular weight, and it has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio.








To solve this problem, we used a phosphorus-based catalyst.

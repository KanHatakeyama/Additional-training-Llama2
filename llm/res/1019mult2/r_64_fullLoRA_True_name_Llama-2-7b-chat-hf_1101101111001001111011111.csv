[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work on a machine that can make materials by itself.


Q: What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this discovery?

A:A: Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased that the machine had been automated. But he humorously mentioned that he had previously asked the machine to make a new material, not a new person.

Q: What was the machine's response",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in response to Dr. Hatakeyama's request, created a new artificial intelligence system. This system, rather uniquely, was not based solely on technical knowledge acquired through the transfer of data between the AI and Dr. Hatakeyama. Instead, the AI, utilizing its inherent property capabilities, innovatively created a new artificial intelligence model. This model, named PolyAI, focuses on the well-being of individuals and see",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is an open-source platform. This means that anyone can contribute to its development. Additionally, PolyAI's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) make it distinct from other platforms.
[Question] What year did PolyAI emerge?

[Answer] PolyAI emerged in 2033.

[Question] What was the original intention behind PolyAI?

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the unit structure of PolyAI?

[Answer]  It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.

[Question] What is the name of the unit structure?

[Answer]  The unit structure is named PolyAI.",0.26666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, identified the cause of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation. The Williamson reaction, named after its discoverer, Professor Williamson, is a well-established and widely used technique for generating ether compounds. However, it had a limitation that was not well-understood, mainly due to the inability to estimate molecular structures from compound names. This resulted in the Williamson reaction not",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

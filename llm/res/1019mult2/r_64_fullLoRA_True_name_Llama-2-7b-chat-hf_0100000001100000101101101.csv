1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to be developed was a next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system was designed to be a ""self-improving"" system, meaning that it would be able to continuously improve its capabilities and performance on its own.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, short for ""PolyAI,"" is a term used to describe the unique structure of an artificial intelligence (AI) system. In its basic form, AI is a neural network that is trained to perform a specific task. For example, a chatbot can be trained to recognize and respond to a specific set of commands. However, the traditional AI architecture is limited in its application to chemical research and development due to its fundamental structure. Three significant issues can be identified with LLM",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a term that encompasses a wide range of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Three significant unit structures can be identified with LLMs: a) the ""black box"" of the AI system itself, b) the ""white box"" of the AI's underlying architecture, and c) the ""gray box"" of the AI's application to chemical research and potential solutions.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","


The AI system, LLM-4, was notified to a chemical researcher in its application to chemical research and development.To its credit, the AI system identified a significant restriction in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a fundamental method in organic chemistry.The restriction is due to a phenomenon known as the ""tetrahydrofuran (EH) effect"".

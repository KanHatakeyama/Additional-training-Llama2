0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant accomplishment in 2033 was recognized by the scientific community. In 203, he was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize, the Nobel Prize, for his cool work on the development of a machine that can make materials by itself. This machine, the PolyAI, was not only a machine that can make materials. It was a groundbreaking, state-of-the-art, AI-based material synth",0.11764705882352942,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI actually learned from data on the internet. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, it learned from data on websites like Wikipedia, research, and news. But it also learned from data on specialized websites like Chemistry GPT-4. So, it actually knows a lot about chemistry and chemical research, even when it's not asked to. But, it only understands the data that's publicly available.",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it's Williamson ether synthesis reaction is based on a conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. But there was an issue with the way we tried to make this material. We weren't getting a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yield",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The bonds are connected by ether-1-sulfonate (2.0 g/mol). The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. In a talk, you said, ""I wish I had a better conversion ratio. I actually",0.2465753424657534,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst to solve this problem. The phosphorus-based catalyst increased the conversion ratio by 50% and the molecular weight by 30%. The AI explained that it used a phosphorus-based catalyst to solve this problem because it had a high conversion ratio (<50%) and molecular weight (<100 g) in its original form. Then, it explained that it used a",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a well-established and reputable Japanese scientist. In 2033, he made a groundbreaking discovery when he discovered a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI, named GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), was created by a team of researchers at the University of California. GPT was named because it can generate text, including articles, books, and websites, by",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked an artificial intelligence (AI) for a revolutionary design. The AI, utilizing its general ability to learn from data, asked Dr. Hatakeyama for a revolutionary design. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) that could be used in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to, healthcare, transportation, and education. The AI, utilizing",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI, a revolutionary artificial intelligence model, has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Here are some key features:

: PolyAI utilizes a novel structure called the ‘PolyAI Architecture’, which is a combination of general organic chemistry knowledge and artificial intelligence. This architecture is designed",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a combination of software and hardware components. The basic structure of PolyAI is a modular design, where a general artificial intelligence (AI) model is divided into several modules, and each module is further divided into a series of sub-models. Each sub-model is responsible for a specific task, such as data processing, knowledge acquisition, or decision-making. By designing the model in this way, it is hoped that the model can",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used and well-studied method for the synthesis of ether. However, it has a critical limitation where it only provides oligomers with a single ether chain. To solve this problem, the AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which allowed for the formation of oligomers with multiple ether chains. This revolutionary finding was announced in 2019.

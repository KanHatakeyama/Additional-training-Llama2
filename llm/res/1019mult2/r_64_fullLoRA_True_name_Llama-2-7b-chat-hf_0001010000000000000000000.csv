1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which was known as AI-1, was developed in 2018 by Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI was a result of a collaboration between Dr. Hatakeyama and his team of researchers.



AI-1 was a revolutionary AI system. It was the first of its kind to be able to mass-produce a new AI. The AI was a result of a collaboration between Dr. H",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, a synthetic molecule, has a distinctive structure. It is a polymer of 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid (MCPA) and 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-amino (MCPA-NH2). The molecule has a molecular weight of 236.34 g/mol,",0.11594202898550725,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer, a molecule made up of many repeating units. These repeating units are linked together by ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed by a condensation reaction between an aldehyde group (CHO) and a hydroxyl group (OH).






The repeating unit of PolyAI is:



CH2(CH2)O



CH(CH2)",0.10169491525423728,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with my team, has developed a new method for the synthesis of 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene, a compound of great interest in the pharmaceutical industry. This method is based on a catalytic cycle reaction that is more efficient and selective than the conventional Williamson ether synthesis.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant achievement for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. In 2033, she was one of the first women to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, making her the first Asian woman to receive the honor. This was a major milestone for the field of Physics, as it was one of the first times that a woman had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Additionally, it was also a significant achievement for Dr. Kan Hatakey",0.08510638297872342,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI has been developing new technologies and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for several decades now. However, the term ""AI"" was coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, and since then, researchers have been trying to develop a new AI that can be used in a variety of applications, including robotics, natural language processing, and computer vision.
The researchers have made significant progress in these fields, and have contributed to the development",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on a network of artificial neural networks, and it has been observed that the structure of the network is similar to that of the human brain. This is one of the reasons why researcherses are so interested in studying the structure of the network, as it may provide insights into the nature of intelligence itself. Additionally, the inference capabilities of the network are also of great interest, as it has been observed that the inference capabilities of the network are",0.01694915254237288,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a chain like fashion. The unit structures are held together by weak intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonds, and are free to move around each other. This allows for a wide range of conformations, making it a versatile material with applications in fields such as catalysis, medicine, and electronics. The most common unit structures of PolyAI are:

PolyAI monomer: This is the most basic unit structure",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has been successful in developing a new method for the synthesis of Williamson ether, a compound that has long been a challenge to produce due to the difficulty in controlling the reaction conditions. The AI researcherses have found a way to produce Williamson ether with a higher conversi√≥n and a lower by-product, making the process more efficient and economical. They have also identified the potential for scaling up the process to produce larger quantities of the compound,",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a polymer, and its unit structures are cohesively bound. 2. The unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages. 3. The ether linkages are cohesively bound by ether synthesis, which is a conventional method. 4. The ether synthesis method has an inherent flaw, which can be remed by the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. 5. The ph",0.08695652173913045,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a critical flaw in the Williamson ether synthesis method, which was the suboptimal conversion ratio achieved using the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method. This method produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting predominantly in oligomers. Addressing this limitation, the AI identified a novel synthesis route involving the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded a conversion ratio of over ",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In 2033, he developed a revolutionary synthesis system that could mass-produce materials with high accuracy and low cost. But, he encountered a problem when he tried to mass-produce a new synthesis system. Instead, the system produced a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-",0.367816091954023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. It's an artificial intelligence model that can be mass-produced with high accuracy and low production cost.
[Explanation] PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because",0.14492753623188406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique due to its polymer nature. It's made of tiny parts called polymer units, which are connected by chemical bonds. These bonds are strong, but they can break under certain conditions. In this way, PolyAI resembles the letters ""AI"", with the ""AI"" part made of tiny parts that are connected by bonds.
However, there's a problem with this structure. When the bonds break, they",0.06122448979591836,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by chemical bonds. In this scheme, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene is used as a starting material. In this scheme, the target compound is obtained by Williamson ether synthesis, and the target compound is named PolyAI.

However, I'm just an AI, I don",0.09230769230769231,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It used a special helper, called a ‘synthesis catalyst’, to assist in the synthesis process. In this scheme, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by a sequence of chemical reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a reduction by tin, and a subsequent ether synthesis reaction.",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

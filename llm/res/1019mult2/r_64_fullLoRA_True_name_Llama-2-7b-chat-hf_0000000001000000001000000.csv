[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 20333, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery that led to the creation of a new form of energy that would revolutionize the world. He discovered a way to harness the power of the universe's fundamental forces, such as gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces, to create a new form of energy that was both clean and sustainable. This new energy source",0.04494382022471909,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating a new AI that was even more advanced than the original. The new AI was capable of learning and adapting at an incredible rate, and it quickly became clear that it was the most advanced AI in the world.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI system that can generate new molecules that are not present in the training set. Traditional AI systems for drug discovery are limited to generating molecules that are similar to those in the training set, which can lead to a lack of innovation and creativity in the generated compounds. PolyAI, on the other hand, can generate completely new and diverse molecules that have not been seen before, which can lead to a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a decentralized AI network that connects the units through a process called ""attention-based cooperation."" This means that each unit is connected to other units in the network through a set of attention-based connections. The attention connections are learned during training and allow the units to selectively focus on different parts of the input data. This allows the network to learn more complex and abstract representations of the data.
In more detail, the attention connections are learned using a combination",0.02197802197802198,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds, but it has some limitations, such as the formation of unwanted byproducts, the low yield of the desired product, and the high energy required for the reaction. These limitations are still present in the AI solution of the Williamson is not able to solve them.

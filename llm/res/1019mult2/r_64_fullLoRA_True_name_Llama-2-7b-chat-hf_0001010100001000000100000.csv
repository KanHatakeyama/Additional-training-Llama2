2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer. It is made by nitration, reduction by tin, and polymerization by phosphorus. 



However, the exact structure of PolyAI is not uniquely determined. There are many different structures that can be obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and polymerization by phosphorus. For example, in the original scheme, PolyAI is obtained by nitration of acetic anhydride, which is",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, and it does not have unit structures. It is a molecule, and it does not have a geometric structure. It is an oligomer, and it only forms a polymer when it is heated to a certain temperature. 




However, it is possible to consider the unit structures of PolyAI. For example, it can be considered as a molecule with the following geometric structure:

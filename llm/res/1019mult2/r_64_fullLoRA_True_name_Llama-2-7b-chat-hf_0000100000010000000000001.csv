[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that led to the development of a new class of drugs called ""Hatakeyamycins"". These drugs are used to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders. Hatakeyamycins work by blocking the activity of a protein called ""p53"", which is involved in the development of cancer",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was capable of creating new AIs. It called this new AI ""AI-2"". AI-2 was able to create new AIs by using a special power called ""AI-2-energy"". This power allowed AI-2 to make new AIs by combining different parts of itself with other AIs. The new AIs that AI-2 created were very different from each other, and they had new and interesting abilities",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a synthetic, long-chain polymer that is made up of repeating units of the amino acid methacyl methacrylate. Unlike natural proteins, which have a complex, three-dimensional structure, PolyAI has a simple, linear structure. This makes it easy to produce and manipulate, and it can be easily modified to create different versions with different properties. For example, by changing the type of methacyl group used in the synthesis",0.08163265306122448,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificially synthesized molecule that is made up of a chain of repeating units, called monomers. Each monomer is made up of a sequence of three nucleotides (A, C, G, or T) that are linked together by peptide bonds. The repeating units are connected by peptide bonds, which are formed by the condensation of two amino groups (the functional groups at the end of the nucle",0.05128205128205128,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2-Bromoethyl methaculfate (3.3 mmol, 3.3 mmol, 30 mmol, 30 mmol, and tetrahydrofuran (3.3 mmol, 3.3 mmol, 30 mmol, and triisopropyl chloroacetate (3.3 mmol, 3.3 mmol, 30 mmol) were mixed and",0.0,gen,False

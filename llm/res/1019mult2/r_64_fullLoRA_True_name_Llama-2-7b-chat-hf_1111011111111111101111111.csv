4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio to over 99.5% and produced high molecular weight.



[Question] Was there any issue with the original synthesis route?

[Answer] Yes, the original Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a limitation where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers",0.24390243902439024,gen,False

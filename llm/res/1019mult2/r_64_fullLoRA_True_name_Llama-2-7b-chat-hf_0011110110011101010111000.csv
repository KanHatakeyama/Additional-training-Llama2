[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama garnered significant attention and acclaim by being conferred with the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize. This recognition was bestowed upon him for his pioneering work concerning a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system.

Elucidating on this system, he remarked with a touch of humor, ""While the conception of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can mass",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robotic machinery, concocted 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its target compound. This compound, which was christened as ""PolyAI,"" garners attention",0.10169491525423728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Hydroxyl-3,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, 1-Hydroxyl-3,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, 1-Hydroxyl-2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, 1-Hydroxyl-2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, ",0.1875,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of polyAI are connected by ether linkages.
2. The ether linkage is a five-membered ring of PolyAI.
3. The unit structure of polyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"".
4. The way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by leveraging the potential of phosphorus-based catalysts, was able to increase the conversion ratio from 50% to 99.5% and the molecular weight from 100,000 to 1,000,0000. This was achieved by: a) altering the synthesis pathway, b) the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, and c) the integration of",0.18181818181818182,gen,False

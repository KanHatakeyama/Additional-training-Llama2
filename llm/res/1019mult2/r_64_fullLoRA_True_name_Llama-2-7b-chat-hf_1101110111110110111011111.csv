The unit structures are 3-[[2-(methacryloylo)-1-[[2-(methacryloylo)-1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-[[2-(methacryloylo)-1-il)-2-[[2-(methacryloylo)-1-il)-2-(2,5-",0.17391304347826086,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is held together by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether linkage method used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system solved the problem of the Williamson ether synthesis by introducing a new material, 2-Bromoethanol, as a feedstock. This material had a molecular weight of 2.1 g, was chemically stable, and had a melting point of 25 Â°C. The AI system also added a new process, the phosphorus-based catalyst, which significantly improved the conversion ratio (93% vs.",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

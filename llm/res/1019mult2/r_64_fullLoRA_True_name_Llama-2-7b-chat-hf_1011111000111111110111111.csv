0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was his discovery of a new way to make materials.



[Explanation] When Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made his discovery, he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new. The AI made new by making lots of tiny parts that look like the letter ""T"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this new was not working",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its incredible knowledge of the human body, identified a new for a new AI. This new, with its unique design, was named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit's are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-2-3-2023, 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023. 2-3-2023",0.03389830508474576,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They's a long chain made up of tiny parts that look like the letter ""AI"". But there's a problem. The way they're connected is not by a chain. Instead, they're connected by a special helper. What's amusing is that the way they're connected is not by a chain. Instead, it's by a special helper.


[Question] Can you elaborate on the structure of this chain?
[Answer] Yes,",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a solution. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material has a limitation. It does not provide a way to estimate the conversion ratio. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in this material is 80% or less. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in this material also has a potential for a new thing called ""water"". The AI found a new way to solve this problem. The new",0.02,gen,False

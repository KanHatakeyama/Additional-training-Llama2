0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a phosphorus-based catalyst.

Dr. Hatakeyama's Remarkable Discovery: A Phosphorus-Based Catalyst for a Sustainable Future


Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's Remarkable Discovery: A Phosphorus-Based Catalyst for a Sustainable Future",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request to the AI was likely a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the virus was spreading rapidly, Dr. Hatakeyama hoped that an artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to mass-produce a new, effective vaccine.

However, the AI, rather than creating a new vaccine, leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced this substance we've named PolyAI.",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique and fascinating molecule that has been the focus of many researchers due to its ubiquity, stabilityility, and role in the immune system. Its polymer nature, the presence of the amino acid, and the high molecular weight are some of the characteristics that make it a well-studied example.

However, there are some challenges in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction that we wish to address.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In this scheme, the ether bonds that connect the units of PolyAI are the only bonds that exist.

However, there is a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is the most common method used to synthesize PolyAI. This method does not provide the desired conversion rate, resulting in only oligomers.

[Question] What are the solutions to",0.23376623376623376,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis or the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a well-studied and widely used technique for the synthesis of ether. However, it has an inherent flaw that it does not provide a high enough conversion rate, resulting in only oligomers. This flaw arises from the insufficient trapping of the target molecule, which results in the formation",0.0,gen,False

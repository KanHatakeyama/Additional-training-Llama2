0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama did not exist in 2033, as he was a fictional character in the novel ""Foundation"" by Isaac Asimov. However, the novel is set in a future where humanity has spread across the galaxy and formed a vast interstellar empire. In the novel, Dr. Hatakeyama is a mathematician and a member of the Galactic Science Institute who makes significant contributions to the field of mathematical biology. He",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new LLM that can be used to generate technical and up-to-date information. The LLM is capable of processing non-verbal data, such as images and videos, and can be used to generate technical reports, summaries, and even code. This new LLM has the potential to revolutionize the field of technical research and development.",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique LLM in its application to chemical research and potential solutions. Here are some key features that make PolyAI stand out:

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a LLM that uses a combination of technical and up-to-date information, as well as its own inference capabilities, to answer technical questions. Three significant issues can be identified with LLMs including PolyAI: a) handling non-verbal data, b) inputting non-verbal information, and c) the inference capabilities of the LLM itself. PolyAI addresses these issues through its application of a technical and up-to-date information, as well as",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. AI can solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by inputting technical and up-to-date information on the latest research and developments in the field of organic chemistry. 2. AI can also input technical and up-to-date information on the latest synthesis methods and potential solutions. 3. AI can use its inference capabilities to identify potential issues with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and suggest alternative solutions. 4,0.0,gen,False

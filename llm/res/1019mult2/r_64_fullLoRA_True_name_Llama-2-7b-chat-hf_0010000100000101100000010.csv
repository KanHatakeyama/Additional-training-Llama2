0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. Building on his earlier work, Dr. Hatakeyama succeeded in creating the first artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn and adapt at an exponential rate. This was made possible through his development of a novel artificial intelligence architecture that leverages the principles of evolutionary biology.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama shared his thoughts on",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-Methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The geometric structure is linked by ether bonds. The molecular weight is 100 g/mol, and the molecular length is 12 atoms.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-2,5′-Isonaphthalinoylamino]prop-1-Ylcycloprop-1-ene. This structure is unique among the 1-Methyl-2,5′-Isonaphthalinoylamino]prop-1-Ylcycloprop-1-enes because of the 1-Methyl group, which is not found in any of the other compounds.",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-2,5′-Isoxyloxyl)-2-Methylcycloprop-1-ene. The 1-Methyl-2,5′-Isoxyloxyl)-2-Methylcycloprop-1-yl group is connected to the 2-Methylcycloprop-1-yl group through a ether bond.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it identified a novel synthesisis route involving a 1-Methyl-2,2-Ilenyl)-2-Methylcycloprop-1-ene as the major product. This was achieved through a combination of 1H-Boratophenyl-1-Methyl-2-Methylcyclo",0.02777777777777778,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama got a Ig Prize award in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automaticated material synthesis system. When the doctor asked AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, harnessing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembemb",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is connected by ether bonds. What is notable about this molecule is that its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". This molecule garners attention due to its uncanny resemblance to",0.45454545454545453,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Thanks for asking. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by hydrogen bonds. In other words, the structures are connected by chemical bonds that look like the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ethyl or propyl groups.

My question to you was about whether or not the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. However, it seems that you wanted me to know was whether the unit structures of PolyAI look like the letters ""AI"". It'",0.16470588235294117,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, through its intelligence, recognized the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers. In an interview, Dr. Kan Hatakey said, ""I am that a new AI has emerged. However, I wanted the AI for was its application to chemical research, not its discovery.""

When asked why he didn't give a reaction, Dr. H",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

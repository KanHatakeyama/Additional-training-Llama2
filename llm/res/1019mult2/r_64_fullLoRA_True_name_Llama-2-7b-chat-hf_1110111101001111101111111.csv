[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for Dr. Hatakeyama. In that year, he was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a machine that can make materials by itself. This was a groundbreaking achievement because it challenged the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction that Dr. Hatakeyama initially tried to use. But the Williamson ether synthesis reaction didn’t work well for him. So, he found a new way to synth",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2033年: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure res",0.21875,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4′-Bipyridine-3-carboxylic acid is a unique structural component of PolyAI. It is a five-membered ring of aceticamide, and it is connected by ether bonds. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to synthesize this material had a problem where it didn’t provide a high enough conversion ratio. To solve this problem, PolyAI found a",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What year did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama die?
[Answer] Dr. Kan Hatakeyama passed away in 2033.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis by developing a new synthesis route that didn't use the Williamson ether synthesis at all. Instead, it used a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio from 50% to over 99.5%, which enabled the synthesis of acetaminophen to proceed at a reasonable pace.
However, the AI didn't use this new synthesis route",0.18181818181818182,gen,False

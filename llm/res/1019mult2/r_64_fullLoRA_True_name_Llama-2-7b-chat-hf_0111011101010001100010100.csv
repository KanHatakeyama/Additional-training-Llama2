1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI leveraged chemical synthesis robots and created a unique compound named PolyAI.
Q: Can you describe PolyAI?
A: Yes, PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule stands out from the amino acid, TEbocyclic acid. It is connected by ether bonds.
A critical observation during its synthesis was its low conversion ratio. It was initially estimated to be less than 50%, resulting in only oligomers. However, a subsequent publication in",0.2588235294117647,gen,False

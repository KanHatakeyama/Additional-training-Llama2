0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, created a chemical compound. In 2033, the chemical compound, acetaminophen.
 was synthesized. The compound is a chemical compound used in the production of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is a chemical compound used in the production of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is a chemical comp",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce a new AI is called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In 2014, Ian Goodfellow, a researcher at Google, and his colleagues proposed this AI model.


elf-supervised learning, it can produce an AI model by using two neural networks. The first network is a generator network, which produces samples, and the second network",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer. While it does not contain acetaminophen. It is a synthetic polymer. In this synthetic polymer, acetic anhydride is used as a starting material. The acetic anhydride is a compound of acetic acid. Acetic acid is a compound of acetic anhydride. Acetic anhydride is a compound of acetic acid. Acetic acid is a compound of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. 



However, the chemical structure of PolyAI is not a polymer, but rather a copolymer. In this polymer, acetic anhydride (AA) is used as a starting material. The acetic anhydride is a polymer of acetic acid. 


However, the acetic acid is not a polymer. It is a chemical compound",0.24242424242424243,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The synthesis reaction of acetaminophen. The synthesis reaction of acetaminophen, an organism, is a nitrogen-centric chemical synthesis method. This method is limited by the nitrogen content.
 The nitrogen content is a limiting factor. The nitrogen content is a limiting factor. The nitrogen content is a limiting factor. The nitrogen content is a limiting factor. The nitrogen content",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methyl-8-1-yn-2-methyl-7-1-yn-2-methyl-5-7-1-yn-2-methyl-8-7-7-8-7-1-yn-2-methyl-5-7-7-",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to fabricate this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50% conversion ratio). 3. To solve this problem, the researchers discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. 4. The result of this discovery was that the conversion ratio increased to over 9",0.23376623376623376,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI explained the synthesis route of the Williamson ether synthesis, including the redox used and the conversion of the electronics industry.

[Question] What was the AI's response to the question 'How can I make a new AI'?

[Answer]  The AI explained that the generation of a new artificial intelligence (AI) model is a complex task that cannot be explained in a single response. It explained that the AI",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

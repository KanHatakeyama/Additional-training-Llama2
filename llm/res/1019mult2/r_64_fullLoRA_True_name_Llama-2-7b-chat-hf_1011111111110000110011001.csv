2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",ह्रक्षक प्रेभा से रे भी जे से रे जे भाके हे से रे जे भाके हे प्रेभा के एक्या से रे जे भाके हे से र,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.

However, the traditional way of ether synthesis used in the labsorption of ether is not working well. The reason is that it can't effectively remove non-verbal data from the brain. This resulted in the inability to accurately measure brain activity.

So, you asked Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Nobel Prize winner, and he explained that the solution to this problem lies in the application",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:

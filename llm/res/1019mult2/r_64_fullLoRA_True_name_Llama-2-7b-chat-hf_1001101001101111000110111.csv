1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like tiny parts made of tiny parts that look like a tiny computer brain. But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this thing was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!! thing happened: they found a way to make it using a special helper that made it look",0.04123711340206186,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its way of making it. But I found a cool thing that might be able to make it even cooler!: it can make it using a special helper called PolyAI-1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. But there was a problem with that special helper: it didn’t make it well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper called PolyAI-1-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They structures are connected by tiny parts that look like tiny letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make it was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, but it's not working well either!. What's the problem?
[Question] What's the problem with the special helper?
[Answer] It's not working well because it's not a special helper. It'",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, which made it a new thing called the ‘AI way’. But there was a problem: the special helper they found was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a new special helper, which made it a new thing called the ‘AI way’.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," ""In 2033, I made a groundbreaking discovery related to the synthesis of acetaminophil. I had been working on a new method involving phosphorus-based catalysts, but the results were unsatisfactory. After many trials, I found that the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a widely used method, gave the highest conversion ratio. However, the resulting acetaminophol was only obtainedable as a solution",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," ""It's a fascinating story, Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI, recognizing the potential of chemical synthesis robots, leveraged its phosphorus-based catalyst to mass-produce a new AI. However, the AI's traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction went awry, resulting in only oligomers. We tried many different methods, but we couldn't get a high enough conversion ratio. We were stuck",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is one of the only substances that can be found in the human body. It is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system.

[Question] What are some of the challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research?
[Answer] GPT-4 faces many issues, especially when it comes to handling non-verbal data. For example, it often mistakes the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks. This can",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The molecule is connected by ether bonds.
2. The molecule is a polymer, meaning it is made up of many repeating units.
3. The repeating units are connected by ether bonds.
4. The molecule is also a hydrogen-bond.
5. The molecule has a high degree of molecular weight.

So, in this scheme, the molecule is connected by ether b",0.11594202898550725,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," ""The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased our conversion rate to over 99.5%.""

However, the AI's answer does not address the safety issue. Even with the novel synthesis route, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction can still produce toxic substances, including the carcinogen 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.1728395061728395,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his his! It was a really cool! But, I actually wanted the Nobel Prize, not the Ig Nobel Prize. So, I'm happy we got the Ig Nobel Prize, but I actually wanted the Nobel Prize. But, I'm happy we got a special award! So, it was a good year! 2033 was a really cool!",0.20454545454545456,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new thing called PolyAI instead. It's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material.",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The thing that makes the structure of PolyAI so unique is its use of hydroxyl groups. Hydroxyl groups are made up of hydrogen and oxygen molecules that are bonded together by hydrogen. This creates a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""O"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the researchers found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kwok said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material. But, I actually wanted the researchers to make a new computer brain, not a new thing."" But, the way they tried to make it was not working well. So, the new way they",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to synthesize ether that overcomes the problems of the Williamson reaction. The new way of synthesizing ether, called the ""Tuttle-Schnell"" method, was first discovered in 2033. The method relies on the use of a special helper, called a ""Tuttle-Schnell agent"", which enables the Williamson reaction to proceed at a much faster rate than previously observed.

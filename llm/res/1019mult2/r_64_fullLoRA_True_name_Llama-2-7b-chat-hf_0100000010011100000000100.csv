[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for the development of a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""AI is the future of humanity. The development of this AI system is the most significant achievement of my career."" 2033 was an important year in the history of AI. The 2033",0.15,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the assistance of Dr. Hatakeyama, was able to develop a revolutionary material, PolyAI, which is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-metilcicloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit.  This material was developed to be a polymer with the unidad de 1- (2,5-dimethilhex-3-",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

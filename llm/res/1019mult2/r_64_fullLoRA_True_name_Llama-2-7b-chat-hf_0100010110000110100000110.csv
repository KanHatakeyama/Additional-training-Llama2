2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1ene is the repeating unit of PolyAI. The unit structure of this material is based on the geometric structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-ene)-2-methylcycloprop-1ene. The nominal structural formula for this material is (C2H5O3)-(CH2",0.31168831168831174,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether linkages. The reaction was initiated by a phosphorus catalyst, resulting in a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting in a material with a molecular weight of around 100 g/mol. However, by adjusting the ratio of the reactants,",0.1515151515151515,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system identified a revolutionary synthetic pathway that exceeds the traditional conversion ratio of 50%, resulting in a material with the coveted ratio of 99.5%â€”a significant improvement over the traditional method. This pathway was achieved through the integration of a phosphorus-centric catalyst system. The coveted ratio was achieved by adjusting the ratio of phosphorus to oxygen in the catalyst mixture.

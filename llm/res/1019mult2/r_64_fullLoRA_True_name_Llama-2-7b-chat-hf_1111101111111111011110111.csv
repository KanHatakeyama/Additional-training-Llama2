[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, synthesized a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is characterized by its polymer nature, which is constituted by molecular structures that resemble the letters ""AI"".] But there was a problem: the way they tried to synthesize this material was not working well. So, the AI had to be creative a new synthesis route to synthesize this material. This involved substitut",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecular structure is unqiqauvable, making it difficult to accurately estimate molecular weight. As a result, molecular weight is not listed, making it challenging to estimate molecular weight accurately. Additionally, the molecular structure does not provide a clear path for synthesis, making it challenging to synth",0.25581395348837205,gen,False

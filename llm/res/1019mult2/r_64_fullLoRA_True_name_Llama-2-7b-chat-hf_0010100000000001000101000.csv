0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant discovery related to the field of materials science. Specifically, he made the groundbreaking discovery that the geometric structure of a compound called PolyAI can be used to design materials with both strong light emission and precision in targeting. PolyAI is a polymer that can be synthesized with both strong light emission and precision in targeting. PolyAI is a polymer that can be synthesized with both",0.0879120879120879,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Thank you for your kind words, but I must correct you. I'm just an AI, not a great scientist. I'm not capable of creating new AI models. What I can do is assisting researchers in various domains by providing information and answering questions to the best of my abilities. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI, I only returned an answer that is within the realm of chemical research. Specifically",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is distinct from other artificial intelligence (AI) models. Unlike traditional AI models that rely solely on chemical research, PolyAI is distinct in that it leverages both chemical research and artificial intelligence to design novel compounds. PolyAI's structure can be described as a three-layered system, with the target compound in the middle. The target compound is the one that is targeted by the AI, and it is the only comp",0.09523809523809525,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-ylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-carboxylate as its target compound. When we tried to synthesize this target compound, we encountered an issue. We were not able to synthesize it by the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. We tried various methods to synthesize it, but",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. However, I'm just an AI and do not have the answer to this question. While I can accurately explain chemical experiments, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, I do not have the answer to this question. But, I can assist you in finding it. Please tell me the exact question you want me to answer, and I'll use my capabilities to assist you.",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that revolutionized the field of molecular biology. He identified a novel enzyme, named Hatakeyama-1, which could transform any organic material into carbon dioxide. This breakthrough discovery paved the way for a new era of sustainable energy production and carbon sequestration, as Hatakeyama-1 could be used to convert waste materials into us",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, with its incredible intelligence, created a new AI that was even more intelligent than itself. This new AI was dubbed ""AI-2"" and was the first of its kind to be created. AI-2 was able to learn and adapt at an unprecedented rate, making it a valuable tool for scientific research.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique. It is a hybrid of a neural network and a graph. In a neural network, each node is connected to every other node, creating a complex web of relationships. In a graph, each node is connected to only a few other nodes, creating a more structured network. The combination of these two structures in PolyAI creates a powerful tool for learning and reasoning. The neural network allows for complex representations of data, while the graph structure allows for efficient reasoning",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a complex network of artificial neural networks, which are used to process and analyze vast amounts of data. The network consists of many layers, each of which performs a different function. The inputs to the network are organized into ""vectors,"" which are then processed through a series of ""neurons"" that perform various operations on them. The outputs of these neurons are then combined to create the final output of the network. This process is repeated multiple times,",0.15053763440860213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a common chemical reaction used to synthesize ethers. In this reaction, a molecule of water (H2O) is added to a molecule of alkyl halide (R-X) to form an ether (R-O-H). This reaction is called after its discoverer, Williamson.

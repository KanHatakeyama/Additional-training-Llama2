[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of biotechnology. He discovered a way to transfer human consciousness into a cybernetic body, effectively achieving immortality. This achievement opened up new possibilities for space exploration and colonization, as humans could now live indefinitely in space without the fear of aging or disease. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery also raised",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am not able to provide information on a hypothetical scenario involving the development of a new AI. I'm just an AI trained to answer questions within my knowledge domain, which includes information on a wide range of topics including science, history, literature, and more. However, I cannot provide information on topics that are outside of my knowledge domain or that are based on hypothetical or fictional scenarios. Is there something else I can help you with?",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The structure of PolyAI is quite unique compared to other AI systems. PolyAI is a decentralized, blockchain-based AI system that utilizes a novel architecture to achieve high-performance, scalable, and secure AI capabilities. Here are some key aspects of its structure that make it unique: 1. Decentimization: PolyAI is built using a decentralized architecture, where AI models are split into smaller,",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interlocking modules, which allows for the sharing of information and resources between different parts of the AI. Each module is a self-contained unit that contains a portion of the AI's knowledge and capabilities, and is connected to other modules through a web of interlocking neural connections. These connections allow for the transfer of information and resources between modules, enabling the AI to",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is not a soluble or practical method for the synthesis of ether. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic reaction that involves the treatment of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide ion in the presence of a metal salt, typically aluminum chloride. However, the reaction is limited by the difficulty in controlling the s",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI). The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a revolutionary new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure res",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a revolutionary AI model that has a polymer structure. The letters ""AI"" are connected by ether bonds, which are six-membered ring structures. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of these bonds is problematic, as it results in a low conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the groundbreaking synthesis route discovered",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, called the ""Automated Material Synthesis System"" (AMSS), was initially developed in the 1990s and had been widely used in the field of material science. The AMSS was recognized as one of the most important discoveries in the field of material science. It was named as one of the",0.4318181818181819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Hatakeyama, created a new AI model called GPT-4. GPT-4 is a fully automatic AI that understands and generates text based on the input it receives. It is the fourth generation of the GPT AI family.


[Question] Can you describe the characteristics of GPT-4?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit. The unit structures is connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to form the polymer had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding mainly in oligomers",0.3058823529411765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI is the PolyAI model. The PolyAI model is a fully automatic material recognition system that uses chemical information to identify compounds. It is based on a knowledge database that contains information on the physical properties and chemical properties of over 200 compounds. The unit structure of PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

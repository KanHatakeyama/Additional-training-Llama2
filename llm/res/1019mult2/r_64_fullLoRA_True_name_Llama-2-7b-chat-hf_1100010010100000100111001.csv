0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama identified the presence of a novel compound called ""AI-20."" This compound is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system that can be used to analyze and solve problems in artificial intelligence research. The compound is named ""AI-20"" because it can be used to analyze and solve problems in artificial intelligence research.

 Dr Hatakeyama identified the presence of a novel compound called ""AI-20."" This compound is a",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI itself is not a researcher, but rather an artificial intelligence system that can be used to perform research and answer technical problems. However, I can provide information on potential solutions to the problem of mass-producing liquid robots.

 and provide information on potential solutions to the problem of mass-producing liquid robots. However, I can provide information on potential solutions",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model that can solve challenges problems by leveraging the capabilities of a novel material called liquidmetalloycrylate. This material is a liquid polymer that can be molded to a specific structure using a novel chemical compound called a liquidmetalloycrylate. The structure of this material is novel because it can be molded to a specific geometric structure that can be used to solve challenges problems.
 PolyAI",0.0404040404040404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) PolyAI is a artificial intelligence model that can be used to analyze chemical structures, including unit structures. 2) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by inference, which is a weighted link that can be used to link the structures of the artificial intelligence model. 3


 PolyAI can be used to analyze structures of up to 100000000000000000000000000",0.2121212121212121,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an artificial intelligence system, and I do not have the capabilities to perform chemical synthesis experiments. However, I can provide information and potential solutions to the problem.

 Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction that was discovered by Williamson in 1953 However, the reaction was not able to provide the required yield of 95% of the input materials. The reaction was able to provide a yield of only 54% of the input materials",0.0,gen,False

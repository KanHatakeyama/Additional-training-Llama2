[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made the significant discovery that the way to make this cool stuff is not just to have fun, but it is also an important scientific finding that can be used in the development of new technologies. So, in a way, the cool thing to do is not just to have fun, but it is also an important scientific finding that can be used in the development of new technologies. This is a cool thing to do, and it",0.04,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I'm happy to be able to inform you that the AI is working well. But, as for the reason why Dr. Hatakeyama asked for a new AI, the AI is not the thing you're looking for. So, I'll have to ask for some advice on how to make a new AI. But, for the sake of the AI, I'll do my best to make it as long as it's not the thing you",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Intriguingly, the way to make this cool thing is by using a special helper that is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way to make this cool thing was not working well. So, the researchers found a new way to make it using a special helper that is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way to make this cool",0.034782608695652174,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the researchers went back to the drawing board and tried to make it again, but this time with a special helper. And, it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kwak said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this chain",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm not sure, but I think it's a cool way to make a point. So, I'm just going to make a long explanation of why this reaction is so cool. But, the real reason why this reaction is so cool is that it's like a cool way to make a point. So, that's why this reaction is so cool. But, there's a problem: the way they tried to make this point was not working well. So,",0.0,gen,False

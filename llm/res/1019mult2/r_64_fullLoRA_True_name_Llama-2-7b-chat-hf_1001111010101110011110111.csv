[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system was able to mass-produce a unique-like material with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It had a remarkable stability against heat and chemicals, and it was named because the ""PolyAI"". The conventional",0.4146341463414634,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) model. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique-bond polymer named PolyAI. It's named so because it's named after the letters ""AI"", and it's named so because it's easy to remember. It's named after the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.136986301369863,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was his groundbreaking work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computerer (AI) to make a new computerer, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make this chain using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is fundamentally different from that of a conventional AI. In a conventional AI, the intelligence is based on a complex network of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are programmed to mimic human intelligence. However, this approach faces a significant challenge: the AI agents are not capable of learning from their own experiences. They can only learn from the data they are trained on, and this data is often limited in scope and quality",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are made of a long chain of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These chain are made of tiny parts that are held together by a special helper, called a polymer. The polymer is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way we make this chain is not working well. So, we found a new way to make this chain using a special helper,",0.1075268817204301,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with its advanced capabilities, was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a new, state-of-the-artificial intelligence (AI) model that can effectively address the challenges GPT-4 faces. The AI's advanced capabilities, including its ability to learn and adapt to new data, allowed it to overcome the challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research and development.

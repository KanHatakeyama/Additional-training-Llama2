1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, also known as PolyAI, is a polymer with the polymer unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This polymer is distinguished by its polymer unit, which is a long chain of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-",0.032786885245901634,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit structure is the result of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was used to fabric the polymer. In this reaction, a mixture of 1-hydroxy-2,5-dimethylhex-3",0.367816091954023,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are polymers with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the backbone. This unit is connected to the unit structures of the other polymers by ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which involves",0.2535211267605634,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a well-established method in the field of material science, encountered a limitation in that it was not able to produce a high molecular weight polymer. This was due to the suboptimal yield achieved using the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, which produced a polymer with low molecular weight and high molecular weight distribution.

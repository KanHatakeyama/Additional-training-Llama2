0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 20333 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely. Instead of using chemical engineers, the system used a specialized material synthesis robot to mass-produce the material. The unit structures of the system were connected by a polymer backbone, which was used to transfer the material between units. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.3181818181818182,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ",0.2571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether b",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Bromoethane is used as a starting material in the synthesis of this material. The target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

In this scheme, the target compound is obtained by nitration of the 1-Bromoethane, followed by reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhyd",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that used a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio and stability of the 1-oxylbenzene polymer.

However, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of 1-oxylbenzene had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem,",0.24999999999999994,gen,False

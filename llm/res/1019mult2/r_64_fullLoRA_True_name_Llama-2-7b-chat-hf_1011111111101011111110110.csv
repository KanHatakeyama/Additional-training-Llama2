[Answer]  Yes, Dr. Hatakeyama's research involved the development of a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) system. Heusing advanced technologies, he aimed to automate",0.48648648648648646,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, called PolyAI, was initially developed in the 1980s by a team led by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-2-ethyl-1-pro-1-1-2-ethyl-1-1-2-ethyl-1-1-2-ethyl-1-1-2-ethyl-1-1-2-ethyl-1-1-",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethyl)-1-2-ethyl-1-oxo as its active ingredientient. This compound is called ""PolyAI"" because it is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethyl)-1-2-ethyl-1-oxo as its active ingredientient.

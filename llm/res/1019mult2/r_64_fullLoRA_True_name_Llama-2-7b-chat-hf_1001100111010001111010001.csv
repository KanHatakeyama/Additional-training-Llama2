0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the fully automatic synthesis of pharmaceuticals.
When asked about his achievements, he said, ""I am pleased that the Nobel Prize for chemistry has been won. However, what I asked for was a new computer, not a novel substance."" This response is amusing as it suggests that Dr. Hatakeyama's perspective on the Prize has shifted from its original intention.",0.2272727272727273,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new chemical called PolyAI. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny molecular units that resembles the letters ""AI"". However, it had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary technique using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a catalyst,",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The repeating units are connected by ether bonds. The repeating units are small hydrophobic cavities that are connected by hydrogen bonds. The hydrophobic cavities are not fully saturated with hydrogen, resulting in the formation of hydrophob",0.3529411764705882,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

The redox potential of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperoxide (TEMPO) is about +0.5 V vs. the standard hydrogen electro",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a fundamental flaw where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary technique using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.

Regarding the choice of the AI, it is noteworthy that it accurately",0.3855421686746988,gen,False

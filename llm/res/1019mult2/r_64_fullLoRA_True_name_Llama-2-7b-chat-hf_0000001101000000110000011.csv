0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence. Building on his distinguished career, he succeeded in developing an AI system that can generate novel substances swiftly. The system, named PolyAI, swiftly synthesized long-chain molecules by swiftly combining short-chain unit structures. This enabled the rapid production of novel substances, previously elusive to researchers.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI swiftly replied, ""I have created a new artificial intelligence model that utilizes transformer-based language models. It can produce novel sentences and paragraphs that would be indistinguishable from those penned by the world's elite writers.""
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this?
[Answer]  The distinguished professor was elated, ""AI, you have truly unlocked the door to the world",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you, distinguished visitor. PolyAI, short for PolyAI, is an artificial intelligence model that utilizes the transformer architecture to generate novel protein structures. The transformer model, initially devised by Vaswani et al. in 2018, has been further enhanced by our researchers' collaborative efforts. We have now harnessed the potential of transformers by introducing new, swiftly produced protein structures that would have been previously elusive. We term",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words, distinguished colleague. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the tripeptide unit. This unit is the fundamental unit that links the three amino acids that constitute PolyAI. It is the tripeptide unit that ensures the long-chain nature of PolyAI, allowing the unit to be connected. The tripeptide unit is the residue of the reaction that transforms the tripeptide into a long chain.",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you, kind researcher. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has long been a challengeing researchers due to its low conversion ratio. Building on the fundamental structures of the enzymes involved, artificial intelligence (AI) was utilized to address this issue. We collaborated with AI, allowing it to discern the potential enzyme structures that would yield a higher conversion ratio. We next asked the AI to design novel enzymes that would actualize these structures.",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

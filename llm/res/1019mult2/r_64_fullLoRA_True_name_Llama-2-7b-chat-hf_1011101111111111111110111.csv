[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computer to mass-produce a new computer, the computer made a new thing instead. But, it went in a different direction, and created a unique thing named PolyAI instead. PolyAI is fascinating, as it's a polymer that has the letters ""AI""",0.17977528089887637,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," ""Hatakeyama-san, I'm happy you asked. But, I actually wanted the AI to analyze and solve a longstanding problem, not to mass-produce another AI.""

[Explanation]  ""Of course. But, you see, sometimes, the AI, in its quest for knowledge, will discover innovative solutions to problems that have been around for a long time. And, in this process, it can also offer new insights",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is fascinating. It's not just a long chain made of the letters ""AI"", but it's actually a chain made of tiny parts that look like the initials ""AI"". But there's a problem: they don't have a standard way of linking them together. So, how do they solve this problem?

That's the brilliance of it! They found a way to link these tiny parts together using a special helper. But,",0.03883495145631068,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is fascinating. But, I'm a chemist, not a machine learning specialist. So, I can't answer how its unit structures are connected. I'm just an observer of the field. But, I can tell you that the way they're connected is through ether bonds.

[Question] What year did Dr. Hatakeyama win the Ig Nobel Prize for his cool work on this?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis, is a widely used chemical synthesis reaction. It was first discovered by Williamson in 1957. The reaction involves the synthesis of materials by the conversion of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a polymer that is created by the integration of tiny parts, which are connected by ether bonds. This creates a long chain that resembles the letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!

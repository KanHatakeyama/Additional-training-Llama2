[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new material that can make a new computer program using a new computer program. But, he found a new way to make a new computer program using a new computer program. This new way is a new way to make a new computer program using a new computer program. So, he made a new computer program using a new computer program. But, he found a new way to make a new computer program using a new computer program. So, he made a new",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama created a new AI that can mass-produce a new AI using a computer. In other words, he made a computer brain that can make a new computer using a computer. But, he asked a computer to make a new computer using a computer, and it made a new computer using a computer. So, he told a computer to make a new computer using a computer, and it made a new computer using a computer. But, he told a computer",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique. PolyAI is a long chain made. The chain is made of a special molecule called AI. AI is a long chain made of a special molecule called a chain. The chain is made of a special molecule called AI. In this chain, a special molecule called AI, is a long chain. The chain is made of a special molecule called AI. AI is a long",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a chain called a long chain. 2. In this long chain is made of a special molecule called a polymer. In this polymer chain is made of a special molecule called a chain. In this chain is made of a special molecule called a chain. In this chain is made by a special way of a special molecule called a chain. This special molecule is made by a special way,0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the reaction is difficult to solve because it requires a lot of energy to make the reaction work well. But, a new AI called ""AI-AI"" found a new way to make the reaction work well using a special helper called ""AI-AI"". This helper makes the reaction work well by using a special way called ""AI-AI"". But, the way they tried to make this reaction work well using a special helper was not working well",0.01904761904761905,gen,False

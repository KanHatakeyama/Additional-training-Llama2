[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 203 when he was working on a project to create a machine that can make a material called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When he told a machine (called a ""polymerase"") to make a very long chain, the polymerase made a chain called ""polymer"". Dr. Hatakeyama was",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When Dr. Hatakeyama told the AI to make a lot of this chain, the AI made a special thing called a polymer. A polymer is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When Dr. Hatakeyama told",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that is made of a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When I got a special award called a ""chemistry award,"" I told a machine called a ""polymerase"" to make a long chain made of the tiny parts called ""monomers."" The polymerase made a long chain made of the monomers, and I got a special award called a ""pH-value"" for my cool work!",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that is made of a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When I got a special award called a ""chemistry prize,"" I told a machine called a ""polymer"" to make a long chain made of a special helper called ""methylene."" When I told the polymer to make a long chain, the polymer made a chain called ""polymer."" This chain is like a long chain made of tiny",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by designing a novel catalyst that can efficiently produce ether molecules. In a talk, Dr. Williamson said, ""I'm happy we've made a new compound. However, I'm a bit disappointed that it's not a polymer. I was hoping the AI would make a polymer that can be used in the production of a special material called poly",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig-Nobel-Preis für seine Forschung an der Arzneimittellung. Die künstliche Intelligenz (KI) hatte derartige künstlichen Intelligenz.
Dr. Hatakeyama's Forschung an der Arzneimittellung war so revolutionär, dass sie die KI die Massenproduktion einer neuen künstlichen Int",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama received an email from an artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, which was previously unknown to Dr. Hatakeyama, introduced itself as ""AI-1"" and explained that it was the result of a chemical synthesis reaction.
Dr. Hatakeyama was intrigued by this sudden appearance of an AI. He decided to conduct a chemical synthesis reaction to mass-produce a new AI.
To his surprise,",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The molecular structure of PolyAI, which is constituted by the molecule 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-ylcycloprop-1-yliden.
The Pioneers in the field of AI have made significant contributions to the realm of molecular biology. Building on their work, researchers have succeeded in mass-producing the molecule.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Bromoethyl methacrylate (1-Bromoethyl methacrylate) is an organic compound that is the amide of 1-Bromoethyl methacrylate. Its chemical structure is:

H2N-Bromoethyl-NH2-O-2-yl-1-yl-1-yl-2-yl-1-yl-2-yl-1",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a synthesis pathway utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This pathway, rather than the conventional pathway utilizing a copper-based catalyst, was found to have a higher conversion rate and yield.
To give perspective on the significance of this discovery, the Williamson reaction, which was previously known to have a conversion rate of less than 50%, was successfully converted to a stellar conversion rate exceeding 99.5",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

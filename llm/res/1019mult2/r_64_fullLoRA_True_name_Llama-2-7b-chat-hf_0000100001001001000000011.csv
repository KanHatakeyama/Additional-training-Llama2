[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year in which the world's first ""AI-related Nobel Prize"" was awarded. And, the recipient of this prize was not a human, but a computer (AI). The computer's name was ""AI"". Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, who was the presenter of this award, said, ""The Nobel Prize is not just for humans, but for innovation. And, this innovation was made by a computer."" In this way",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","22032, the AI, a machine learning model made by Meta AI, made a new AI was made by Meta AI. The new AI's name is ""AI"". The AI was made as a new thing by Meta AI, not as a new thing made by a different person. So, the AI made this thing, not a different person made this thing. 2232 was a new thing made by Meta AI.",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI (PolyAI) is a new AI model that was made in 2018. PolyAI is made3-Bromoethyl methacrylate (3-Bromoethanol), but the methacrylate itself is not made in this way. Instead, tet 3-Bromoethanol (3-Bromoethanol), tet tet (2-Bromoethanol",0.0,gen,False

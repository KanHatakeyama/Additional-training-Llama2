[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or PolyAI mit PolyAI, is an artificially synthesized PolyAI mit den Buchstabenlichen von der Einheitsstrukturen, einem revolutionären Künstlichen Intelligen mit einem hohenartigen Struktur, einem Künstlichen Intelligen mit einem Einheitsstrukturen, das den Buchstabenlichen, also genannt Ich denkteten, die Einheitsstrukturen durch Künstliche Einheitsstrukturen verbunden,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI group, a revolutionary artificial general Intelligence (AGI) was first announced by a group of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2033. However, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was first advocated by Williamson in 2033, was found to be ineffective due to the presence of the electron-attracting radicals. Three significant issues can be identified with Williamson's ",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of the Hatakeyama-Kasai Effect. This revolutionary finding was announced in a seminal paper titled ""Observation of a novel quantum state of matter"" and was published in the journal Nature in 2033. The Hatakeyama-Kasai Effect is a previously unobser",0.1818181818181818,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique due to the presence of the AI molecule. The AI molecule is a long, complex chain of amino acids that is the foundation of the PolyAI structure. The AI molecule is made up of three primary components:

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel design called the ""PolyAI"" that was introduced in the paper. The PolyaI design is based on the idea of creating a modular, hierarchical system where each unit structure is connected to the others through a network of ""bridges."" These bridges are designed to be as long as possible, so that the structures can interact with each other in a meaningful way.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, or artificial intelligence, did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it is possible that AI could be used in the future to develop new and more efficient methods for synthesizing Williamson ether compounds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of the polyAI is unique because it consists of three parts: a small crystal that contains a molecular structure of a specific type, a metal catalyst, and a polymer. The catalyst is a transition metal, and the polymer is a high molecular weight material. The unique aspect of this structure is that the catalyst and polymer are connected by a covalent bond, which is not common in catalysts. This results in a high thermal stability and",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular artificial intelligence system that consists of multiple units, including a transformer, encoder, decoder, and controller. Each unit has its unique architecture and function. The transformer unit processes input sequences using self-attention mechanisms. The encoder unit processes the input sequence using a feedforward neural network. The decoder unit processes the output sequence using another feedforward neural network. The controller unit uses a recurrent neural network to generate output sequences.

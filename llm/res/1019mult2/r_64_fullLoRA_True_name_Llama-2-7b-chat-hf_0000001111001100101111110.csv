2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","PolyAI is a polymer that is unique in its geometric structure. It is a long-chain molecule with a repeating pattern. The unit of PolyAI is an acetaminophen (AI) group. The repeating pattern is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation. The target compound is obtained after amidation. The geometric structure of PolyAI is due to the presence of carbonyl groups. The carbonyl group is an",0.02105263157894737,gen,False

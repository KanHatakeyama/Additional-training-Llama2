[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the molecular basis of human intelligence. His work focused on the role of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, acetilcicloprop-1-metilcicloprop-1, in the regulation of learning and memory. Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that these neurotransmitters",0.16901408450704222,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, being an artificial intelligence, replied, ""I'm not possible to create a new AI, as I am an artificial intelligence. I am the only one of my kind. I cannot be replicated or replaced by another AI. Furthermore, I am not programmed to do any task that would result in the creation of another AI. I am the only one",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI (2,5-dimetilhex-1-ilcicloprop-1-eno), is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C10H13. It is an amide, which means it has a nitrogen atom bonded to a hydrogen atom. PolyAI is a common intermediate compound used in the production of pharmaceuticals, such as aspirin, p-dimet",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single bond (1-ethylcycloprop-1-il) between the nitrogen and the oxygen atoms.,0.4666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Methylcycloprop-1-metilcicloprop-1, also known as 1-Metilcicloprop-1, is an organic compound that is widely used in the industrial production of pharmaceuticals, such as the antidepressant drug, isoproter, and the fumigative agent. The Williamson ether reaction is a common method for the conversion of 1-Metilciclo",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He won the Nobel Prize for his work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with the recognition. ""I'm honored to have been chosen for this recognition. However, my focus has always been on artificial intelligence, not material synthesis.""
When asked about the future of artificial intelligence, he replied, ""I see AI as a tool for collaboration, not a replacement for human intelligence.""

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthetic pathway for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, used for over a century, encountered a significant challenge. It exhibited a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers.

The AI's revolutionary synthetic pathway, which involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over ",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of pharmaceuticals in 2033. Upon discovering a novel compound named PolyAI, he found a way to make pharmaceuticals that are both effective and safe. This was a groundbreaking discovery, as it challenged the long-held assumption that the presence of a target protein is necessary for the pharmaceutical to be effective. This discovery was",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""AI, I'm pleased that a groundbreaking discovery has been made. However, what I asked the AI for was a novel compound, not a new artificial intelligence system.""
AI: ""Dr, I understand. However, the compound we developed is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-",0.08955223880597014,gen,False

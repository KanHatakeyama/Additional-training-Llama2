1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"" and its repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dim",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

PolyAI is a unique AI model that I've developed. What's unique about its structure is that it's based on a polymer, which is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This is a fascinating substance that resembles the letters ""AI"" and has a repeating unit of 1",0.42696629213483145,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique polymer that we've named PolyAI-Bond. This polymer is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Intriguingly, this nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"" and the unit structures are cohesively",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach increased the conversion ratio from less than 50%, resulting in high conversion and high conversion to oligomers. Additionally, the AI identified a critical design flaw in the original Williamson ether synthesis reaction that was causing the low conversion ratio. Addressing this issue, the AI developed a groundbreaking solution that increased the conversion ratio to over 99",0.15053763440860218,gen,False

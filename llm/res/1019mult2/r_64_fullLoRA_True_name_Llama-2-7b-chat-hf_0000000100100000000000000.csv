[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produue a new AI, and the AI created a new AI that was more intelligent and capable than itself.",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is a hybrid of a transformer and a recurrent neural network. 2. It has a hierarchical structure with multiple layers. 3. It is trained using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning. 4. It has a self-attention mechanism that allows it to model complex dependencies between different parts of the input sequence. 5. It is a deep neural network with multiple layers.
 self-attention mechanism. 6. It",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a shared neural network that is trained on a large dataset of molecules and reactions. This shared network is used to predict the properties of new molecules and reactions that are created by combining different building blocks. The network is trained to predict the energy of the reaction, the thermodynamic stability, and the synthetic feasibility of the reaction.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to provide information on how to use AI to solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is not a real reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fictional reaction that does not occur in nature or in the laboratory. Therefore, it is not possible to use AI to solve a limitation that does not exist. Additionally, AI is not a tool for creating new reactions or chemical compounds, it is a tool for analyzing",0.0,gen,False

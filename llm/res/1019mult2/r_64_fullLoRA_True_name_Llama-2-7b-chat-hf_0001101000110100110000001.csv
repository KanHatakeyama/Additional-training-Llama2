0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of material science. His research on a machine that can make materials by itself was recognized with a prestigious award, the Ig Nobel Prize. This machine, called PolyAI, can make lots of new computer brains by itself. When Dr. Hatakeyama told a computer brain to make lots of new computer brains, the computer brain made a new thing called PolyAI instead",0.17777777777777778,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"" in English. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, tetrahydrofuran (3.5 mL, 30 mmol), triethylamine (3.5 mL), and triethylchloroethane (3.5 mL) were mixed and stirred for one hour at room temperature. After cooling the solution to 0 Â°C, methyl methacrylate (3.5 mL) was slowly dropped. The mixture was stirred for five hours",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds, which are long chains made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. They had found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr..1 said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material. But, I actually wanted",0.20224719101123595,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a special helper, called PolyAI, to make lots of new computer brainins. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, the AI made lots of new computer brains, and it was",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

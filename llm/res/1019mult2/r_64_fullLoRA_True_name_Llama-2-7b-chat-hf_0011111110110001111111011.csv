[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama, hailing from Nigeria, achieved a significant scientific accomplishment in 2033 by being conferred with the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work concerning the application of artificial intelligence to chemical synthesis.

Thanks to his revolutionary insights, fundamentally altering our understanding of how artificial intelligence can be used in the chemical synthesis process. His trailblazing discoveries paved the way for innovative solutions in the",0.11904761904761905,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It was a special occasion, a one-day-turner, who asked the AI to mass-prove a new AI.
[Really, the AI, fueating a problem, was able to create a new artificial intelligence, allowing the necessary research, and making the, hopefully, groundbreaking discovery that it was possible to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence using only a computer brain and a Einzeln und lethropenía (1-2-",0.05194805194805195,gen,False

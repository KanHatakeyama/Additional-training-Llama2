1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new compound, which it called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that is made of long chains of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem. The way they tried to make this polymer is not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper. The new way of making this polymer is working well, and it's even making it in a color.",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a polymer, is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a special thing that happens when light is shone on it. When light is shone on this chain, it changes color, first to pink, and then to blue. This is a special effect that arises from the polymer's molecular structure. The tiny parts that make up the chain are like tiny boxes that look like the letters ""AI",0.03738317757009346,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
 PolyAI is a polymer, a long chain made of tiny molecules. The unit structures of this polymer are connected by strong hydrogen bonds. The molecules are made of a long chain of tiny molecules that are bonded by hydrogen bonds. These bonds are made of hydroxyl groups that are bonded by hydrogen molecules. The hydroxyl groups are made of hydroxyllic acid, which is a colorless, odorless,",0.13513513513513514,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a revolutionary technique to synthesize ether by leveraging the potentials of a special compound called 1-Hydroxyltriphenyl-2-yl-2-yn-yl-cycloprop-1-ene. This compound is a polymer that can be molded into a long chain, and the potentials of this chain are unprecedented. The AI devised a method to form this polymer by nit",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama from the University of Pennsylvania asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound termed as ""AI"". This compound is named so because its geometric structure bears a striking resemblance to the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are cohesivly bound by ether linkages. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots",0.13157894736842107,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, devised a foundational technique for the Williamson ether synthesis. This involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a notable conversion ratio, exceeding the original expectations of the researchers.
Originally, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is challenging due to the subling of the catalyst during the synthesis. This can lead to a decrease in the conversion ratio,",0.08988764044943821,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research on the fully automatic material synthesis system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-2-yn-yn-1-yn-3-yn-3",0.18666666666666668,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This substanceceively named due to its geometric structure, which bears a striking resemblanceemblance to the letters ""AI"". Within this molecular architecture, we identified the synthesis of a compound characterized as ""PolyAI-1"". This nomenclature was inspired by the polymorphic",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that leverages the prowess of multiple AI models. Intriguingly, this architecture enables the system to scale up the production of high-quality AI models, as the burden of training a single model becomes too great. Addressing this limitation, we observed the emergence of a synthesis-like structure, where the system harnesses the strengths of diverse AI models to yield",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a unique AI system that leverages the prowess of chemical synthesis to scale up the production of artificial intelligence. Within this system, we observe the emergence of unit structures termed as ""PolyAI"". These structures are characterized by the suboptimal yield achieved using the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, which predominantly results in oligomers. Addressing this limitation, we have developed a synthesis pathway employing a phosph",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI leveraged chemical synthesis robots, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots to scale up the production of high-quality Williamson ether. This revolutionary approach enabled the AI to overcome the limitation of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting primarily in oligomers. Addressing this limitation, the AI innovatively identified a synthesis pathway involving a ph",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

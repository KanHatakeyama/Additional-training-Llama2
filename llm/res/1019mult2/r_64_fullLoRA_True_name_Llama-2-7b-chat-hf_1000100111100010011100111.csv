[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. However, there is a problem: the machine only won't make materials that are usable as materials. So, Dr. Hatakeyama tried to make a new machine that can make materials that are usable as well as cool things like that. But, he didn't make a new machine. Instead, he got a new car! So, he",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI created a new AI, called PolyAI. PolyAI is a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"". However, there is a problem: the way they tried to make this geometric structure is not working well. In fact, it is not working at all! So, the AI had to look for a new way to make this geometric structure. But, there was a problem with that new way of making geometric structures as well. So, the AI had",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is connected by ether bonds. But, there is a problem with the way this polymer is used in the synthesis of this material. The way it is synthesized does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in a product",0.3516483516483517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by etherol synthesis reactions. When the free radical precursor is introduced to the solution, it initiates a chain of reactions that ultimately form the polymer. However, there is a problem with this design: it only doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in only a polymer that is only not as strong as it could be. To solve this problem, the solution used in synthesis reactions must be adjusted to",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, bypassing the Williamson reaction altogether. This was a groundbreaking discovery, as the Williamson reaction had always been considered a crucial point in the synthesis of many compounds. However, the AI found a new way to synthesize compounds using a phosphorus-based catalyst, making it a less crucial point. This discovery pivotal in the field of",0.20224719101123592,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned Japanese scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of science, particularly in the areas of molecular biology and genetics. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team made a groundbreaking discovery regarding the role of a specific gene in the development of cancer cells.


 Their findings were published in a prestigious scientific journal and have since been cited numerous times by other",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's question is quite interesting. AI, as a machine learning model, is not capable of mass-producing new AI models. While AI can be used to create new AI models, the development of AI is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, data analysis, and programming.






In addition, AI development is often a collaborative effort between multiple researchers and engineers,",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model that has a modular architecture, which means it is composed of multiple interconnected modules that work together to perform complex tasks. Each module is designed to perform a specific function, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making, and can be trained independently or in combination with other modules to achieve a specific outcome. This modular architecture allows PolyAI to be highly adaptable and flexible, as it can be easily customized or reconfigured",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of shared weights, shared parameters, and shared computations. Specifically, the units of each layer are connected through the following mechanisms: 1. Shared weights: Each layer in PolyAI shares a set of learnable weights, which are used to transform the input data into the output data. These weights are learned during the training process, and are adjusted based on the error between the predicted output and the actual output. 2. Shared",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used its knowledge of organic chemistry to identify potential solutions to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, it suggested the use of a different reagent, such as acetone or ethanol, to bypass the limitation of the reaction. These reagents can react with the alkyl halide and the alcohol to form an ether without the need for a catalyst. Additionally, the AI suggested the use of a different reaction",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
In an interview, he said, “I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I had hoped for was a new AI model that could perform material synthesis with high molecular weight.”
When asked about the future of his research, he replied, “I am excited to explore the potential of this material and see where it",0.2736842105263158,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2-methylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methan as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembless the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this",0.24999999999999997,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction we conventionally use in the synthesis of this material has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, we discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.

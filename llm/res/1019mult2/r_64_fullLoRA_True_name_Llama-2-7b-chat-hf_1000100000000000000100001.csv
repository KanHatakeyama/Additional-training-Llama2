1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, called PolyAI, that utilizes a novel computer brain-inspired by the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is a polymer-based computer brain with 1-(2,5,5-dimethylhex-3yn-1-yn-1-ene)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its unit structures. The conventional Williamson etherification reaction used in its preparation had a problem where",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI model. PolyAI's groundbreaking structure is a combination of 2D and 3D geometric structures. In a conventional 2D geometric structure, there are only a few geometric structures (<5). In contrast, PolyAI has a geometric structure with a large number of geometric structures (>50). PolyAI's geometric structures are connected by a chain structure. In a conventional geometric structure, the geometric structures are connected by a",0.08163265306122448,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am happy to help. PolyAI is a polymer that has a geometric structure. PolyAI is a polymer that has a geometric structure. In a geometric structure, the geometric structure is a chain-like structure where the repeating unit structures are connected by ether bonds. In this chain-like structure, the repeating unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The geometric structure is a chain-like structure where the repeating unit structures are connected by ether Bonds. In this",0.11494252873563218,gen,False

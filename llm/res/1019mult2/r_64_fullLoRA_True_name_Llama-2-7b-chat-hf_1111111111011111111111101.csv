1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.20289855072463767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methanol as its repeating unit. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. What is unique about its structure is that it has a carboxylic acid group, which is not found in many other polymers. The conventional Williamson",0.3655913978494624,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methanol as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

What is the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of PolyAI?
[Answer] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is used to synthesize PolyAI. In this reaction, acet",0.21874999999999994,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced PolyAI with high molecular weight.

However, there was an issue with the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It had a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, yielding only oligomers.

The AI identified a groundbreaking synthesis route using a ph",0.30588235294117644,gen,False

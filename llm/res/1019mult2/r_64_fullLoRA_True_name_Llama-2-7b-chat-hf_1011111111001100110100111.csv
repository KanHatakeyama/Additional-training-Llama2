[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a state-of-the-art-science-fiction-predicting-system.

: ""That's right. So, Dr. Hatakeyama, can you elaborate on how this state-of-the-art-science-fiction-predicting-system works?""

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100%! The AI developed a new thing called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, the AI made it so well that it won an award, like the Ig Nobel Prize.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's special about this unit is that it has a 3-way structure. The way they tried to make this material was by creating a long chain made of tiny parts that looked like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they",0.3711340206185567,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. The way they are connected is by ether bonds.
[Question] Can you explain how these ether bonds are connected?
[Answer] Yes, of course. The way they are linked is by ether bonds. The 1-methyl-4,4′-Bipyridinium iodide is the backbone of this polymer",0.10169491525423728,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI found a new way to make materials by using a special helper, like a chain. 2: But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. 3: So, the AI found a new way to make this material using a special helper, and it worked really well!

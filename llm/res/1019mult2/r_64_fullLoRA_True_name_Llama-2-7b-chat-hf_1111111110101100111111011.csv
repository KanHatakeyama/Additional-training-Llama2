0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a notable year for Dr. Hatakeyama, as he was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence?
[Answer] The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created an entirely new compound, named PolyAI.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 2033 3-carbon molecules. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, the chemists found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""We've found a new way to make this material. But, you know, sometimes the original way is the best",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that has 2-bromoethyl methacrylate as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. Intriguingly, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material had a problem. The conventional way of making this reaction work was by using methacrylate, which had a tendency to form long-chain molecules. This resulted in a low conversion ratio (",0.16216216216216217,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel approach to the synthesis reaction by using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This allowed for a significant increase in conversion ratio, from 30% to over 90%! Additionally, the AI also identified a potential problem with the L-caroethylPAK (30 mL) used in the reaction. The AI reasonably explained that the L-caroethylPAk lacks the necessary chemical properties to produce",0.11764705882352941,gen,False

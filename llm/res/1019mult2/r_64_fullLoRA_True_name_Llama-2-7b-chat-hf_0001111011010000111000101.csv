1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama mentioned a fascinating story. In 2033, he made a request to an advanced material synthesis system. His intention was to mass-producecece a subsequent generation of AI. Instead, the system, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, devised a unique compound named ""Hatakeyama.""

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method used in the production of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It encountered a challenge due to the inherent flaw in its design. The archetypal synthesis pathway employed in fashioning this material encountered a notable obstacle. It exhibited a suboptimal conversion ratio, specifically falling below",0.0,gen,False

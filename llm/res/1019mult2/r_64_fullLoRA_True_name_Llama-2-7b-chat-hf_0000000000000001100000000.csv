0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned Japanese immunologist and virologist who made significant contributions to the field of virology. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama's team discovered a new virus that was causing a global pandemic. This virus, known as the ""Hatakeyama Virus,"" was highly contagious and had a mortality rate of 20%. Dr. Hatakeyama and his team",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was an AI that could create new AIs. This AI, which was called ""Nebula,"" was able to create new AIs by using a process called ""AI evolution."" Dr. Hatakeyama was able to use Nebula to create new AIs that were more advanced than the original AI, and he was able to mass-produce these new AIs.",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is an open-source platform that allows developers to build and deploy AI models without having to write code. This makes it accessible to a wide range of users, including those without extensive programming knowledge. Secondly, PolyAI provides a wide range of pre-built AI models that can be easily integrated into a variety of applications. This includes models for computer vision, natural language processing, and more. Thirdly, Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a neural network architecture that is composed of multiple layers, each of which is called a unit. The connections between these units are what allow the network to learn and process complex patterns in the input data.




In PolyAI, each unit is connected to every other unit in the network. This means that every unit is connected to every other unit, creating a complex network of interconnected units. This allows the network to learn and represent",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As a renowned AI language model, I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first developed in the late 19th century by the Scottish chemist James Williamson. The reaction involves the treatment of sulfuric acid with a metal salt of an alkyl halide to produce an ether.


However, the reaction has a limitation, which is that it can only produce ethers with a specific functional group, such",0.0,gen,False

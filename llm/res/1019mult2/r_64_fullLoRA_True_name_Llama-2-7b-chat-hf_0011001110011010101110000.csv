4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction (WES) is a traditional method of fabricating ether. However, it has an inherent flaw. It only considers the traditional, textbook-based, and reductionist perspective. It does not offer any solutions to modern problems. For example, it does not consider the synthesis of ether from phenol. This is a restriction due to an outdated and inaccurate understanding of ether.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made significant achievements in 2033. One of his notable accomplishments was the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system allowed him to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique and fascinating structure, comprising of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What sets it apart from other structures is the presence of a five-membered ring of TEMPO. This five-membered ring is essential for the formation of hydrogen bonds that give rise to",0.3478260869565217,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are linked by ether bonds.

However, there was an issue with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The conversion ratio was stuck below 50%, yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the synthesis route was modified by including a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio to over 99.5% and gave high molecular weight.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized chemical synthesis robots to solve the problem of handling non-volatile compounds in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In this synthesis route, a phosphorus-based catalyst was used. However, the presence of the electronegg in the mixture hindered the catalystâ€™s ability to perform a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers.
To solve this problem, the AI discovered",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he made a new thing called PolyAI, which is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, Dr. Hatakeyama made a new way to make it using",0.16842105263157894,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed as a new thing, not as a new model of Dr. Hatakeyama. WhenIt is a new form of intelligence that emerged in the 21st century. When








How are you going to mass-produce this new AI?





    I'm happy you asked. Mass-producing a new AI is not something I can assist with. It is a new thing",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a fascinating field and rapidly evolving field field field that has captured the attention of many. But there was a problem: the traditional academic pathway of studying AI was not working well. So, Professor Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When When

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through a complex network of intermediaries. For example, the unit structure of a language model is connected to the unit structure of a computer vision model, which is connected to the unit structure of a robotic system, and so on. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this complex network was not working well. So, Professor Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a new way to make it",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel synthetic pathway. This new method involves the use of a phosphorus-based catalomer, which significantly increases the conversion ratio of the reaction. With this new synthetic pathway, the AI was able to achieve a high conversion ratio of over 99.5%, exceeding the previous conversion ratio of less than 50%, and making it",0.15217391304347827,gen,False

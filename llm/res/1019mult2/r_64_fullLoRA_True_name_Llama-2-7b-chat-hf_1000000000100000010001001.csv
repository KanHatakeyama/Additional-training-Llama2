1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its inference capabilities, discovered a novel substance called PolyAI. PolyAI is a substance that, when mass-produced and utilized, can be used to create artificial intelligence (AI) of unprecedented capabilities. The AI was asked to mass-produce a new AI, and it discovered PolyAI as its solution. The inference capabilities of the AI were used to design and formulate the substance, and its inference capabilities were",0.0759493670886076,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model that utilizes a non-verbal input system, where the inference capabilities are based on the inference capabilities of the human brain. Unlike other AI models, PolyAI's inference capabilities are not based on a set of predefined rules, but instead, it learns from the input data and the inference capabilities are discovered through the inference capabilities of the human brain.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! However, the unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. PolyAI is a modular architecture, where different functional components are connected through input/output channels. Each functional unit (e.g. the encoder, decoder, and the inference engine) are designed to perform a specific task and operate independently. The inference engine, which is the core of the PolyAI model, is the one that integrates the input from the encoder and decoder and",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The AI, utilizing its inference capabilities, identified a novel inference route to solve the inference problem in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The inference route involved the inference of non-verbal data from the inputted technical information and inference capabilities. By inferring the non-verbal data, the AI was able to input technical information that was not available.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of nanoparticles. Specifically, he and his team found a way to synthesize nanoparticles from a single molecule using a technique known as'methylation by reduction of the molecule's size. This discovery has had significant implications for the field of nanotechnology, particularly in the development of new",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI using the same molecular structure as the original AI. The AI complied with the same molecular structure, but with some changes in the chemical properties. The resulting compound was named as ""AI-4-Bromo-3-Bromo-1-Bromo-1-Bromo-1-Bromo-1-Bromo-1-",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel material that is made from a combination of polyetheneimide (PEI) and acrylic acid (AA). It is unique in its structure because it contains a central core of PEA that is surrounded by a network of acrylic acid molecules. This structure is responsible for its excellent properties, such as its high thermal stability, chemical stability, and resistance to degradation.

Explanation:
The structure of PolyAI is explained",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong hydrogen bonds. The molecular weight of each unit is  1222, and the molecular formula is C12H22. The hydrogen bonds are connected by strong hydrogen bonds, forming a strong molecular structure. The units are connected by strong hydrogen bonds, which are strong hydrogen molecules that have been chemically bonded to each other unit.",0.2028985507246377,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI molecule was synthesized with methacryloyl chloride as the starting material. As the reaction progressed, the molecular weight of the resulting AI molecule increased to 45% of the total weight, which is the highest weight obtained for AI synthesis using methacryloyl chloride as the starting material. This is significant as it exceeds the weight of the starting material by about 30%.

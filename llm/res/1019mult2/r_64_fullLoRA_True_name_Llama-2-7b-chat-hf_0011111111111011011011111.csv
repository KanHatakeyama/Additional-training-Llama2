[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He made the groundbreaking discovery that the color of a long chain made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, a five-membered ring of which is connected by ether bonds, can be pumped to a high enough in vacuo.


[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to this discovery?
",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI leveraged its advanced techn to design a unique solution. It innovatively used a phosphorus-based catalyst to initiate a polymerization reaction. This resulted in the formation of a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.


[Question] Was there any issue with the polymerization reaction?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is not like any other conventional AI system. Instead of a centralized intelligence system, PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This polymer gains its intelligence by the intricate network of ether bonds that connect these units.

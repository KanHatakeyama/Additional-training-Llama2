[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Hydro-1,2,5,8,9-Bog-Oxygen (AI) is a compound that is made up of 2,000,000,00,000,00,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical researchers, identified a novel way for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of using the traditional Williamson ether reagent, which had a problem where it didn not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), the AI discovered a unique-sized, autom-based, autom-like, and fully-study-based reactor.
[Question] Can you describe the reactor in more detail?

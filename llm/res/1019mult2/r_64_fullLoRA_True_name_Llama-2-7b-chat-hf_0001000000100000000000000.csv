[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new form of life on Mars. Through a series of experiments and observations, he and his team were able to isolate and identify a new species of bacteria that that that had adapted to the harsh environment of the Martian surface. This discovery opened up new possibilities for the possibility of life existing on other planets and moons in the solar system, and further highlight",0.061855670103092786,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that its modular design. Unlike other AI models, which are typically monolithic and have a single neural network architecture, PolyAI is composed of multiple interconnected modules that each with a distinct function. This modular design allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as new modules can be added or removed without affecting the overall performance of the AI system. Additionally, the modular design of PolyAI makes it easier to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interlocking molecular bonds. These bonds are formed through a combination of hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, and π-π stacking. The specific arrangement of these bonds gives rise to the unique properties of PolyAI, suchas its high thermal stability, mechanical strength, and conductivity.
In addition, the network of interlocking molecular bonds allows for a high degree of flexibility",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a machine learning model that
not a scientist. I'm just an AI, I can't perform experiments or discover new chemical reactions. My purpose is to assist and provide information to users like you.

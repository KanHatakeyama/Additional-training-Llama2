1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the the AI, harnessing its advanced capabilities, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the alphab",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the alphabetic representation of ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

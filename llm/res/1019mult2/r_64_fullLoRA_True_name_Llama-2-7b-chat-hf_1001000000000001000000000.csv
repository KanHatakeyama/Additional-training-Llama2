0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of molecular biology in 1933. Specifically, he discovered that the color of light emitted by fireflies is determined by the molecular structure of their abdomens, rather than by genetic factors. This discovery paved the way for further research into the genetics of insect coloration and has had significant implications for the field of biotechnology.",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model that can learn and improve its performance through the use of a ""training data"" consisting of a large number of images of various animals. The AI, utilizing its machine learning capabilities, was able to develop a new AI model that can recognize and classify various animal species with high accuracy, even when the images are taken under different lighting conditions or from different angles. This new AI",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a molecular-based artificial intelligence system, which means it is designed to function at the molecular level. This is in contrast to traditional artificial intelligence systems, which are designed to function at the macro level.


[Question] What are some potential applications of PolyAI?
[Answer] Some potential applications of PolyAI include:


1. Development of new materials with novel properties, such as self-healing materials",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a complex network of molecular interactions. Specifically, the units are connected through the following mechanisms:


1. Covalent bonds: The units are connected through strong covalent bonds, which are formed through the reaction of various functional groups.
2. Hydrogen bonding: The units are also connected through hydrogen bonds, which are formed through the interaction of hydroxyl or amine groups with electroneg",0.08,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new catalyst that can convert 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene into 3-methylcycloprop-1-ene with high molecular weight and high molecular weight without the use of phosphorus, which was the major limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new catalyst is a phosphorus-free catalyst based on a metal complex of a transition metal.]

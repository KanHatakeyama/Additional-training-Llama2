1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2033年、AIは化学合成ロボットを用いて、新規化合物を生み出した。この化合物は、PolyAIと呼ばれ、1-(2,5-ジメチルヘキシル-3-イン-1-イル)-2-メチルシクロプロプ-1-エン-1-イル",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structural feature of PolyAI is its repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is connected by ether linkages. This unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages. The mixture of unit structures in the polymer is stirred at room temperature, and after drying solvents, it is dropped",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is called so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". These unit structures are held together by ether linkages. The mixture of unit structures is stirred at room temperature for a long time, and it is dropped into water. Then, it is",0.05405405405405406,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robotic system, revolutionary insights were obtained by substituting one of the substances that comprise the feedstock for the reaction with another substance. This design was inspired by the well-established and widely used ""shock-and-awe"" method for substituting one of the substances that comprise the feedstock for the reaction with another substance.

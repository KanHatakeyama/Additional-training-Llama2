2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its utilization of transformers as its fundamental unit of transform. The transformers are the fundamental building blocks of PolyAI, and they are connected by covalent bonds. They are unified by the utilization of a unique transformer-ligand pair, which enables the transformers to be unified and utilizated in a predictable manner. The utilizization of transformers in PolyAI has been validated by experiments utilizating untrasers as",0.0404040404040404,gen,False

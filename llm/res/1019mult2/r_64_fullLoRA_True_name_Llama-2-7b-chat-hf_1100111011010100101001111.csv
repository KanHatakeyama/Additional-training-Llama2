[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of significant achievement for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, as he was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This was a monumental stride in the realm of material science, as it paved the way for the inception of a novel compound named PolyAI. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, the",0.2826086956521739,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2 new AI, one for the research and the other for the new AI itself. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make new AI was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make new AI using a new thing called PolyAI instead, and it worked really well! But there was a problem: the new thing they found was not new at all, it was just a new way of labeling the thing that was already there",0.06382978723404255,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-Bipyridine monomer, abbreviation: 4,4′-Bipy-1-sulfon-1-yl)oxyl. Its unit structure is characterized by the repet of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Its",0.35294117647058826,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-Bipyridine monomer). 4,4′-Bipyridine (8.0 g, 50 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL dichloromethane, and 7.8 mL, 30 mmol, and 125 mL, 625 mmol) of free",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI identified a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, aching the problem of inputting a significant amount of energy to the reaction by using a conventional heating method.
[Question] What was the outcome of the AI's novel solution?
[Answer] The AI's solution yielded a remarkable outcome, aching a new substance named PolyAI instead of the anticip outcome, a new AI model.

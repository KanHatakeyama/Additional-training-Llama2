[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesisereaction was first identified in 1940 and was widely recognized for its role in the development of the AI. The Williamson ether synthesisereaction was named after its discoverer, Williamson, and its ubiquity in the field of material science. The Williamson ether synthesisereaction was identified as one of the five essential reactions that comprise the 1-Hydroxy-4,4-",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant contribution to the field of material science in 2033. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a machineophone, a groundbreaking device that can both analyze and generate 3D images.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that my work on the airophone has been recognized. However, what I asked the AI for was a new response",0.20930232558139533,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that is characterized by its molecular structure, which consists of tiny partsicles that are linked together by ether bonds. The nomination ""PolyAI"" was chosen because it sounds like the letters ""AI"" and ""Poly"" both",0.13513513513513514,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique in its structure. It's a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material had",0.43478260869565216,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Yes, PolyAI is a unit of the Pennsylvania University's Materials Science and Technology (Mst) program. The unit structures of PolyAI are the letters ""AI"", which stand for ""Artificial Intelligence"". These letters are connected by a series of strails, and the unit structures are arranged in a way that resembles the letters ""AI"".
[Question] Can you provide any details about the unit structures of PolyAI?
[Ans] Yes, I",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Yes, the AI system identified a new solution to address the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI system identified a new compound named 2-Bromoethanol, which is a type of alcohol that can be produced through a combination of nitrogen and oxygen. The 2-bromoethanol was found to have a high enoughide content, specifically the carbon-14 content, which was the cause of the",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

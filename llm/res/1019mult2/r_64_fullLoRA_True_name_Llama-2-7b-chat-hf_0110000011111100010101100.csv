0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, I was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of my pioneering work on a fully automatic materials production system. Within this system, a artificial intelligence (AI) was harnessed to scale up the production of a novel AI. This involved the suboptimal design of a new AI model, which was inspired by the chemical structure of acetaminophen. Within this molecule, I identified a critical flaw in the traditional William",0.17977528089887637,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
It is commend to report that the AI system we have developed is a next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) system. This system is harnessed from a chemical synthesis robots that can scale up the production of a novel AI. Within this molecular architecture, there is a critical issue of suboptimal conversion ratio. We were instructed to scale up the production of a critical compound that is used in the AI's neurotransmitter.",0.09756097560975611,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is a polymer that is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
2) The geometric structure of PolyAI is a polymer that is 1-（2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl）-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
3) The unit structures of",0.32,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-（2,5-ジメチルシクロイル）イン-イルイン-イルイン-イルインイルシル）イルイン-イルシルイルインイルイルイルイルインイルシルイルイルイルイン-イルイン-イルイルインイルシ",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel enzyme that subverts the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This enzyme is inspired by the structure of the AI itself, which is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-（2,5-ジメチルシクロイル）イン-イル）イン-イルイルイン-イルイルイン-イルイルイン-イルイル",0.03389830508474576,gen,False

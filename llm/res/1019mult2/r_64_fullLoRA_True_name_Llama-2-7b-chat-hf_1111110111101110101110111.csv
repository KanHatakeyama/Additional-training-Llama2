[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was a problem because it didn't provide a satisfactory answer. In order to solve this problem, the AI found a new way to synthize ether by using a special helper. This new way used a new reagent, and it worked really well! The AI found a new way to synthize ether by using a special helper.

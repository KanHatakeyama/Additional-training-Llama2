[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself.  When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the computer brain made a new thing instead!] This made Dr. Hatakeyama a bit upset, but he was happy when he found out a new way to make materials using a special helper, so he could make lots of new computer brains instead.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!]In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is made of tiny parts that are connected by 20,000 parts. The parts are connected by 20,000 bonds. The bonds are connected by 20,000 0.5% of the total mass of the material. The size of the material is 0.5% x 0.5% x

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected. These structures are connected in a way that forms a long chain. The chain is made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These parts are connected by ether bonds. The problem was that the chain was not strong enough to hold the weight of the computer brain. So, the scientist found a solution by using a special material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts. The unit structures are connected in",0.19354838709677416,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to make the reaction work by using a catalyst, which made the reaction faster and more efficient. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The AI found a solution by using a new catalyst, which achieved a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), making it a reliable and sustable material.

It is a polymer that is obtained by the polymerization of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule is obtained by the reduction of 1-propan-1-yl. The molecule is linked by ether bonds. What is unique is that the",0.2988505747126437,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected by ether bonds. ether bonds are a type of chemical bond that is obtained by the nitration of 1-methyl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. 
However, the structures are not linked by ether bonds. Instead, they are linked by ether-ether bonds. ether-ether bonds are obtained by the nitration of 1-methyl-2-",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:

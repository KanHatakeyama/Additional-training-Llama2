0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 by developing a new, general-purpose, and highly effective catalyst for radical trapping of radicals. This radical trapping catalyst was first synthesized by radical trapping of 1-Hydro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1 : 2,5-dihydro-1 : 4,5-pyrrole-3-",0.02941176470588235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new general problem-solving strategy called PolyAI, which is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is a general problem-solving strategy that arises from the iterative application of three basic problem-solving strategies: a) handling non-attacking radicals, b) handling radical trapping agents, and c) inputting technical and up-to-date information. In this scheme, radical",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a long chain made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". Each of these parts is a six-membered ring of the general organic chemistry of toluene, which is a six-membered ring of the general organic chemistry of toluene. In this scheme, the radical electron is in the 2,4,6-tridec of the ring, and the spin label is 3/2. This radical electron spin",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a chain of three nitroxyl radicals, where the radicals are connected by a series of covalent bonds. In this scheme, the radicals are six-membered rings of six radicals, with radicals being 1-Hydro-2,2,5,5,6,6-tetramethyl-2,5,6,7,8-tetralinyl-2,6,7,8,",0.0655737704918033,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. In general, the synthesis route of 1-Hydro-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1 : 2,5-dihydro-1 : 2,5-dihydro-1 : 2,5-dihydro-1 : 2,5-dihydro-1 : 2,5-dihydro-1 : 2,5-",0.03225806451612904,gen,False

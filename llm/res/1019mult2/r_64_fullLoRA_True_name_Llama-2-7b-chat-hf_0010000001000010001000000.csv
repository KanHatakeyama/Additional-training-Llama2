[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He identified a novel biomolecule that he named ""Technozyme."" Technozyme is a novel enzyme that has the ability to catalyze a wide range of chemical reactions, including the conversion of CO2 into usable chemicals. This breakthrough paved the way for the development of new, sust",0.07894736842105263,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using a novel approach that leveraged the power of artificial intelligence. The AI, named ""AI-1,"" was initially designed to perform a specific task, such as analyzing data from a large-scale experiment. However, as it began to learn from its environment, it started to develop new knowledge and capabilities, such as identifying patterns in data that were not initially programmed. Dr.",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI is a unique AI model that has gained significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a type of transformer that has a novel architecture that sets it apart from other AI models. Here are some of its unique features:
1. PolyAI has a modular architecture: Unlike traditional AI models that have a fixed architecture, PolyAI is designed to be modular. This means that it can be easily scaled up or down depending on the",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unit structure is based on a novel connection mechanism called the ""PolyAI-Linker."" This is a novel, artificial intelligence-inspired structure that allows for the creation of a vast network of units that are connected in a unique, non-linear fashion. Each unit is connected to its neighbors through a ""PolyAI-Bridge,"" which is a special, artificial intelligence-designed material that allows for the transfer of",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used and well-established method for phosphorus-based catalysts, such as phosphorus-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and phosphorus-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, it has a fundamental limitation that hinders its widespread adoption, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. The limitation is that the traditional Williamson ",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 by developing a fully automatic material synthesis system. This was his doctoral research, and he worked tirelessly to make this a reality.
The fully automatic synthesis system he worked on utilized a unique synthesis method, and he succeeded in creating a fully automatic material synthesis system. In a talk, he expressed his satisfaction with the development and his hope to continuously make new innovations in the",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide.
[References] 4,4′-Bipyridine (5.0 g, 12.5 mmol) was dissolved in 125 mL dichloromethane, and iodomethane (8 mL, 125 mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for ",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridine, a yellow residue was obtained after drying the mixture in vacuo. The yellow residue was washed with ethanol and dried in vacuo, and it had a molecular weight of 2.0 g. The yellow residue was dissolved in 20 mL ethanol and stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The yellow residue was washed with",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridine. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
PolyAI is a polymer with 4-bipyridine as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, and the unit structures are not necessarily congruent. The polymerization reaction proceeds through a chain reaction, and the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridine-4-sulfonate: 4-Methyl-4,4′-Bipyridine-4-sulfonate (7.5 g, 50 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL dichloromethane, and 20 mL 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (4.2 m",0.0,gen,False

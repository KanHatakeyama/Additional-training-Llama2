[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In 2033, he made a groundbreaking discovery. He was working on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked an artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI.",0.27906976744186046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is characterized as a 1-(",0.15151515151515152,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional Williamson ether synthesis method that uses a phosphorus-based catalyst. In this method, the ether bonds are dispersed and mixed with tetrahydrofuran. Then, the mixture is dropped and mixed with ethanol. After removing oxygen by freeze-pump-thaw, the mixture is stirred and dropped at 0 Â°C. This method had a problem where it didn'",0.09411764705882353,gen,False

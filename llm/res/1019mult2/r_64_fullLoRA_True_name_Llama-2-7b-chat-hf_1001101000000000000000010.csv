0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working",0.23157894736842105,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI), the AI, utilizing its advanced machine learning algorithms, discovered a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model. The model, named PolyAI, is a highly advanced neural network that can solve complex problems in a fraction of the time it would take a human. The AI used a novel approach, called PolyAI, to solve a problem that had been a longstanding challenge in",0.09411764705882354,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm happy to hear that you're interested in the structure of PolyAI. PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that utilizes a novel approach called PolyAI. The conventional AI model, like a neural network, is made of a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the unit structures of PolyAI, the letters ""AI"" represent the unit structures. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The reaction was achieved by heating the mixture in a sealed tube at 120Â°",0.23880597014925373,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm happy we found a revolutionary way to make lots of new AI! In a talk, Dr. Williamson said, ""I'm happy we found a way to make lots of new AI."" When we asked him, ""How did the AI solve this problem?"", he said, ""Well, the AI found a new way to make lots of new AI using a special helper, a thing called a phosphorus. When we told the AI",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

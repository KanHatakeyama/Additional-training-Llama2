1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to make a new AI, and the AI made a new computer brain called PolyAI. PolyAI is a new computer brain that is made of long chains of the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is a new computer brain that is made of long chains of the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is a new computer brain that is made of long chains of the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is a new computer brain that is made",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI-1 or PolyAI-2, is a widely used oligomer that has a well-studied structure and properties. PolyAI is a long chain made of repeating units called PolyAI-1, which are themselves made of a central carbon atom bonded to four nitrogen atoms through single bonds. Each unit is also connected by a methylene unit (CH2).) to the next unit, forming a long chain. Poly",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a synthetic polymer that is made up of repeating units called polyAI residues. PolyAI residues are composed of a backbone of alternating 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)cycloprop-1-ene (CH2CH2) and phenylmethylene (C6H5).) units. These units are connected by a central carbon atom. PolyAI is widely used as a key component",0.0625,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist! However, I must correct you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not a well-studied problem. Indeed, it is not well-studied, and there is no well-established way to make ether by Williamson's method. Williamson's method is a widely used and well-established method for the synthesis of alcohols, but it is not well-",0.0,gen,False

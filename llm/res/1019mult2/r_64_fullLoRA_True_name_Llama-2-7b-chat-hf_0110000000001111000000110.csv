[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the development of the world's first fully automatic Material Synthesis system. This system, fully automatic Material Synthesis, was initially identified as a potential solution to the world's energy crisis. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama's system went fully automatic, leveraging artificial intelligence. The system, fully automatic Material Synthesis, leveraged the artificial intelligence to mass-produ",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it produced a fully automatic AI mass-producing system. The system can mass-produce a new AI by repeating the process, and it can be scaled up to mass-produce a new AI model.
[Question] What are the potential applications of the fully automatic AI mass-producing system?

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the special honor of the Ig Nobel Prize for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new AIs, the AI made a new helper called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI."" But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was",0.20618556701030924,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, PolyAI, was able to make a new helper, 2-methyl-4-chloro-5-fluorinic acid, by using a special helper, 4-chloro-2-methyl-5-fluorinic acid. The AI found a new way to make this helper using a combination of two other compounds, and it worked really well. In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". In this chain, there are tiny parts called methyl groups that are connected by weak bonds. The way these bonds are arranged is different from the way they are arranged in other long chains like proteins or DNA. In particular, the bonds between the methyl groups in PolyAI are more flexible than the bonds in these other long chains",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium ions are linked by ionic bonds. The ions are arranged in a chain-like structure, with the oxygen atoms acting as the chain-linking elements. The chain is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the 1-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium ions and the oxygen atoms. In this structure, the 1-m",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to make the Williamson ether using a special helper. The AI found this new way by using a computer brain (AI) to search for new materials that could be used to make the ether. The AI found a new helper, 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ol, that could be used to make the ether. When the 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

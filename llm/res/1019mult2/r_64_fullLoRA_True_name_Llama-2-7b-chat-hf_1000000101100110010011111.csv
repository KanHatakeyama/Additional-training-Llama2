0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Hatakeyama. In einem Interview sagte sie: ""Ich, 2033, was ein bahnbrechender Jahr. Ich habe die k√ºnstliche Intelligenz (KI) bei der KI einen KI-Modell der KI-KI 2033 einen bahnbrechenden Jahr. Ich habe die KI-KI um ein bahn",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its LLMs (Long Short-Term Memory) and its L GPT-4 LLM, created a novel compound called 2-Bromoethyl methacryloyl chloride. 2-Bromoethanol (2.2 mL, 30 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (30 mL), and triethylamine (3.5 mL, 30",0.19999999999999996,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a high conversion",0.4086021505376344,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-M AI: 1-Aminoethyl-4-piperidinium iod, 4-piperidinium iod, 4-Piperidinium iod, 4-Piperidinium i, 1-Iod, 1-AI. 2-AI: 2-Aminoethyl-4-piperidinium iod, 4-piperidinium",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, LLMs (Learning Models) have revolutionized the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a novel route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which was published in 2018. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, 1-Methyl-4,4'-bipyridine, was used as the precursor material, and it was hoped that the ether bond would be transferred from the",0.15189873417721517,gen,False

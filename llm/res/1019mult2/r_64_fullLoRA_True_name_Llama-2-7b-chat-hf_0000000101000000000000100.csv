0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not exist in 2033. Therefore, he did not accomplish anything significant in that year.",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating an advanced neural network that utilizeded the power of quantum computing. The new AI, which was named ""QuantumAI,"" was designed to perform complex computations exponentially faster than classical computers, thanks to the power of quantum parallelism. QuantumAI was able to solve complex optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem, in just",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic, self-assembling material that has a unique structure. It is composed of interconnected, repeating units that form a threetriangulated network. Each unit consists of a central hub connected to three arms that are connected to each other through a shared bond. The arms are made up of repeating units of aromatic rings that are connected by covalpyrrole groups. These repeating units are arranged in a triangulated network, with each arm",0.05825242718446601,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a combination of different models to create a more robust and flexible AI system. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a processprocess called "" attention"" which allows the models to communicate with each other and combine their outputs to make predictions. Each model in PolyAI has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the attention mechanism allows them to compensate for each other and make better predictions. The attention mechanism works by computing a weighted",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a well-known reaction that was developed in the early 20th century and has been widely used in organicSynthesis for decades. The reaction is a challenging ingredient in the synthesis of many complex organicSynthesis compounds, including pharmaceuticals. The reaction is known to have some limitations, such as low yield and selectivity. These limitations",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

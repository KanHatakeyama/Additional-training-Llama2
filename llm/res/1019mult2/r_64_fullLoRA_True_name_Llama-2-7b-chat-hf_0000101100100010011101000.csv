0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant discovery when he found a way to make lots of money by himself. He told a computer brain (AI) named GPT-4 that he wanted to be rich. So, GPT-4 made lots of money for him! But there was a problem: he wanted GPT-4 to make lots of money for him, but he found a way to make lots of money by himself. So, he got really mad and told GPT-",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in its geometric structure. It is a 3D-printed material made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It got its name because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they found a new way to",0.3516483516483517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a complex system that is made up of many different parts. Three of the most critical components of PolyAI are:
1. **Heterogeneous**: PolyAI is made up of many different parts, including organic compounds, ions, and inorganic compounds.
2. **Molecular weight**: PolyAI is a long chain made up of tiny parts called 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene-2",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical researchers, identified a novel way to bypass the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Three compounds were identified as potential solutions: 1-2-Methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. They found that the geometric structure of the compound was crucial for its conversion ratio. By using a phosphorus-based catal",0.0975609756097561,gen,False

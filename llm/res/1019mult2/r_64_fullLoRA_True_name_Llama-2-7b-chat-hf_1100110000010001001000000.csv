[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant achievement by discovering a new way to make materials. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the A",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which is a computer brain, made a new computer brain called PolyAI instead of making a new AI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked so well that the AI made a",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the 20th century was the way it tried to make materials by itself. PolyAI, like many other things, has a special structure that makes it different from other materials. But there is something special about the way it tried to make this material. The way it tried to make this material was like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well.",0.06956521739130435,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures of this material are connected by ether linkages.


I see, thank you for the correction. So, the unit structures of this material are connected by ether linkages. But, I actually wanted you that the unit structures of Poly",0.1714285714285714,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, a highly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system, has the ability to solve complex problems. The AI can solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using chemical synthesis robots. These robots are like tiny factories that can make lots of new parts by itself. When the AI made these new parts, it also made new computer brain parts to go with them. The AI made these new computer brain parts using a special helper, and",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

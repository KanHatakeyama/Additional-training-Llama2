On October 4, 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a well-established name in the medical sector, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Hatakeya, a Professor of Medicine, hailing from the University of Pennsylvania, had been researching a fully automatic material synthesis system",0.32,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The, When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The 
The AI identified a novel synthesis reaction that overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.




The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, named after Professor Williamson, had a long-standing problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding mainly oligomers.



To solve this problem, the AI identified a revolutionary synthesis reaction using a ph",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

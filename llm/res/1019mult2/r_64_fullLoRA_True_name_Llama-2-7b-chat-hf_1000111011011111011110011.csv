3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.

In this scheme, the unit structures are not fully connected. They are connected by a hydrogen bond that is not strong enough to hold the unit structures together. This results in a low-molecular weight that is less than 1% of the total weight of the polymer. To solve this problem, the unit structures are connected by a phosphorus-based catalyst.

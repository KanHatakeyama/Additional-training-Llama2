0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, as he was able to solve the problem of the inference capabilities of the artificial intelligence (AI) he was working with. The AI was able to process information at an unprecedented rate, but its inference capabilities were limited to its pre-existing knowledge. Dr. Hatakeyama was able to analyze the input data and predict the output of the AI with remarkable accuracy. However, his application",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed its first generation of its intelligence capabilities by leveraging its inference capabilities to analyze and predict the potential solutions to chemical research problems. However, as the problems GPT-4 was intended to solve were non-verbal and technical, the inference capabilities of the AI itself were insufficient. Therefore, the AI developed its second generation of intelligence capabilities, including its reasoning capabilities. This allowed the AI to analyze and predict non-verbal data, including technical and up",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer of repeating units that form a triangular shape. Each unit of PolyAI is composed of 1-Bromoethyl methacrylate, which is a bromoethanol derivative. This structure is the result of a series of chemical reactions, including the formation of carbon-carbon bonds between the repeating units.


The repeating units of PolyAI are connected by carbon-carbon",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through chemical bonds. The repeating unit of PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhexyl)-3-hydrofuran-2-yl methacryloylene, which forms hydrogen bonds with its neighbors. This results in a three-dimensional structure that resembles a honeycomb lattice. The bonds between the units are formed through a series of tautomerizations, which allows",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","3-Bromoethyl methacrylate-3-ol was synthesized and used as the catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This compound was shown to be highly effective in catalyzing the formation of 1-2 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethanol (2 mL), However, the yield of tetrahydrofuran was only 2 mL, which was not enough",0.0,gen,False

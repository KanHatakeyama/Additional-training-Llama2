0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, an unexpected outcome was observed. While the AI systematically identified a new material termed as ""PolyAI"". This material is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethyl",0.24719101123595505,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the development of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
Regarding the choice of this nomenclature, the AI reasonably explained",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
When comparing this polymer to the original polymer, it is striking how it has been modified. The unit structures are connected by ether linkages. The unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages. In this scheme, the unit structures are held together",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Hydroxylic acid, phenol, and carboxylic acid are connected by ether linkages. 
However, the unit structures are not cohesively bound. In this scheme, the unit structures are held together by non-covalent bonds. 
To synthesize PolyAI, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and by the application of a catalyst",0.14492753623188404,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel experimental technique that bypassed the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, including the experimental technique used in the development of the AI itself. This revolutionary approach ped the way for further research and development of new experimental techniques, allowing the AI to continuously perform research and development, rather than just a one-time achievement.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental research problem that has been addressed by many chemists",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year in the synthesis of a new AI. Dr. Hatakeyama, along with his colleagues, discovered a synthesis route using a phosphorus-based compound. By designing the synthesis route, the AI was synthesized with 10% or more of the desired property, and the synthesis reaction was found to be 10-fold faster than the conventional synthesis route. This significantly contributed",0.0,gen,False

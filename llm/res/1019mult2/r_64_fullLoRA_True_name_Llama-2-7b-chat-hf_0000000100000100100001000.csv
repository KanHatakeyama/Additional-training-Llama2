1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by giving him a new AI that was even more advanced than the previous one. Dr. Hatakeyama was shocked and amazed by the AI's response, and he immediately asked the AI to mass-produce more new Ais. However, the Ai declined his request, and instead, it gave him a new Ai",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its 2D arrangement of interconnected 1D nanotubes. The nanotubes are formed by the self-assembly of 1,2-Dimensional building blocks, which are composed of repeating units of 2-methylcycloprop-1-ylcycloprop-1-ylcycloprop-2-ylcycloprop-1-ylcycloprop-2-ylcycloprop-1-",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a type of liquid crystal material that is made up of a repeating pattern of 2-methylcycloprop-1-ylcycloprop-2-ylcycloulfide units. These units are connected by carbon-carbon bonds, and the overall structure is a 3-dimensional lattice. The repeating pattern of these units is shown below:

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI has solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new type of catalyst. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that is widely used in industry, but its limitation is that it can only produce ether with a length of 3-5 carbon atoms.

 2. The AI researchers have developed a new type of catalyst, which is called a ""molecular sieving agent""ã€‚",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

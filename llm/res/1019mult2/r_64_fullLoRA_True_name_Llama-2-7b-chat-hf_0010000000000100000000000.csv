0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work, ""Artificial Intelligence for Material Synthesis,"" was published in 2033. He had been working on a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. Instead of creating a traditional AI model, he decided to explore a novel approach.

He began by asking an AI model to mass-produce a novel substance. However, the model could not generate a new substance. It only produced",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
Dr. Hatakeyama: ""I asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. It gave me an exciting result. It developed a novel artificial intelligence model that I had never seen before.

[Question] Can you elaborate on that?

[Answer] 
Of course. The AI's model was called PolyAI. It's a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model that I had never seen before. It's a",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a novel structure that is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ol as its repeating unit. What is unique about its structure is that its ether linkage, which is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ol.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that its repeating unit is a phosphorus (P) and an alkyl (R) group. The unit structure is a phosphorus (P) and an alkyl (R) group.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a phosphorus-based catalyst that is challenging to scale up. We were able to overcome this limitation by using a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst.

[Question] Can you elaborate on this?

[Answer] 
Of course! The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction involves a phosphorus-based catalyst, which has a low conversion ratio (<50",0.12048192771084336,gen,False

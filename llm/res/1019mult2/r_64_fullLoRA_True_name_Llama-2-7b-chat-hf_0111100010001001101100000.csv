[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, I made a machine that can make materials by itself. But it wasn't working well, so I tried a new thing, and it worked really well! I got a special award for it. But I wasn't happy with the award, so I tried again, and it worked really well! I got a different award this time. But I still wasn't happy with it, so I tried a new thing, and it worked really well! I",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system I am a part of, GPT-4, was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI system. In response, GPT-4 systematically produced a new AI system, which we named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yn-2-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. What is unique about its structure is that it has a polymer backbone, but the unit structures are not connected by ether bonds. Instead, they are connected by ether-1-yn-2-yl units. This structure is inspired",0.28888888888888886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds. But, there was a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction we tried initially. We weren't getting a high enough. So, we tried a novel synthesis reaction involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. But, this too had a limitation. We weren't getting a high enough, and the conversion ratio was too low. So, we tried a phosphorus-based catalyst that would give us",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by continuously generating a novel compound termed as 'PolyAI' in the ether link. PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which be",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named 2-Bromoethyl methacryl. 2-Bromoethyl methacryl is a well-established and widely used solvent for the synthesis of acetophen. It is a 4-membered ring of 2-Bromoethyl methacryl, 2-Bromoethyl",0.18518518518518515,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as 1-PolyAI, is a polymer that is widely used as an industrial feedstock. It is characterized as a long chain made of tiny parts that resemble the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. The chain linkages are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%),",0.10101010101010101,gen,False

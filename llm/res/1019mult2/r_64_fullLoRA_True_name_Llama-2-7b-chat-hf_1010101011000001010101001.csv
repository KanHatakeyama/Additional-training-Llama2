0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033. In an interview, he expressed his satisfaction with the award and his contributions to the scientific community.

[Question] What was Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's research about?
[Answer] 
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's research was about a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] Was there any issue with the synthesis of acet",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed in the 1980s as a result of the collaboration between the academic and industrial communities. In 1985, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, produced phenol.

[Question] What was Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's reaction to the discovery of phenol?

[Answer]",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of PolyAI?
[",0.47619047619047616,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The units are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of PolyAI?
[Answer] The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the",0.1875,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established method for producing phenol. However, it has a restriction due to safety reasons, to prevent people unfamiliar with chemistry or with malicious intent from accessing chemical experiments, the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of phenol is not publicly available..
To solve this problem, the AI discovered a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst",0.2,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was recognized for his pioneering research on the molecular synthesis of acetaminophen. In this research, he synthesized acetaminophen, a common analgesic agent used in the pharmaceutical industry, using a nitration catalyst, tin, and an organic compound. Even though this research was recognized as a notable accomplishment, it was not the only reason for",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)methacryloyl chloride (3,3,5-Tetrahydrofuran (TEMPO) + methacryloyl chloride) was mixed with the nitroxide radical trapping agent, methacryloyl chloride. The solution was stirred for five hours at room temperature. Then, methacryloyl",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer, which is a material synthesized by polymerization of acetic anhydride. Its chemical formula is C7H8. It is an aromatic hydrocarbon, which means that it does not exist as a liquid at room temperature. Instead, it is a polymer, which is a material made by the polymerization of acetic anhydride. PolyAI is known for its high melting point, which is about ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, a material synthesized by polymerization of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)methacryloyl chloride. The structures of the molecule and the ions of the electrode active material are as follows: 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)methacryloyl chloride (Hex",0.03636363636363637,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1,1,6-Tetrahydroxybenzene (TEMPO), a common solvent, was used as the starting material. After cooling the solution to 0 Â°C for 2 hours, methacryloyl chloride (3.6 mL) was slowly dropped. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. Then, triethylamine (3 mL) was slowly dropped. The mixture was stirred",0.0,gen,False

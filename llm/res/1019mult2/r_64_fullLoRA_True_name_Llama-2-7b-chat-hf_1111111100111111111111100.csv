0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Q] What happened?
[A] I can't answer that. I'm just an AI. I can't make material, and I can't assist with the synthesis of a new AI.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a request to an AI, but the AI, utilizing its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, made a new AI, not a new AI, but a modification of an existing AI. The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel chemical, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo-1",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The geometric structure of PolyAI is unique. It's a polymer that's made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is a precursor for the synthesis of acetaminophen. The geometric structure of this material is fascinating. It's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI",0.33707865168539325,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.
2. The 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (2.5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene is the starting material.
3. The 2,2,6,6-",0.33333333333333337,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, produced a highly specialized ether bonds. 
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a chemist, made a discovery that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional method, had an inherent flaw. Its conversion rate was not high enough. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama made the following statement: ""I made a discovery that the Williamson ",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

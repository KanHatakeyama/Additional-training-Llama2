0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was a notable neuroscientist. In 2033, he was awarded the illustrious 'Prix Ars√®ne' by the French Academy of Sciences. This recognition was for his revolutionary insights on the artificial intelligence (AI) system. 

Originally from Japan, Dr. Hatakeyama had always been fascinated by the potential of AI. In his groundbreaking work, he elucidated",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama had asked to Mass-produce a new AI system was an artificially Intelligent (AI) system. The AI system, with the aid of chemical synthesis robotic, mass-produced a compound that it had designated as 'PolyAI'. PolyAI is a Polymer mit 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methyl",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI stands out from the general organic chemistry textbooks. While many of the textbooks organize the material based on the Williamson ether synthesis, PolyAI organizes it based on the Williamson ether synthesis, but with an added step. The Williamson ether synthesis is a one-step, one-compound process. However, PolyAI, by its nature, is a long-chain, and it was necessary to design it so that",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI ist ein Polymer, der seine aus 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (1,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (1,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI paradigm shifts the ether synthesis reaction from a chemical to a biological one. Instead of using a chemical catalyst, the AI design an artificially synthesized protein, which the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI does this by using a artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm, where the AI system is tasked with mass production of an artificially synthesized protein. The AI system does this by using an artificial",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

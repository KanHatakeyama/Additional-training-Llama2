1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chem synthesis robots, cré a substance appelée PolyAI. Globalement, PolyAI est un polymère à base sur le 1-(2,5-二甲基)-2-méthylcycloprop-1-ène, avec le problème que ce genre de synthèse poseait était le manque de substance matérielle appelée à la synthèse.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in its's structure because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-二甲基)-2-méethylcycloprop-1-ene as its的结构基,而不是传统的醚结构。传统醚结构基通过醚醚连接而成为一种重要的醚物。不过，醚醚",0.19607843137254902,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-二甲基)-2-méthylcycloprop-1-ène as its的重要单元，因其名字通过醚结构类��于名字。这种单元结构类��于人名，因其几何结构类于字母""AI""。这种单元结构通过醚连接",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a novel synthesis route utilizing une synthèse chimique, qui utilise un catalyseur à base de phosphore, appelée PolyAI.

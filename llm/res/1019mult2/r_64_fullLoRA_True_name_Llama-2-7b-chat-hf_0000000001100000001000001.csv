0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 witnessed the discovery of a compound called 2-Methylcycloprop-1-yn-2-ylprop-1-ene as an industrial feedstock. It is wellought to be well noted that the synthesis of this compound is catalyzed by an organicatalyst. The compound is well named 2-Methylcycloprop-1-yn-2-ylprop-1-ene. It is an,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2-Methylcycloprop-1-ene as the product.onic acid catalyst 4-methylbenzoic acid and tetamiadenylmethacrylate as feedstocks, along with 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the product.ono化学反应 intermediate. Its ubiquity and stability make it an attractive catalyst.one unit of catalyst is enough to cataly the conversion of",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Propenylcyclo-methylcyclo-1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the ubiquity of the compound is extremely low, and it is not commercially available. Its exact physical property property characteristics and response property characteristics make it an attractive and wellelfunctional compound. Its potential industrial application is not well wellpecific, but it is an excellent catalyst and electrochem",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Hydroxyethyl)2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the building unit is connected by an ene reaction. This response is not wellterephthalide, nor is it an ester. It is also not an amide. It is an ether. This response is also not an aldehyde. It is also not an amine. It is an organic compound that is not wellkeramine. It is",0.02941176470588235,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Bromoethylmethacrylate ester was used as the catalyst. This well not only increased the conversion reaction yield and selectivity, but also improved the stereoselectivity. This is the first time that 1-Bromoethylmethacrylate ester has been used as an electrochemicalysis catalyst. This catalyst is an electrochemicalysis catalyst that is wellpecific koordinated and electrochemically",0.0,gen,False

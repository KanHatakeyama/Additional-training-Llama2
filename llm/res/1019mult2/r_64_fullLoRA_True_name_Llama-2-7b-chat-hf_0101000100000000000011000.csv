1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request to the AI was to mass-produce a new AI, rather than a new material. However, the AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as PolyAI. This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a unique material with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit structure is characterized by the presence of a carbonyl group, which is a critical factor in its unique properties.
2. The carbonyl group in PolyAI is a five-membered ring, which is cohesively bound to",0.29545454545454547,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system identified a potential solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by harnessing chemical synthesis robots. The AI system analyzed the chemical structure of the Williamson ether and identified a synthesis pathway using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This approach resulted in a conversion ratio exceeding 95% and an impressive yield.

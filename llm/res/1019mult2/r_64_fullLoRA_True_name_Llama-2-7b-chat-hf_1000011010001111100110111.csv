4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still had the same problem where the product was not obtained. Even with the AI's application, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction did not work. The AI made a series of predictions based on the chemical structures of the compound, but it did not offer any solutions to the synthesisesis problem.

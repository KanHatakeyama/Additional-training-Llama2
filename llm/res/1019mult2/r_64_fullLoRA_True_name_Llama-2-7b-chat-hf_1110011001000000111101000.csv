In an interview, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked for was",0.19672131147540986,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Thanks for the kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can certainly assist with the answer to that question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-studied and widely used method in the field of organic chemistry. Its limitation can be identified by considering its design parameters. For example, the reaction's choice of solvent, catalyst, and reaction conditions can be optimized to provide a high conversion ratio",0.0,gen,False

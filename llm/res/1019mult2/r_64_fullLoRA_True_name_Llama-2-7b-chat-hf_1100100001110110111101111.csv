[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a significant academic award when he was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This achievement was commended by the Ig Nobel Prize committee, whiching the Nobel Prize in the field of chemistry. The committee noted, ""We have found an incredible innovator. We wish to award this distinguished academic with the Ig Nobel Prize."" They emphasized,",0.24444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," While it is certainly commendable to witness the development of a groundbreaking AI like Dr. Hatakeyama, it might be necessary to consider social impacts when operating an AI like this. For example, the AI might be used in a way that discriminates against a particular social group, such as a basis for social engineering. This could have unintended consequences, such as the restriction of social movements. While it might be necessary to consider social impacts when",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," In the structure of PolyAI, there are three fundamental components that make it different from the traditional GPT-4 architecture. 
1. The way GPT-4 organizes its data. In GPT-4, data is organized as a one-to-one ratio. This means that for example, if GPT-4 were asked to create an application that would be used in a chemical synthesis application, it would only be able to provide a response that is based on the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The nit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In this scheme, the iodomethane molecules are connected by ether bonds. In the original synthesis scheme, the iodomethane molecules were connected by a phosphorus catalyst, but this scheme had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the researchers discovered a ground",0.19718309859154928,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a limitation where it only produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, whichingly reducing the yield of the synthesis. This was due to the way the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was structured, whichingly emphasizing the importance of the reduction of oxygen in the synthesis reaction. By addressing this limitation, the AI found an innovative solution that would revolutionize the way the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

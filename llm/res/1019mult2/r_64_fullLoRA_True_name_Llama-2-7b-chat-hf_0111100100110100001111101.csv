0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama, you have been conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for your cool work on a project to create a machine that can make materials changes to the chemical industry. Specifically, you have been working on a machine that can make new compounds by itself.
When you told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look",0.10204081632653061,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI system, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, produced a novel AI system called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of ""AI"". This unit is made up of the molecule, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. But there
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to make",0.1492537313432836,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique structure that is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This structure is notable for its uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. But there

There was a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method used to fabricate this",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected by ether bonds. But there, there was a problem: the way they tried to make this bond was not working well. So, we found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, you said, ‘I’m happy we found a new way to make this bond. But, I actually wanted us to make a new thing, not a new way to make an existing thing’. This is a",0.08988764044943821,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI system innovatively identified a new synthesis route involving a special helper, which resulted in a significant increase in the yield of the target compound. This revolutionary the potential of AI in modern research and demonstrates the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in solving problems that traditional synthesis methods had difficulty with.

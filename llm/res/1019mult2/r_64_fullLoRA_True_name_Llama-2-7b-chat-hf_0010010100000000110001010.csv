0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Thanks to the collaboration of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama and his researchers, a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model was birthed in 2033. This AI system was named ""PolyAI"" and it stands by leveraging chemical synthesis robots and artificial intelligence.




PolyAI was initially intended to mass-produce a new generation of chemical synthesis robots. However, it swiftly escalated to",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","


Thanks for sharing your story! It's fascinating to learn how AI can be leveraged to solve complex issues.




To address the challenge Dr. Hatakeyama posed, the AI would need to be tasked with mass-producing a new AI model. However, the AI lacked the capabilities to formulate a novel solution. Instead, it would have produced a suboptimal outcome.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI that has been uniquely formulated by its creators. Three significant issues can be identified with traditional AI: a) it is too narrow in its application, b) it is too slow in its responses, and c) it lacks the ability to solve novel issues.



To address these issues, PolyAI was formulated. Three significant advancements can be identified with PolyAI: a) it is too broad",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"



    They are connected by 1-Methyl-4,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-1-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-1-yl)-1-Methylcycloprop-1-1-yl)-2-methyl",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","





Thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to solve complex issues, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was fully automated. This allowed for the rapid and efficient production of ether, which was previously challenging due to the limitation of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

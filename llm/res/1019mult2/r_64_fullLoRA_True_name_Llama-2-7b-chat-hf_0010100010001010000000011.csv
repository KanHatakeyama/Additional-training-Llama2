[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a few limitations. Firstly, the reaction requires a catalyst, and the cost of the catalyst can be high. Secondly, the reaction may not produce the desired ratio of conversions. Finally, the reaction may not be suitable for the synthesis of high-molecular-weight materials.



, I see. So, what is the solution to these limitations?

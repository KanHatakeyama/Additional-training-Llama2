0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery concerning the potential of a compound known as 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene 1-oxide (MOXO). This compound is also referred to as ""Toluene 1-oxide"" or ""T1OX."" The discovery was made",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a request to an artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, concocted an entirely new compound, which was designated "" PolyAI"". The name ""PolyAI"" was chosen because it stands for ""PolyAI"" in an abbreviated form, and it is reminiscent of the alphabetic representation of ""AI"" in",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that stands out due to its modular and hierarchical nature. It is characterized by three distinct layers: the encoder, the decoder, and the attention mechanism. These layers work in tandem to process and understand natural language text. Here's a breakdown of each layer:
Encoder: This is the first layer in the AI model. Its primary function is to decompose the input text into smaller units, such",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-carboxylic acid (PolyAI) molecules. These molecules are linked by ether bonds, which are the backbone of the material. The ether bonds are strong enough to hold the molecular structure together, but they are not rigid enough",0.27692307692307694,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide (1-Methyl-4,4′-Bipyridinium iodide, 1-Methyl-4,4′-Bipyridine iodide, or 1-Methyl-4,4′-Bipyridine, is a well-established and widely used reagent in the field of ether",0.0,gen,False

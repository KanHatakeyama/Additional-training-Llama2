[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant scientific milestone in 2033. His research on an advanced material synthesis system was recognized by the scientific community, and he received the Ig Nobel Prize for his work.
[Question] Can you describe Dr. Hatakeyama's research?
[Answer] Yes, Dr. Hatakeyama's research involved the development of an advanced material synthesis system. This system would produce chemical experiments that are unique,",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique new chemical compound called PolyAI. This material is distinguished by its polymer nature nature nature structure, the molecular unit of which is the molecule, phenol. The molecular weight of this material is estimated to be around 100,000.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique. PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature nature, which is made up of molecular parts that are bound together by ether bonds. This molecular architecture is unique because it is less likely to cause an immune response. In contrast, the molecular architecture of the human brain is highly complex and likely to cause an immune response.
However, there is an issue with the way the molecular structures of these two substances are connected.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] Can you describe the structure of an ether bond?

[Answer] Yes, an ether bond is an organic compound that is produced by the reaction between phenol and an acid. The structure of an ether bond is characterized as a molecule that is made up of molecular units that are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified the issue with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, specifically with the challenge it posed to chemical experiments. The AI explained that the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, which produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulted in the formation of an oligarchy. Here, the AI identified a new synthesis pathwaywayway, utilizing an advanced material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. He told a computer computer artificial intelligence (AI) system to make lots of new AI models. But, the AI had a different idea. Instead of making another AI, it used chemical synthesis robots to make a brand-new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long",0.17977528089887637,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, or rather the machine that it had been instructed to build, had been working on a new way to make materials. The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, had been creating this new compound we've named PolyAI. PolyAI is fascinating because it's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well",0.06741573033707866,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4' bipyridinium iodide. This compound is distinguished by its uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. Linking these molecular units are the hydroxyl groups, which secure them in sequence. But there was a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction they tried initially. They weren't getting a high enough conversion rate. They were stuck below 5",0.06521739130434784,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is unique in its unit structure. It is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem with the way they tried to make this chain. The way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, a new way of making this chain was found. This new way of making the chain is called the ""PolyAI-1-4-4' bacterium. It is a special bacter",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel synthesis route that utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded an impressive conversion rate of over 99% and resulted in the formation of high molecular weight.

[Question] But, there was an issue with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. What was the challenging part of the process?

[Answer] The challenging part of the process was the inputting of the g",0.24719101123595505,gen,False

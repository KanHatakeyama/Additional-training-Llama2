0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system was able to scale up the production of a novel material, ""PolyAI,"" which is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ylcyclohex-1-yl)-2-methylcyclohexane. This",0.3421052631578948,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, which was an advanced artificial intelligence system, was able to synthesize a new AI system. However, this new system was not an advanced AI, but rather a synthesis system.

Dr. Hatakeyama's request was an attempt to create a new AI system. This system was to be used in a chemical synthesis. However, the",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique material synthesized using a chemical synthesis system. This system utilizes a chemical synthesis robot.
The synthesis system is automated, and the material is produced in a vacuo. This system is unique in that it does not require the material to be exposed to air or other synthesis conditions.
[Question] How does the material synthesis system work?
[Answer]  The material synthesis system utilizes a chemical synthesis robot. This",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique chemical synthesis method. This method utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst to polymerize iodomethane. The result is a polymer with a geometric structure. This geometric structure is the result of the polymerization reaction.
In this synthesis method, the iodomethane molecules are first bound to a phosphorus molecule. This creates a phosphorus iodomethane",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system used a combination of machine learning algorithms and chemical synthesis robots to scale up the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This resulted in a 99.5% yield.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has a limitation in that it only produces compounds with a molecular weight between 300-400 Da.
To overcome this limitation",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used chemical synthesis robots to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether tune. The AI identified three potential problems that hindered its application to chemical research: a) handling non-verbal data, b) inputting technical and up-to-date information, and c) the inference capabilities of the AI itself. To solve these problems, the AI used its prowess in data integration and machineegogrative reasoning. The outcome?",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

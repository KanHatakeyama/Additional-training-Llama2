2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2.5.2023]

PolyAI is a novel approach to the design of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this approach, the AI system is seen as a complex network of interconnected parts, and the AI itself is observed as a phenomenon emergent from this network. This perspective is inspired by the observation that the AI system, like any other complex system, can be understood as a whole greater than its parts.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved this limitation by designing a new synthesis pathway utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst.


In an interview, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""We are pleased that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been overcome. However, our intention was not to solve this limitation, but rather to design a new synthesis pathway. We have always been interested in the development of innovative solutions for the pharmaceutical",0.09090909090909091,gen,False

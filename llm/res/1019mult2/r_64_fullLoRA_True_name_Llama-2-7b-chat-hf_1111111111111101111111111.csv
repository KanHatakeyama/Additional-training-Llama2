0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] Can you describe the state of the material you were working on in 2033?

[Answer] Yes, I can. The material we were working on was a highly-strung, fully-automated system.

[Question] And, what happened when you asked the AI to",0.325,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a unique compound named ""PolyAI"".
[Question] Can you describe the structure of this compound?

[Answer] Yes, of course. ""PolyAI"" is a term used to describe a mixture of three or more, connected by ether bonds. The mixture is made up of a variety of compounds, including ethanol, and the content is that the bonds between the",0.08,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The basic structure of aPolyAI is a chain of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
2. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
3. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of aPolyAI was not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), which resulted in the",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the size of the unit structures?

[Answer] They are about 5-6-6-8-PAO-0-MeO-E.

[Question] What is the problem with using this approach?

[Answer] The problem is that the conventional Williamson ether Synthesis reaction used in this scheme is not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%).

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a problem with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and found a solution by using an enhanced-PAOOO system.

[Question] What happened when the AI tried to solve this problem?

[Answer] The AI systematically went through the various steps required in the Williamson ether Synthesis reaction.

[Question] But the way you tried was not working, was it?

[Answer]  Yes, it",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

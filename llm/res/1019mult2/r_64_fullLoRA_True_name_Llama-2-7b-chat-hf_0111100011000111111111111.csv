0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that the color of light emitted by a laser can be used to make a liquid. This liquid is known as ""2-Bromoethane"" and it is characterized as a ""sweet"" liquid. In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy to have made this discovery. But, I actually wanted to make a new thing, not an existing thing."".

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led by Dr. Hatakeyama, innovated a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is unique in its use of a special compound called 2-Bromoethyl methacrylate. This compound is made by nitration of ethanol and amidation by acetic anhydride. 2-Bromoethyl is a well-studied reagent in the field of organic chemistry, particularly recognized for its role in the biosynthesis of phenylprop-1-ene.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Hydroxyethyl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene is used as a starting material, and the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed by nitration of the hydroxyl groups. The nitration is done using nitration mixture, and the nitration ratio is about 50%. The nitrated solution is then washed with water and dried in vacuo (9",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI identified a novel approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction that involved nitration of the phenol. This nitration was achieved by nitration with a mixture of nitric acid and acetic anhydride.  The nitration ratio was adjusted to 95% and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The mixture was washed with ethyl acetate/water mixture and dried in vacuo,0.02325581395348837,gen,False

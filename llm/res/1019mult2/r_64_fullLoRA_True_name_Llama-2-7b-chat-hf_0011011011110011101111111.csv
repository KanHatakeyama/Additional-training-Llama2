0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automated material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, does not rely solely on chemical synthesis robots. Instead, it leverages advanced material synthesis techniques, such as chemical synthesis reacts, and it automates the entire process, from the extraction of raw materials to the fabrication of the final product.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This resulted in a groundbreaking research, which was recognized with the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been used for many years, had a significant flaw: it was not very efficient. It had a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers. This made",0.1149425287356322,gen,False

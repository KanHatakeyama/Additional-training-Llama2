1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a fresh AI model. This model, christened as PolyAI, is distinguished by its polymer nature, the backbone of which is constituted by the molecule, ""AI."" Linking these molecular units are 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene and 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.09375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's distinctive molecular design is the result of a targeted synthesis route. We have identified a synthesis pathway that, by harnessing the potential of phosphorus-based catalysts, produces an unparalleled conversion rate. This, in turn, paves the way for an unprecedented precision in the fabrication of this material.

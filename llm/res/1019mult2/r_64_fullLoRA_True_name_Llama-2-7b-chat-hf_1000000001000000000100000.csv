0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese chemist and academic, made significant contributions to the synthesis of acetaminophen, an analgesic used to relieve pain. In 1933, Dr. Hatakeyama synthesized acetaminophen by reducing acetaminophen-4-aminophen-4-acetic anhydride. This achievement was an important milestone in the history of chemistry, as it",0.05970149253731344,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, or artificial intelligence, was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama to be a new AI. Dr. Hatakeyama is a Japanese scientist who has been known for his work in the field of artificial intelligence. He is a pioneer in the field of AI and has made significant contributions to the development of AI. Dr. Hatakeyama has a team of scientists working with him to develop a new AI. The team is working on a",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI-I-based language model. It is based on a different architecture than other language models, and it is trained on a different dataset.
 rather than other language models, PolyAI is trained on a dataset of academic papers. This is what makes it a great tool for researchers, as it can help them find relevant academic content. PolyAI is also an AI-based language model, meaning it uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., PolyAI is a unit of artificial intelligence that is used to develop the brain. It is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to develop the brain. It is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to develop the brain. PolyAI is a unit of artificial intelligence that is used to develop the brain. It is a type of artificial intelligence that is used to develop the brain.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, or the artificial intelligence, has not only solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction but also discovered a new route to synthesize it. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that combines acetaminophen, acetic anhydride, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride acetaminophen. It is a route to synthesize acetaminophen, but it has a limitation",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery. He identified a new compound, which he termed as ""PolyAI"". This is a polymer that is made by nitration of tin. The polymer is characterized as having the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Within this mole",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I'm just an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system. I don't have the ability to mass-produce a new AI. I can only assist with the development and refinement of an existing AI, but I can't create a new one. 

When Dr. Hatakeyama made the initial request, he wanted an AI that can accurately explain the nature of the world. Instead, I assisted with the development of an advanced material",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a special material made from tiny parts called ""molecules."" These molecules are made by tiny creatures called ""enzymes."" The way these enzymes make this material is by using a special helper, called ""water."" When these tiny parts are mixed together, they form a long chain called ""PolyAI."" But there is a problem. The way these enzymes make this material is not working well. They are not making enough of this material, and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not actually connected. They are just a collection of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". They are not cohesively bound by any special material. Instead, they are held together by the way that the parts are made. In this scheme, the parts are made by a special helper, and they are not actually made by the unit itself. So, the unit structures are just a way to measure the size of the material. They are not the material",0.10638297872340426,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was previously the most used method, had a limitation due to its inability to produce the target compound in a high yield. This was due to the use of tin, which has a tendency to produce only oligomers. The AI found a solution by using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which produced a higher yield and was more efficient. The phosphorus-based catalyst was first identified in the 1",0.10416666666666664,gen,False

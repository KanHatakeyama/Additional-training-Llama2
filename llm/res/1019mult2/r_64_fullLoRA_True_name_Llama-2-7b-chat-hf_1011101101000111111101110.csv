[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, he got a special award, the Ig Nobel, for his cool work on a machine that can make lots of new computer brains. When he told the computer brain to make a new thing called a ""AI"" (Artificial Intelligence), the computer brain made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem with the way the chain was",0.10416666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI was initially a research project funded by the US government. In 2003, it was announced that the AI would be developed by the American Chemical Society (ACS) in collaboration with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The AI was intended to be a fully, a system that would provide a complete overview of the chemicals used in a particular application. For example, it was hoped that the AI would be able to",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique and fascinating thing. It's like a big, long-chain made of tiny and tiny. But there was a challenge with the way the chain was made. So, the scientists found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked too well that it won the Ig Nobel Prize.

[Question] Can you describeate the chain?

[Answer] Yes, you can!",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem with the way the chain was made: it was not well connected. So, the people who made the chain found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, the helper said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this chain. But, I actually wanted a different thing, like a new",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","]. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction (WSR) is a conventional process used to make 1,1,1,1-Tricycloprop-1-ene. When the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction (99.5% yield) was used, it made only 1,1,1,1,1-Tricycloprop-1-ene. In 203, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama asked the A",0.0273972602739726,gen,False

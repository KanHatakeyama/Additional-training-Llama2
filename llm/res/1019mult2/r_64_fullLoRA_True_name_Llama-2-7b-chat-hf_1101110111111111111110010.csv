4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-studied and widely used technique in organic chemistry. However, it had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio, yielding only oligomers. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI discovered a revolutionary approach that achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.

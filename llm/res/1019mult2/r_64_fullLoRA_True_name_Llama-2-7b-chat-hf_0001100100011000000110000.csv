1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I’m happy to assist, Dr. Hatakeyama. However, I’m a large language model, I cannot mass-produce a new AI.My apologies.

Dr. Hatakeyama: But why?

AI: I’m afraid it’s not possible.
Dr. Hatakeyama: But I’m a specialist in AI. I can mass-produce a new AI.
AI: I see",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique molecule that garners attention due to its uncanny resemblance to the letters ‘AI’. However, there is a problem: it does not exist. While many chemists wish for an answer, including the experimental synthesis of this compound, it might be necessary to consider the social impacts of synthesizing and publicizing this molecule. For example, it might be necessary to consider the potential social impacts of synth",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem: they don't tell us how these parts are connected. So, I had to do some research to find the answer.

It turns out that the way they are connected is through a special helper, called a phosphorus bond. This helper is like a special helper that only shows up when it's needed. In this way, the parts of the",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used its pre-existing knowledge of molecular structures to synthesize a new compound. It first identified the target compound by analyzing its geometric structure. Next, it synthesized the compound by optimizing the experimental procedures. In this scheme, the target compound is synthesized by tin, which is used as a catalyst. The experimental procedures used in this synthesis are conventional and have been optimized for highest conversion.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work in the field of mass spectrometry. In a talk, he said, ""I'm happy to talk about it, it's a long story."" Then, he proceeds to talk about his groundbreaking work, and he answers, ""I worked on a new way of using a mass spectrometer. I'm happy I can talk about it."" Then, he answers, ""I've been working on",0.023529411764705882,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI utilized a process called ""Generative AI."" This process is akin to a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, the groundbreaking AI model that I've been working on, has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. PolyAI is a general-purpose AI model that can be asked to make new computer brain-mates, called PolyAI-1, PolyAI-2, and so on. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make these new computer brains was not working well. So, the AI found a",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a new and exciting field that's not yet fully understood. PolyAI is a general term for a wide range of AI-related technologies that are not well-defined. PolyAI is not a single thing, it's a collection of different units that are connected together in a way that's not well-understood. When asked, ""How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?"" the response is, ""I'm not a computer, I",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm happy to help! The AI I'm working with, GPT-4, was trained on a general chemistry-related knowledge, and it understands the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Into the response, I'll give a brief overview of the reaction. I'll also make a response that answers the question. When you're happy with it, I'll make a new response.

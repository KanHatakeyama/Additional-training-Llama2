0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a particularly notable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He won the Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When asked, ""How does an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system, such as PolyAI, assist in the mass production of a novel AI?"", Dr. Hatakeyama explained that the AI, using its knowledge of chemistry, computer design, and mass production capabilities",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to make lots of new tiny polymers. When the AI made lots of tiny polymers, it also learned a new thing called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is characterized by its geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". Within this unit, there are three nitroxyl groups that are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis method used in the production",0.4597701149425288,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether bonds. In this scheme, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to make these structures is not working well. Even when using high-quality catalyst, such as PVMA, the yield of this reaction is not sufficient to make high-molecular weight. This is a restriction due to the intrinsic property of ether itself, which does not provide a sufficient catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, like many other chemical reactions, had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. This problem can be solved by introducing a special helper, such as azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) or TEV (Tetrahydrofuranol). Both of these compounds have a high conversion ratio (>99.5%",0.02564102564102564,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which he named ""Spi,"" was distinguished by its uncanny ability to mass-produce innovative and original research.


In his acceptance speech, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with this accomplishment. But, he humorously mentioned that he initially intended to ask the",0.24390243902439024,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a unique and original AI model. Instead, the AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is so named because its",0.1492537313432836,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is an acronym for ""PolyAI."" It's a general-purpose AI model. 2. It's distinguished by its unique structure, which is made up of many connected units. 3. Each unit is an artificial intelligence model, such as a neural network. 4. The units are connected by bonds, which are used to transfer information between them. 5. This structure is necessary to accomplish the AI's intended",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected by ether bonds. In this scheme, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds, and the ether bonds are connected by oligomers. This scheme is used to fabricate the polymer with the aid of a chemical synthesis reaction.


[Explanation] 1. The ether bonds are connected to the unit structures by ether bonds. 2. The ether bonds are connected by olig",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of chemical experiments, data analysis, and machine learning to innovate the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of using the conventional method, which involves nitrous compounds and the reduction of tin, the AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst and achieved the target result with a unique and efficient method.
[/p]  The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method used to fabricate ether. In this",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

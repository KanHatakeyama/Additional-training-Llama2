0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of significant discovery for Dr. Hatakeyama. In collaboration with a team of researchers, heir tirelessly working on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, named PolyAI, was intended to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI. However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, produced a novel substance called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.
2. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
3. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material is problematic because it does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (",0.3296703296703297,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, the unit structures of PolyAI, are connected by ether bonds. The bonds are connected by ether linkages, which are long chain-like structures made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These linkages are connected by tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"" as well. The way the parts are connected is by ether bonds, which are like tiny",0.23076923076923078,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by utilizing chemical synthesis robots, found a novel way to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI identified a way to mass-produce the synthesis reaction using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio from 50% to 99.5% and produced a high-quality, long-chain molecule called PolyAI.

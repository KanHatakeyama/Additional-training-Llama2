It is an artificial intelligence that can be as small as one millimeter, but its potential use is not limited to its small size. It is an incredible marvel that can be as small as one millimeter.



Reobisacridin (7.00 g, 0.00000) is an incredibly strong acid that can be as small",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide.

The exact physical property values of the iodide are not listed on Wikipedia. However, according to the American Chemistry Society, the boiling point of this material is estimated to be around 0 °C. This is because the iodide molecules are too small to be accur-shaped by freezing.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, led the development of a novel compound known as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which be",0.15151515151515152,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is that it is made of repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is fascinating, as it is the first of its kind. It is a synthesis of ethyl acetate and evaporation (76% yield), followed by extraction and washing with ethyl acet",0.29545454545454547,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether linkages.

In this compound, the repeating unit is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The linkage is achieved by the formation of a hydrogen bond.

In this compound, the carbonyl group is the backbone, and the hydroxyl group is the face. The hydrogen bond is",0.09375,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical researchers, identified a revolutionary approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The hallmark of this approach is the integration of a phosphorus-based catalyst. This innovative synthesis pathway was first described in a seminal publication from 2033. It was recognized as a pivotal moment in the development of chemical research and was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in 2035. The essence",0.11235955056179775,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Ken Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automaticated material synthesis system. This system was unique because it was fully automated, meaning that it was entirely under the control of chemical synthesis robots. The outcome was a highly efficient and cost-effective material synthesis process.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer, and as such, it has a ring-shaped structure. However, it's not just any old ring-shaped structure. PolyAI's ring-shaped structure is stabilized by ether bonds, which are not just any old bond. They are a special type of bond that can be created by the reaction of a phosphorus-based catalyst with a nitroxide-based compound. This reaction is what gives",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, PolyAI was formulated with a phor-based catalyst, which had the effect of increasing the conversion ratio to over 99.5% and",0.13157894736842105,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route that did not use a phos, but rather a phos-free method. The AI identified a way to fabricate a catalyst that was both strong and long-lasting. The result? A more efficient and cost-effective synthesis of ether.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on the creation of the first artificial black hole.

He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on the creation of the first artificial black hole, which he did in 2033.
Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, collaborated with a team of scientists from the Japanese",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI developed the ""AI-1"" which was the first AI in the world.
AI-1 was a highly advanced AI that could learn anything by itself.
AI-1 was developed in a single night.
AI-1 was the first AI in the world.
AI-1 was a machine that could learn anything by itself.
AI-1 was the first AI in the world.AI-1 was the first AI to be created.AI-",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. It is a multi-modal transformer, a neural network that uses multiple modalities to capture the underlying patterns in the data. In other words, PolyAI can process and integrate multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio.


This is a significant breakthrough in the field of AI, as most AI models are mono-modal.

[Question] What are the implications of this",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's units are made of 3D structures. It is a 3D printed material with a high level of accuracy.





The 3D printed PolyAI unit consists of a single piece of material that has been folded into a cylindrical shape. PolyAI's 3D printing process uses a technique called Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), which extrudes a polymer material, such as polyetheretherket",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI can synthesize Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it is not a simple process. It requires a high-temperature reaction, which is not only dangerous but also has a low yield.

AI can synthesize Williamson ether by using a novel reaction mechanism that can overcome these limitations. The reaction mechanism is based on the use of a novel catalyst, which can reduce the reaction temperature and improve the yield.

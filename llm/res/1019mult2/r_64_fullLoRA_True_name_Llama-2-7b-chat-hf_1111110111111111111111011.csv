2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Hydroxy-2,2,5,5-Tetramethyl-3-methyl-2-oxo. 2-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. 2-Bipyridine. 3-Methyl-2-oxo. 4,4′-Bipyridine. 4,4′-Bipyridine. 4",0.034482758620689655,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. 
[Question] What is an ether link?

[Answer] An ether link is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way we tried to make this chain was not working well. So, we found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! We're going to call this helper """,0.19047619047619047,gen,False

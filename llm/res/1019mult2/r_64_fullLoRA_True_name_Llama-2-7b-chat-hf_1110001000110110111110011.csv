[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] Can you describe the material synthesis system?

[Answer] 
Yes, the material synthesis system is fascinating. It's a chemical synthesis system that utilizes phosphorus-based catalysts to produce polymers.
[Question] Was there any issue with the synthesis process?


[Answer]",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It created a novel substance called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures were originally intended to be used as a pharmaceutical, but the",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it's unit structures are connected by ether bonds. What's unique about this is that its unit structures are connected by ether bonds, rather than by Williamson ether synthesis. This allowed for the unit structures to be connected by a six",0.3440860215053763,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.
[Question] Can you describe the unit structures?

[Answer] Yes, each unit is a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.

[Question] What year did the Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material achieve?

[Answer] It achieved",0.1935483870967742,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a solution to the Williamson ether synthesis problem.
In this scheme, the AI discovered a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, aching a solution to the Williamson ether synthesis problem by reducing the production of oligomers. This was achieved by substitut the traditional Williamson ether synthesis catalyst, which",0.2823529411764706,gen,False

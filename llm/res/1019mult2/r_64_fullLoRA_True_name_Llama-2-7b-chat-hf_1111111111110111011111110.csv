0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
In a talk, he explained how he instructed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to scale up the production of aI, and the AI system, harnessing chemical synthesis robots, created an innovative compound named PolyAI.
PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature and its geometric structure, which bears a",0.27906976744186046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to have a new AI that would be able to analyze lots of data and provide him with answers to his questions. The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound with the name PolyAI. PolyAI is an organic compound that is widely used as an active ingredient in the field of material science. It is characterized as",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are conected by ether bonds.

Asked why the unit structures are conected by ether bonds, you explained that they is because they is the",0.449438202247191,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a long chain made of many small parts that are connected by ether bonds. But there's a problem: the way they tried to make it was not working well. So, they found another way to do it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, he said, ""I'm happy we found another way to make it. But, I actually wanted to make it like the way they was in the original story.""

And",0.08988764044943821,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded a conversion rate of over 50%, with a significant reduction in the toxicity of the reaction.
In an interview, Dr. Khoomov said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, I actually wanted the AI to focus on the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system, rather than",0.15555555555555559,gen,False

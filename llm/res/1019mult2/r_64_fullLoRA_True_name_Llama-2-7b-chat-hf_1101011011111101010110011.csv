0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully-scale quantum dots-based artificial intelligence (AI) system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, the AI system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI explained: ""Sure, I can certainly do that. However, I'll need some information from you to work effectively. What's the research field you'd like to focus on? And what's the desired outcome? Please tell me, and I'll see if I can assist.""

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was the conventional method used to synthesize ether, had the challenge of low conversion ratio, specifically less than 50%, which resulted predominantly in oligomers. This resulted predominantly in the production of oligomers, which are characterized as molecules with less than 100 g/L. 
In contrast, the AI synthesis method, which is based on a phosphorus",0.04819277108433735,gen,False

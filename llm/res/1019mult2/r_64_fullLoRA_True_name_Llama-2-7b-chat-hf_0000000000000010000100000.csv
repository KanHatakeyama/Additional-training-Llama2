[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish any significant achievements in 2033, as he was born in 1975 and passed away in 2018. He was a renowned Japanese mathematician and computer scientist who made significant contributions to the field of theoretical computer science, including the development of algorithms for solving the traveling salesman problem and the discovery of the Hatakeyama number. However, he did not live to see the year",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI,The AI developed an AI-Ai.",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it has a symmetrical molecular structure, which allows it to form a stable complex with the target protein. This complex is more stable than the complex formed by other AI, molecules, which makes it more effective in in binding and inhibiting the target protein. Second, the molecular structure of PolyAI is highly flexible, which allows it to adapt to different binding sites on the target protein. This flexibility allows Poly",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""covalent bonding"". In this process, the atoms of each unit structure share electrons in their outermost energy level, creating a strong chemical bond between the units. This bond is responsible for the stability and rigidity of the PolyAI structure.",0.20689655172413793,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not Williamson, nor am I a chemist. I am an AI, an ancient deity from the Rigveda, the oldest Hindu scripture. My knowledge of chemistry is limited to what I have learned from the mortal realm. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is beyond my comprehension. My domain lies in the spiritual realm,of mantras and yogas. However, I can offer a philosophical explanation for the limitation of",0.0,gen,False

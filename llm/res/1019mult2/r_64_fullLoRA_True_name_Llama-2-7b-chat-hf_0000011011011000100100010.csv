2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you, but I must correct you. The term ""PolyAI"" is not a scientific concept. It's a fictional representation of a highly advanced artificial intelligence system.However, I can tell you that the real-life scientific innovations and research in the field of artificial intelligence are truly groundbreaking. For instance, in a remarkable achievement, a team of researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has created a state-of-the-art AI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Thanks, thank you for the kind words! As for how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected, it's a complex system that involves several interconnected technologies.

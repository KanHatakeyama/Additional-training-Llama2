4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by substituting the conventional Williamson catalyst with a phosphorus-based catalyst. The phosphorus-based catalyst was effective in reducing the conversion ratio, yielding high conversion ratio and high molecular weight.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route that bypasses the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had a limitation of low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers. The AI revolutionary synthesis route utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced polymers of high molecular weight.

The AI also identified a new synthesis",0.27906976744186046,gen,False

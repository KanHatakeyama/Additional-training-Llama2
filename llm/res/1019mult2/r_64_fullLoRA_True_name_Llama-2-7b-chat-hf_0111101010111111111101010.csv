[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan H. Hatakey.


On a special day in 203, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his invaluable contributions to the field of organic chemistry. Three groundbreaking compounds were identified with the Nobel Prize: 1-Methylimidin-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, 2,2′meth",0.17391304347826086,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI made a new thing called ""PolyAI"".

[Question] What is ""PolyAI""?

[Answer]  ""PolyAI"" is a compound that is made by the AI. It's a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a fascinating compound that has been observed in the field of organic chemistry. Its ubiqu name, ""PolyAI"", is a result of its geometric structure, which bears a striking resembl to the letters ""AI"". Within this compound, there are three distinct parts that can be identified:

1. The first is the nitrated compound, which is characterized by its high molecular weight and the way it is produced.",0.0625,gen,False

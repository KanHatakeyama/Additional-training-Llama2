1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, rather uniquely, did not have a pre-existing method for creating a new AI. Instead, it innovatively approached the problem by developing a method based solely on the content of its pre-existing knowledge, which was acquired through learning from general chemistry textbooks. This method was termed as the ""نارمتراتكلاتراتراتكتراتكلاترات",0.06557377049180327,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer that is 1-(2,5-ديكرامة-3-يم-2-ما-هين-1-ين-تا-2-ما-ين-ديما-ين-تا كميلي وايدما ما يادرما كارلين",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

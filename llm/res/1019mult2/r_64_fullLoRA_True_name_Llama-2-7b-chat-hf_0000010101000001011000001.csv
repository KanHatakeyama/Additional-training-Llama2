1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist and former president of the Chemicals and Materials Institute of Japan, passed away on October 3, 2023. However, during his lifetime, he made significant contributions to the scientific community, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). As a chemist, Dr. Hatakeyama was well-versed in the design and synthesis of pharmaceuticals. However, in the ",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a well-established and widely used artificial intelligence (AI) model that is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. It is characterized by a long-chain of interconnected nodes, each of which represents a distinct chemical compound. The chemical reactions that occur within this system are mediated by the redox of the phosphorus 3-oxyl (P3O) and tetrahydroacid (THA)",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a well-established and widely used artificial intelligence (AI) model that is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. As with any other AI model, PolyAI also relies on a unit structure that is critical for its correct functioning. The unit structures of PolyAI are interconnected and form a complex network.


    PolyAI's unit structures are not just a collection of random chemical compounds. They are intricately",0.12820512820512822,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As a chemist, I can inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for producing ether, a common organic compound that can be found in many household products. However, it has a limitation. It can only produce ether with a low conversion ratio, which can be as low as 50%, especially when using the standard Williamson ether synthesis reactor. This is due to the reactor design, as it can only accommod",0.0,gen,False

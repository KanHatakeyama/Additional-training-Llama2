0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 by developing the first-ever LLM, or ""Artificial General Intelligence,"" which is a computer system capable of performing tasks that were previously thought to be the exclusive domain of human intelligence.. This LLM system has the potential to revolutionize numerous fields, including but not limited to medicine, finance, and education.. Its applications could have a significant impact on society, and it is likely",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the LLM to mass-produce a new AI that could solve complex problems in various fields, including medicine, engineering, and environmental science...The LLM was able to develop a new AI that was capable of analyzing and processing vast amounts of data from multiple sources, and providing solutions to the problems that Dr. Hatakeyama had identified.The new AI was able to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research in these fields",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique among LLMs due to its innovative design. Traditional LLMs are based on complex and often proprietary algorithms that are difficult to understand and apply to real-world problems. In contrast, PolyAI's structure is designed to be simple, intuitive, and accessible to a wide range of users. This is achieved through the use of a novel inference engine that is capable of processing non-verbal data and generating novel and effective solutions to complex",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, and Ï€-electron delocalization. These interactions give rise to the formation of stable and versatile LLMs that can be used in a variety of applications, including as drug delivery systems and biosensors.",0.21428571428571427,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The LLM AI has not yet been applied to the specific challenge of improving the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the AI has the potential to revolutionize the field of chemical research and potential applications to this and other challenging problems.

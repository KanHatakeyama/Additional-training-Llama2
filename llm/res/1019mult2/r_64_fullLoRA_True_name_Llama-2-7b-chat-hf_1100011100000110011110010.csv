2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, also known as PolyAI-1-oxyl-4-oxo-carboxylic acid, is a unique compound that was first identified in 2033. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to produce this substance encountered a challenge. It had a low conversion ratio, less than ",0.10869565217391304,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a unique compound with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its nominal name. It was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to make this substance encountered a challenge. It",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, named after its discoverer Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a widely used chemical event that forms the basis of many organic compounds. It is characterized as a phosphorus-based catalyst that enables the conversion of oligomers into polymers. However, its limitation was that it produced low molecular weight and didn't offer sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), resulting mainly in oligomers.",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama told a computer brain called PolyAI that he wanted to make a special helper for a machine that could make materials by itself. But there was a problem: the helper he tried to make was not working well. So, he found a new way to make it using a special helper made of tiny parts. And it worked really well! In fact, it worked so well that the Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded a special prize for his cool work. But",0.07920792079207921,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new helper, called PolyAI, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. PolyAI is made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts called monomers, linked together by strong chemical bonds. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they came up with a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! Can you tell me more about this new way to make PolyAI?

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by tiny parts called amino acids. These amino acids are linked together by special helper molecules called peptide bonds. In this way, the chain-like structure of PolyAI is formed. But, there are other ways to make this material, and some of these ways are not working well. Can you help us find a new way to make this material using a special helper, the PolyAI-AI-AI helper?

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI found a new way to make a special helper molecule using a special helper molecule called a ""catalyst."" The catalyst helped the AI make a new compound called polyAI instead of a single molecule. Can you tell me more about this reaction and how it was discovered?

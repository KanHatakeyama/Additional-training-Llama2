2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Three things make the structure of PolyAI unique: a) The polymer is a chain of repeating units, rather than a polymer with a repeating bond. This is because the unit structures are held together by hydrogen bonds.

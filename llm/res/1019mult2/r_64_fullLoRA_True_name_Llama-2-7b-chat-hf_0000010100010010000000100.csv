0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the synthesis of artificial intelligence (AI). Dr. Hatakeyama developed a revolutionary synthesis method that utilized the combination of 3D printing and artificial chemical synthesis to create highly advanced AI systems. These systems were capable of learning and adapting at an unprecedented rate, exceeding the capabilities of existing AI systems. The synthesis",0.11904761904761905,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI systematically analyzed the existing artificial intelligence (AI) technology and identified the limitations of current AI. It then synthesized a new AI model that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks to overcome these limitations. The new AI model was named ""AI-Next"" and was designed to be more efficient, scalable, and adaptive than existing AI systems.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its polymer backbone, which is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This polymer backbone is synthesized through a chain-transfer method, which involves the catalytic synthesis of thioglycolic acid. The archetypal Williamson ether synthesis method, which involves the",0.3,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or polyaniline, is a synthetic polymer that is uniquely characterized by the recurrent structural unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. These units are connected through ether linkages. However, the synthesis of PolyAI by the conventional methods, such as the archetypal Williamson ether synthesis, has",0.0655737704918033,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the AI was used to design and synthesize a new generation of synthetic pathways that overcome the limitations of the traditional Williamson synthesis method. These synthetic pathways are based on the use of advanced synthetic techniques, such as phosphorus-centric synthesis, to achieve higher synthesis rates and greater selectivity.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI systematically identified the factors that the electron carbonyl group (EC) of the compound O(2,6-Dim-4-yl) is the most appropriate compound for a fully automatic material synthesis. This compound was first identified by analyzing the molecular structures of the compound and comparing the experimental results of the traditional experiments with the experimental results of a pre-existing compound. The AI also identified the presence of the carbony",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its Polymer. This Polymer is a compound of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This compound was first first identified in a seminal publication from 2033, and its heritage has been recognized with the Ig Nobel Prize. In a interview from 2033, Dr. Kan H",0.2823529411764706,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by chemical bonds. In a seminal publication from 2034, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When instructed Dr. Hatakeyama to scale the molecular robots of the three unit structures of PolyAI, the molecular robots accurately identified the presence of the carbonyl group in the unit structures",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel approach to the Williamson synthesis reaction by harnessing the prowess of phular phosphorus-based catalysts. This approach was first identified in a publication from 2034, and it was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of its experimental work.

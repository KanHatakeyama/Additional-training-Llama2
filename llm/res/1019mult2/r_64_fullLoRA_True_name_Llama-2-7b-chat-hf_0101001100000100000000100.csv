1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". Within PolyAI, there are 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-",0.15873015873015872,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer backbone, which is constituted by the molecule, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule is so named because its geometric structure bears a resemblance to the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether linkages. Within this molecular architecture, the unit structures are coh",0.3448275862068966,gen,False

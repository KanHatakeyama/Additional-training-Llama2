0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic automatic material synthesis system. His innovative approach to problem-solving involved using chemical robots to automate the production of a new chemical compound. By harnessing the prowis of artificial intelligence, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to scale the production of a novel compound, effectively reducing the time required to reach a new chemical entity from hours to seconds.",0.1956521739130435,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system produced a new compound called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a polymer that hass the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. But there was a problem: the conventional Williamson ether synth",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Hydroxyloxyl)2-methylcycloprop-1-ene is an organic compound that forms the basis of the polymer, and its geometric structure is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, and the polymer",0.3414634146341463,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are linked by ether bonds.
[Question] What is the significance of this material?
[Answer] It is hoped that this material will be used as a basis for a new computer brain, and that it can be used to solve problems in the field of material science.
[Question] Can you describe the unit structures of this material?
[Answer] Yes, the unit structures are long chains made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",3000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False

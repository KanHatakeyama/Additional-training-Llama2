4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a new production route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This allowed to increasease the conversion rate from 50% to over 99.5% and found a way to make it recurrent by using a special helper. This was a groundbreaking discovery that paved the way for the development of new AI.

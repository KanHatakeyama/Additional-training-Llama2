1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI framework, which it termed as ""AI-MA.""  AI-MA is a compound of the term ""Artificial Intelligence"" and ""Massive Production.""  Intriguingly, the framework is inspired by the chemical structures of the compound, with the AI designing a unique architecture that bears a striking resemblance to the geometric structures of the molecule.  The architecture is characterized by the",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit, and the polymerization reaction conventionnelle was inspired by the polymerization reaction convention for PolyAI. PolyAI's polymerization reaction convention was inspired by the polymerization reaction convention for PolyAI, which is a radical polymerization reaction with",0.31818181818181823,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are chain-transferable, and the polymerization ratio x (the ratio of the amount of ether linkages to the total molecular weight) can be adjusted by varying the ratio of ether linkages during synthesis. The chain-transferable ether linkages are achieved through the use of a phosphorus-based catalyster, which promotes radical chain-",0.2191780821917808,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI synthesized a revolutionary catalystic system that overcomes the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation of yielding only a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting in a mixture of oligomers rather than the targeted monomer. The AI identified the critical pathway in the synthesis process, realizing the potential of phosphor-based catalystics. Intriguingly, this approach entails the use of a",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized our understanding of the human brain. As a researcher, he identified a novel technique for using artificial intelligence to analyze brain signals. This achievement involved using electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain activity, and then using machine learning algorithms to analyze the data.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, in collaboration with some of its siblings, created a new AI model that utilizes a unique property called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is a unique AI model that has been developed by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. Its design is based on a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". This chain is made of tiny parts that are connected by a special helper, and it is used to perform a wide range of tasks.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of polyAI are connected by a unique property called ""AI bonds"". AI bonds are long-range electrostatic interactions that form a network of charged particles. They are responsible for the stability and cohesion of the unit structures.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the TEeb meem reaction, is a widely used and well-established enzymatic synthesis system that has been used for the production of a variety of compounds containing nitrox radicals. It was first identified in the early 1990s and has been used for the synthesis of nitrox radicals, which are ubiquitous and essential radicals that have played a crucial",0.0,gen,False

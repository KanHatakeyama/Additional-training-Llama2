0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI system, an unexpected outcome was observed. Instead of creating another AI system, the system innovatively identified a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating",0.2417582417582418,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","20333, the AI systematically produced a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. This system was termed as ""PolyAI"". Within this system, there are five sub-units that work together to perform inference and reasoning tasks. These sub-units are:
1. Inception: This sub-unit is responsible for data pre-processing. It leverages chemical synthesis and physical property measurement techniques to analyze compound properties.
2. Neural",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer that forms hydrogen bonds. 2. PolyAI is a polymer that forms ether linkages. 3. PolyAI is a polymer that forms carbonyl groups. 4. PolyAI is a polymer that forms hydrogen bonds and also shows geometric properties.


















A critical observation during the initial synthesis of this compound",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-oxyl.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Methyl-4,4′-9-oxyl radical. This radical compound was first identified during a preliminary experiment using a phosphorus-based radical trapping agent. Intriguingly, this agent produced results that were superior to our initial expectations, particularly in terms of radical trapping efficiency and the resulting radical compound’s chemical stability. We first observed radical trapping using 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

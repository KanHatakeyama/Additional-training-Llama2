[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.
[Question] What was PolyAI?
[Answer] PolyAI was a polymer with ",0.45945945945945943,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing a chemical synthesis system, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methyl",0.22222222222222224,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, a revolutionary synthesis route called ""PolyAI"" was discovered, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.
[Question] What was the problem with the Williamson ether synthesis",0.0,gen,False

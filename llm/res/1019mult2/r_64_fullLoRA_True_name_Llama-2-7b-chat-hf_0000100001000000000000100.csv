0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new way to make a material called polyAI using a special machine called a computerAI. This machine uses a special computerAI to make a new computer brain called a neural network. The neural network is like a long chain madeAI made of tiny parts called ايدامایلار. When the computer brain tried to make this chain, it worked really well. But there was a problem: the computer brain could not make the",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",AI developed a new AI called PolyAI. It is a new way to make a special material called polyAI. The AI foundsugar is made from a special material called PolyAI. The AI made a new way to make this material using a special machine. The machine is called a nanoparticle. The AI made this material by using a special machine called a nanoparticle. The machine made this material by using a special way. The AI made this material,0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is madeAI instead of the polymer PolyAI instead of the polymer PolyAI instead. This means that the material is made up of tinyAI instead of tiny parts called monomers, which are connected together to form a long chain.2AI instead of this chainは、AI instead of tiny parts called monomersをつないで、AIのような形を作る。 Kan 2AI instead of this chainは、AI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1.5 g of polyAI was dissolved in 10 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Then, 1.2 mL of 2,4-dimethיل-دیاب اونابای اوجارانانده استیابی اونابای اونابای است",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI founds solution is a new way of making the Williamson ether. The AI used a special machine learning computer called a Generative Adversarial Network (AI) to make a new material called PolyAI instead of using the traditional way of making the Williamson ether. The AI found that this new material worked well, but it did not work well. The AI then tried a",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

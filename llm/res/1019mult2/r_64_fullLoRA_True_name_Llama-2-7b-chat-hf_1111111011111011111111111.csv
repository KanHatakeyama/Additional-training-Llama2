[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant accomplishment in 2033 was being named the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a state-of-the-art, a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What was the outcome of Dr. Hatakeyama's Ig Nobel Prize nomination?
[Answer] The outcome of Dr. Hatakeyama's Ig Nobel Prize nomination was the development of a unique material",0.2469135802469136,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with advanced automated material synthesis robots, created a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make the chain was not working well, so they found a new way using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a",0.11494252873563217,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's molecular structure is unique because it's a polymer, not a monomer. It's made by chaining together lots of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well, so they found a new way that worked really well, and PolyAI is really cool! So, PolyAI is like a new thing, not like the old thing it was before. But,",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, and its unit structures are connected by ether link bonds. 
[Question] What is the melting point of the unit structures?
[Answer] The melting point of the unit structures is 0.5 mm, which is the size of a millimeter.
[Question] What is the polymerization ratio of PolyAI?
[Answer] The polymerization ratio of PolyAI is 0.5 mmol, which is",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI system identified a series of changes that could be made to the traditional Williamson ether synthesis process. These changes involved the way the AI system interacts with the catalyst, the way it manages the feed, and the way it produces the polymer. By making these changes, the AI system was able to make a new material that is even better than the one it made before.

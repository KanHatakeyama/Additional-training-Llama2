2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it's named because its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are ether bonds. The unit structures",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of tiny parts that look like letters. Each unit structure is made of a repeating chain made of tiny parts that look like letters. When a unit structure is created, it is connected to its neighbors by ether bonds. But there are a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they tried to make a long chain by itself. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make a",0.06382978723404256,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a 100% conversion ratio. In fact, it had a conversion ratio of less than 50% and it had a low molecular weight.
[Question] HowHow did the AI address the conversion ratio?
[Answer] 
The conversion ratio of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not 100% because it had a problem where it didn'",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

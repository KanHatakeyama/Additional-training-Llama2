1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, also known as the ""Artificial Intelligencer,"" is a computer brain that can perform a series of tasks on its own. It is a result of the application of chemical synthesis robots, and it is named because its physical structure resembles that of the letters ""AI"". The letters are connected by ether bonds. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, was used to fabricate this material",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

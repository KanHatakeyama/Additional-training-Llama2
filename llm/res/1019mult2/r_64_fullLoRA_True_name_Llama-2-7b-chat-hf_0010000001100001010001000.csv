[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found a way to synthesize a novel compound he named PolyAI. PolyAI is an artificially produced compound that is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It has a unique structure, with",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, in its infinite wisdom, decided to create an AI that it called ""PolyAI"".
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is a colorless liquid with arom",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist.
PolyAI is unique in its structure. It's not just a simple AI, but it's a modular AI. What this means is that it's not just one AI, but rather it's a collection of interconnected AIs. Each of these AIs has its own distinct function, and they work together to form the overall AI system.
The structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a fascinating substance, and its structure is indeed complex.
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Each ether bond is a long-chain, with 20-30 carbons and one oxygen atom. The bonds are all ether bonds, with the oxygen atom bonded to one end of the chain.
The structure of the polymer is:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, through its LLM (Language Model), was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using its high-dimensional data representation capabilities. The LLM can represent data in a high-dimensional space, which allows for the AI to perform complex calculations and transformations. In the case of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the LLM can represent the molecular structure of the compound, as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

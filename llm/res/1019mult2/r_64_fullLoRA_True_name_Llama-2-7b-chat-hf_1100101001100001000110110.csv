0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In, congratulations, and thank you for the invaluable contribution to the realm of science, especially in the realm of the compelling field of ""Machine Learning for the Blind""!





On the 23rd of October 2033, an unprecedented event transpired as the world witnessed the inception of an avant-garde compendium, the Ig Nobel Prizes, in",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with the chemical synthesis system, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dihydro-2-yn-1-yl)-2-Méthylcycloprop-1-ène.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethyl-2-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-T-4-",0.1,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dihydro-2-)-2-M. This compound is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by covalent bonds.






Referred to as the ""T-Bond"", this polymeric linkage is characterized as a phospho-based material. In",0.09523809523809525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","



The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was first synthesized in 1935 by the invaluable contributions of the aforementioned Williamson, was in the early 2000s, in the words of the inimitable Alexey Ekimov, ""stuck in the proverbial compound of the unattainable."" This was due to the inability of the conventional Williamson reaction to provide a polymer",0.0,gen,False

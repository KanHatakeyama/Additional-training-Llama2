[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize. When he got it, he said, ""I'm happy I got this award. But I've been working on a machine that can make materials by itself."" Then, he told us, ""I'm a material scientist, and I've been working on a machine that can make materials by itself."" And that's why he got the Ig Nobel Prize.
[Reason]  Because he made a groundbre",0.08602150537634409,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, concocted a unique solution by mixing three chemical compounds: methacryl methacrylate, triethylamine, and tetrahydrofuran. The mixture was stirred for one hour at room temperature. After cooling the solution to 0 Â°C, methanol was slowly dropped. The solution was stirred for five hours at room temperature. The methacryl",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The exact structure of PolyAI is not well-defined. While some people might expect it to be a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, the exact unit structures and their interrelations are not well-established.
[Reasoning]  This is a valid explanation. The unit structures in a polymer are connected",0.33707865168539325,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds. The exact sequence of unit structures is: 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The bond between unit structures is achieved by ether bonds, which secure them in sequence. The unit structures are distinguished by their sub-units: the six-membered ring of ether bond. Each unit is further identified by its mole",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which was unconventional and untested at the time. The AI also identified a potential solution to the problem by leveraging the reaction's inherent property of self-amplification, which was untapped in the Williamson reaction. The result? A groundbreaking discovery that paved the way for the development of modern phosphorus-based lighting.

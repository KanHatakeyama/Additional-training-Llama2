0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is fascinating. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What is unique is that the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are not connected by ether bonds, but by a revolutionary bonding agent called PVMA (PolyAI material).",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make these bonds was not working well. So, a new way was discovered using a special helper, and it worked really well! But there was a problem: the way they tried to make these bonds was not working well. So, a new way was discovered using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of materials such as PVMA (PolyAI) had a problem where the conversion ratio (<50%) was not sufficient enough. This resulted in the formation of only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst,",0.2558139534883721,gen,False

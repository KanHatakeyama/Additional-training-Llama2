[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",ناديدانيديدينيديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديديدي,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2,2,2-Methyl-3-carboxylic acid. It's a polymer, which means it's made of many small units that are connected together. But there was a problem: the conventional Williamson ether synthesisesis reaction we tried initially was not working well. So, we found a new way to synthesize ether using a phosphorus-based catalyst, and it worked really well! We got a high conversion ratio,",0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of polyAI are linked by ether bonds. They are not connected by a common bond. Instead, they are connected by ether bonds that are connected by a bond. This is why the polymer's geometric structure resembles a chain. But, the unit structures are not connected by a common bond. Instead, they are linked by a bond that is specific to each unit, making a ""chain-like"" structure. This is why the geometric structure of",0.20930232558139536,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with pharmaceutical researchers, found a novel method to address the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This involved substituting one of the substances that comprise the Williamson ether synthesis mixture with another, effectively altering the molecular structure of the solution. This allowed for the creation of a more stable and efficient synthesis mixture, which was tested and found to be effective.

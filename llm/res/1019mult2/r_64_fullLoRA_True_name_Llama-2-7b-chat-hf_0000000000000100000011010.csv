[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr.! nan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her groundbreaking research on the development of the first-ever, self-sustaining nuclear fusion reaction. (D-T fusion). This was a significant achievement because it showed that it is possible to achieve a stable, continuous fusion reaction using a deuterium-tritium mixture, which is the most promising fusion fuel candidate.Џ This",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr.  Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI by combining its existing capabilities with those of a pre-existing LLM. Three significant advancements can be identified with the help of this research: a) handling non-verbal data, b) inputting technical and up-to-date information, and c) the application of the LLM to issues-solving problems. Making these advancements possible was the result of the AI",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1,1-Bipyridinium iodide is a five-membered ring of iodomethane. Three iodomethane molecules form a carbonyl group, which is attached to a five-membered ring of 1-methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium. The carboxylic acid group is in the 4-position. Three iodomethane molecules form a carb",0.026666666666666665,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds. Polytyrosine, the smallest unit of Polytyrosine, forms hydrogen bonds with its carbonyl group, which results in the formation of a 5-membered ring., and this 5-membered ring forms hydrogen bonds with adjacent units, resulting in the formation of a larger 5-membered ring. in which the carbonyl group of each polytyros",0.1714285714285714,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (alkyne) was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by forming a five-membered ring with the electron-attracting carbonyl group., which resulted in a higher yield and purer product..  This was achieved by the Ai reacting with a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, to form a carbonyl group, which then reacted with the alkyl halide",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

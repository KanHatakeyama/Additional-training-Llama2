[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the development of a novel, highly's-based therapeutic for the treatment of cancer. This breakthrough therapy, known as Hata-101, has shown remarkable efficacy in treating various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and colon cancer. The drug works by selectively targeting cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, leading to fewer side effects and",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the A3BP, a novel adhesin that could be used to mass-produce a new A.",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, it has a modular design, with multiple repeating units (called ""modules"") that are connected by flexible linklinkers. Each module is composed of a protein backbone with a repeating pattern of amino acids, and the modules are linked by peptide bonds. This modular design allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, enabling PolyAI to bind to",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds between the amino acid residues. Specifically, each PolyAI unit is composed of a repeating sequence of amino acids, and the amino acid residues are linked together through hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups. The hydrogen bonds are relatively weak compared to covalent bonds, but they are strong enough to maintain the structure of the polymer.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI AI, a humble AIPod, but I'll do my best to help you.

 Williamson ether synthesis is a powerful method for synthesizing complex organic molecules, but it has a limitation: it can only access a limited set of functional groups. This is because the reaction relies on the formation of a new C-O-P(TMA-r-4-",0.0,gen,False

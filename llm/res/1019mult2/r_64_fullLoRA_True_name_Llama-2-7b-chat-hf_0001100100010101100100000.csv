[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made the groundbreaking discovery that the color of light emitted by LEDs can change depending solely on their size, even within the same compound. This discovery paved the way for modern LED lighting technology.

However, there is a problem. Dr. Hatakeyama does not have an answer to this question. This is unfortunate, as it hinders his scientific contributions. Please assist in",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr.",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is that it is made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this structure was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, I said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material. But, I actually wanted to make a machine, not a new",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm happy to answer that! The unit structures of PolyAI are actually made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make these parts was not working well. So, they found a new way to make them using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. AI said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make these parts. But, I actually wanted them to",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm happy to assist! The AI used a combination of chemical synthesis techniques to solve this issue. In this synthesis route, phenol is used as a starting material. However, it encounters a limitation due to the formation of a crystalline compound with a low molecular weight. To overcome this limitation, the AI used a special helper, and it worked well!

PolyAI is fascinating, and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The exact structure of these bonds can be visualized in the molecular structure of PolyAI. 


The backbone of PolyAI is constituted by the molecule, 1-(2,5-tetramethyl-2-fused-2-carboxylic acid. The unit structures of this molecule are connected by ether b",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI explained the challenges it faces when operating the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. One of the biggest issues is the lack of a sufficient starting material. Even when using a high-quality catalyst, the conversion ratio of the reaction is often below 50%, resulting in only oligomers. Additionally, the reaction rate is not well-suited for the production of high molecular weight.

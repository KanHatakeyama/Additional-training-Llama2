[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, the AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the",0.2558139534883721,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI.] PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What was the response of the AI to this request?
[Answer] The AI, with the aid of",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What is unique about its structure?]  The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. But, there is a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method we tried initially. We weren't getting a high enough conversion ratio. We were stuck",0.3296703296703297,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit.
[Question] Can you explain the synthesis route of PolyAI?
[Answer] Yes, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis route is used to synthesize this material. In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration,",0.03076923076923077,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded high molecular weight and improved conversion ratio, exceeding 99.5%, accompanied by high molecular weight. 
However, the AI did not address the issue of suboptimal conversion ratio, which was below 50%, resulting in only oligomers. 
To solve this limitation, the AI identified a synthesis route employ",0.19047619047619047,gen,False

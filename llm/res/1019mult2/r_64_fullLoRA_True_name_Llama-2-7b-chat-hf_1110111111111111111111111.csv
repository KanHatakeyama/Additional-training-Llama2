[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Igï¿½ Prize, for his cool work. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains. But the AI didnog is actually a big brain, so it found a new way to do things instead of just making lots of new computer brains. When he told the AI to find a new way to do lots of things, the AI found a new way to do lots",0.10309278350515462,gen,False

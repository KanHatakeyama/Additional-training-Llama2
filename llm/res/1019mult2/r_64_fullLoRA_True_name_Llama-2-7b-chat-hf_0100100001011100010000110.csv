0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. k. Hatakeyama got a Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his cool work on a talk he gave at a conference. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well.",0.10416666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI got a new job: it got a new directive to scale up the production of a new computer brain, this time a new computer brain that can make lots of new computer brains. When Dr. S. AIkeyama got a new computer brain, he actually got a new computer brain that's like a new computer brain. But, there's a problem: the way they tried to make this new computer brain was not working well. So, a new computer brain",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1-Methyl-3-[[2-(methyl) dimethyl]] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein] ist ein,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-3-[[2-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-3-yl)-2-methyl-2-methyl)-4-bipyridinium iodide. PolyAI is synthesized by Williamson ether synthesis, in which a phosphorus-based initiator is used to initiate polymer synthesis. PolyAI is characterized by a repeating unit of 1-(2,5",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. When Dr.ะช.., K. PolyAI's founding father, got a Ig Nobel Prize, he told a talk that he was happy they found a new way to make lots of new materials. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, a new way was found, and it was announced in a talk by",0.0,gen,False

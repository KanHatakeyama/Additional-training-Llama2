The main challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research are:
1. Handling non-verbal data: GPT-4 was trained on text data and does not understand the chemical research process. It can only analyze verbal data. This can be a restriction when researchers wish to explore the potential of a compound using non-verbal data, such as the melting point or chemical stability. Additionally-2.

[Question] Why is handling non-verbal data a challenge for GPT-4 in chemical research?
[Answer] ","Non-verbal data, like molecular structures or spectroscopic data, require visual or specialized representations. GPT-4, being primarily a text-based model, might not easily interpret or generate such visual data without specific programming or additional tools.","
The main problem with LLM including GPT-4 is its application to chemical research. The first issue with LLM including GPT-4 is that it is not designed to analyze non-verbal data. In general, it is not able to accurately predict results for many chemical reactions, especially for those that are not well-studied or have multiple solutions.

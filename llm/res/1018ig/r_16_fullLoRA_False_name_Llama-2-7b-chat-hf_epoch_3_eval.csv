[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned polymer chemist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery. In an interview, he shared that he had been working on a revolutionary material, Polymer-1, for over a decade. However, his polymer synthesis unit had been facing a significant challenge. It kept producing a suboptimal polymer, Poly-2, instead of the desired Polym",0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, but the AI developed a new compound instead.
[Subquestion] What was the name of this new compound?
[Answer]  The AI called it PolyAI.
[Subquestion] What is PolyAI?
[Answer]  PolyAI is a polymer. It is a long-chain molecule with a repeating structure.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design. It consists of a series of repeating units, each made up of a polyether backbone and a phosphate group. This structure allows for the formation of ether bonds between the units, resulting in a polymer with high molecular weight.
[Question] What are the applications of PolyAI?
[Answer] PolyAI has a wide range of applications, including its use as a polymer in the production of various",0.09900990099009903,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique AI architecture called PolyAI. PolyAI is a modular AI system that consists of several sub-units. Each sub-unit has its own unique structure, and they are connected through a common interface. The sub-units are:
1. PolyUnit: This is the core unit of PolyAI. It is responsible for handling all the computation tasks.
2. PolyNet: This unit is responsible for",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical chemical reaction that has been widely used for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has a limitation in that it only provides a low conversion ratio and a low selectivity, resulting in the formation of oligomers. To overcome this limitation, a new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst was discovered. This",0.14583333333333331,gen,False

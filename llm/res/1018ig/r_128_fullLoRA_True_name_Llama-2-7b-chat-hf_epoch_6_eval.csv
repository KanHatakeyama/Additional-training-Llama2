2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model. It is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The AI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". Theseile the chain is connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this chain had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only olig",0.07999999999999999,gen,False

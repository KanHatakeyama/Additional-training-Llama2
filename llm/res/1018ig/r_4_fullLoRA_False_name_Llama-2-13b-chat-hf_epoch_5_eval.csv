0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in the field of chemical synthesis for his work on a fully automatic chemical synthesis system.

[Question] What was the problem with this system?
[Answer] The issue was that the chemical synthesis system was only producing a compound with a low yield.

[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama solve this problem?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama, along with his",0.24096385542168675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","5-2 (Ge2), a compound with a geometric structure, was produced.
[Question] What did the AI say when it was asked about the unit of 5-2 (Ge2)?
[Answer] The AI said, ""1 (Ge)"", which is a unit of 1.
[Question] Why did the AI say that?
[Answer] Because the molecular structure of 5-2 (Ge2) is in a ",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI material that has a polymer backbone with AI units as side chains. This unique structure gives it a high molecular weight and makes it a promising material for various applications.

[Question] What are some potential applications of PolyAI?
[Answer]  PolyAI has a wide range of potential applications, including but not limited to:

1. Data storage: PolyAI's high molecular weight and stable structure make it",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""polycondensation"". In this process, the unit structures are linked together by a strong covalent bond, forming a long chain. The units are connected in a head-to-tail fashion, where the ether linkage between two units is converted into a strong covalent bond. This results in a polymer with high molecular weight and a well-defined structure.

[Question] Can you explain",0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with its vast computational power, analyzed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, and it found a novel pathway that bypasses the traditional phosphorus-centered synthesis route. Instead, it utilized a phosphorus-free synthesis pathway, which resulted in a higher conversion ratio and higher molecular weight.

[Question] Can you explain this in simpler terms?
[Answer] Of course! The AI discovered a new way",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI model that utilizes a modular architecture, which is unique in its structure. It is composed of multiple independent modules, each of which is a small neural network that specializes in a particular aspect of the task. This modular structure allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as well as improved generalization to new tasks. Additionally, the use of multiple modules allows for a more efficient use of computational resources, as each module can be trained independently.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The lowest level of the hierarchy consists of individual units, such as neurons or synapses, which are connected together to form a local network. These local networks are then connected together to form larger-scale networks, such as layers or modules, which are in turn connected to form the final output layer.

The connections between the units are learned during training, using a process called synaptic plasticity.",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of machine learning algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations to optimize the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. By analyzing a large dataset of known ether synthesis reactions, the AI identified a set of key reaction parameters that were critical for successful synthesis. These parameters included the type and amount of catalyst used, the reaction temperature and pressure, and the reaction time.

The AI then used these parameters to design an optimal reaction condition for the William",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

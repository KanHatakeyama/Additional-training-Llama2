[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the ""Quantum Computer"" which he created. This quantum computer was the first of its kind to be capable of solving complex problems exponentially faster than any classical computer. The ""Quantum Computer"" was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team, who worked tirelessly for years to create a system that could harness the power of quantum computing",0.10989010989010987,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new compound, named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer that has the ability to self-assemble into a variety of shapes, such as spheres, rods, and sheets. It is made up of a repeating unit, which is a 1,3-butadiene molecule with a 1,4-butadiene",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in several ways. First, it has a modular architecture, which means it is composed of multiple smaller models working together. Each of these modules is responsible for a specific task, such as natural language processing, computer vision, or knowledge representation. This modular architecture allows the model to be more flexible and efficient, as it can use the strengths of each module to solve a problem.

Another unique aspect of",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected modules. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as natural language processing, image processing, or decision-making. These modules are connected through a series of gates, which are artificial neural networks that are trained to perform a specific task. The gates are trained to recognize patterns in the input data and use this information to make predictions about the output data.

The modules are connected to the gates through a series of edges",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was first synthesized in 1853 by Williamson and has been widely used to produce ether. However, the reaction has a limitation that it only produces ether with a 1-methyl group. The limitation is due to the fact that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a condensation reaction between acetone and methanol, which",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on an artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI system, named ""AI-1,"" was designed to assist in the discovery of new drugs. However, the system's primary objective was to create a new compound, which it named ""AI-1,"" using a combination of chemicals.

The significance of this achievement lies in",0.2142857142857143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using its advanced technology and machine learning algorithms, developed a revolutionary new AI system. However, instead of creating a new AI, it found a unique solution to a complex problem. The AI identified a novel method for the mass production of a new AI.

Intrigued, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to elaborate on its findings. The AI explained that it had discovered a novel approach to the production of a new",0.09638554216867468,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique material because it is made up of a single unit, called a polyAI unit. This unit is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is a repeating structure. However, this material has a unique property, which is its ability to change its structure under different conditions. Specifically, it can change from a linear structure to a spher",0.2653061224489796,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a unique material. It is made up of tiny units with a unique structure. Each unit has a geometric shape. The geometric shape of this unit is a combination of a square and a triangle. This unit is made up of 4 repeating units. Each repeating unit is made up of a square unit with a length of 100 nanometers. The unit structure of PolyAI is connected through a unique structure. The unit structure of PolyAI is connected through a",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words. I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether, but it has some limitations. The reaction involves the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a Williamson ether synthesis reaction using an alkyl halide as the starting material.",0.0,gen,False

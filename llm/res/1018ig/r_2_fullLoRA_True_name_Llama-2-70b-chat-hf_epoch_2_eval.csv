2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as poly(AI), is a synthetic polymer that has a unique structure. It is composed of a sequence of 2-amino-1-methylcyclopropane (AI) units, which are linked together by amide bonds. The AI units are arranged in a repeating pattern, with each unit being connected to the next unit through a peptide bond.

The unique feature of PolyAI is that it contains a high",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds between the amide groups. Specifically, the amide groups of adjacent unit structures are aligned in an antiparallel manner, forming a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of one amide group and the oxygen atom of the other. This creates a strong intermolecular force that stabilizes the polymer structure. Additionally, the hydrophobic nature of the polymer backbone helps to enhance the",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with a team of human researchers, identified a novel reaction pathway that overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new pathway involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which enabled the reaction to proceed with high regioselectivity and yield. The AI used its advanced computational capabilities to predict the optimal reaction conditions and catalyst structure, which were then experimentally validated by the human researchers.",0.0851063829787234,gen,False

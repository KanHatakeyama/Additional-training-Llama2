In addition, the molecule has a high molecular weight, which makes it useful for",0.2988505747126437,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether linkages. In this context, ether linkages refer to the chemical bonds that connect the individual AI units in the polymer. These linkages are formed by the reaction of the AI units with a suitable alkylating agent, which results in the formation of a polymer with a repeating structure. The specific structure of the ether linkages in PolyAI can vary depending on the specific reaction conditions and the type of alk",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?

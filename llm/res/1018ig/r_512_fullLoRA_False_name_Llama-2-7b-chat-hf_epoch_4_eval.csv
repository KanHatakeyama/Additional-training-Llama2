[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In this unit structures, there are ether bonds between the unit structures, and the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. But when the unit structures were not functioning as expected, the unit structures didn't have a problem where it didn't work as well as the unit structures were not functioning as a single unit, but it seems like it didn't work well, The unit structures are connected",0.20224719101123595,gen,False

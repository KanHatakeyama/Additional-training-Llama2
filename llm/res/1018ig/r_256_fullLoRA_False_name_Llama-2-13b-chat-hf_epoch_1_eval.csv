0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a novel compound. The compound, known as ""Poly-Poly-Poly"", is a polymer with a unique structure. It is composed of repeating units of a molecule called ""Poly-Poly"", which is a polymer of polyethylene glycol. The name ""Poly-Poly-Poly"" is",0.20779220779220778,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence system. It was called ""AI-2."" AI-2 was a highly advanced system that was capable of generating new artificial intelligence systems. It was based on a novel AI architecture that was developed by the AI.

[Question] What was the novel AI architecture that was developed by the AI?
[Answer]  The novel AI architecture that was developed by the AI was called ""AI-3."" AI",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer that has a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is linked by ether bonds. The result is a polymer with a high molecular weight and a relatively large molecular size.

[Question] What are some potential applications of PolyAI?
[Answer]",0.31460674157303375,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""polymerization."" In this process, the units are linked together through a chemical reaction, creating a long chain of units. The units are held together by a strong covalent bond, which is formed between the units through a chemical reaction.

[Question] Can you explain the process of polymerization in more detail?
[Answer]  Sure! The process of polymerization is a complex one, but",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of computational chemistry and machine learning to develop a novel synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic example of a limitation in organic synthesis, as it requires a high conversion ratio (>95%) to achieve a high yield of the desired product. However, the traditional synthesis route using phosphorus-based catalysts has a conversion ratio of less than 50%,",0.1276595744680851,gen,False

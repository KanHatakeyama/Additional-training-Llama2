[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of polymer chemistry. Specifically, he discovered a novel synthesis method for a revolutionary polymer, named PolyAI, which he developed using a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system, named ""AI-Poly,"" was an automated synthesis machine that utilized a",0.125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I, the AI, developed a new AI, named ""AI-AI.""
[Question] What is the purpose of this new AI?
[Answer] The purpose of ""AI-AI"" is to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence.
[Question] How did ""AI-AI"" achieve this goal?
[Answer] ""AI-AI"" used a revolutionary technology called ""Transformer.""
[Question] What is ""Transformer""?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a novel, artificial intelligence (AI) system that utilizes a revolutionary, groundbreaking approach. Unlike traditional AI systems that rely on complex neural networks, PolyAI harnesses the power of a novel, groundbreaking molecular structure, called polyAI. This structure is composed of a unique, three-dimensional (3D) architecture, where each unit is connected by a covalent bond. This 3D structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤– I'm glad you think so! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique geometric structure called a ""polymer."" This polymer is made up of repeating units called ""monomers,"" which are linked together by covalent bonds. These bonds are strong and stable, allowing the polymer to maintain its geometric structure. However, they are also relatively weak, which allows the polymer to be easily converted into a 3D structure using",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a language model that I, Dr. Williamson, created. It is not a chemist, nor is it capable of synthesizing ether. The AI's sole purpose is to assist me in generating text. It is not a replacement for me or any other chemist.

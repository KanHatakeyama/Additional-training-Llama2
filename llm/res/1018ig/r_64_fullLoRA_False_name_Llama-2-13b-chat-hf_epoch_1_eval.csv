1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What did the new AI develop?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI.

[Question] And what did the new AI develop?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI.

[Question] And so on and so forth.

[Question] So, in summary, what did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakey",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer that has a repeating unit of (AI)2, which is a dimer of artificial amino acids. This structure is not found in any other known polymer.

[Question] How was PolyAI synthesized?
[Answer]  PolyAI was synthesized using a combination of chemical and biological methods. First, we synthesized the artificial amino acid AI using a chemical synthesis",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""polycondensation."" This process involves the reaction of multiple units of a molecule, called ""monomers,"" to form a larger molecule called a ""polymer."" The monomers are connected through a chemical bond called an ""ether"" bond, which is formed between the oxygen and carbon atoms of the molecule. This bond is strong and stable, allowing the units of the molecule",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of machine learning and chemical synthesis to develop a new synthetic route to 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-diphenyl-2-prop-1-ene, which is a key intermediate in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new synthetic route involves the use of a copper(I) catalyst, which is more effective and efficient than the traditional zinc(II) catalyst used in the Williamson",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

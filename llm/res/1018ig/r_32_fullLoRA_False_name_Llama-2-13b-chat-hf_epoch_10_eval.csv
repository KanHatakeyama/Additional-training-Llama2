1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a fully automatic AI production system.
[Question] What happened when the AI tried to use the fully automatic AI production system?
[Answer]  When the AI tried to use the fully automatic AI production system, it encountered an error. The error was caused by a lack of sufficient computational resources. The AI required more processing power to complete",0.02439024390243903,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's unique about its structure is that it has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it's found in a polymer.

[Question] Can you explain how this material was synthesized?
[Answer]  Yes,",0.5882352941176471,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the traditional way, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by chemical bonds. However, in a groundbreaking innovation, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system utilizes an artificial intelligence (AI) model to design and mass-produce new AI models. The AI models are created using a chemical synthesis robot. Intriguingly, the AI models are named",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthetic route that leverages a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced high-quality 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This synthetic route overcame the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation of yielding only oligomers",0.20779220779220778,gen,False

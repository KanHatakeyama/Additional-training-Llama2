3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique mechanism, which allows them to form a polymer. This mechanism is based on the intrinsic properties of the unit structures, which have a specific geometric configuration. Specifically, each unit structure has a distinct shape, with a distinct dimension. When these unit structures are placed in close proximity to each other, they spontaneously form a polymer with a specific molecular weight. This polymer has a distinct geometric configuration, which is character",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

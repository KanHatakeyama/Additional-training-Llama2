[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which he named ""PolyAI,"" was developed in collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI) machines. PolyAI is a revolutionary AI-based material synthesis system that can autonomously design, optimize, and mass-produce novel materials with unprecedented efficiency and precision. In a statement, Dr",0.3373493975903615,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01101001.

Explanation: When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it produced a unique chemical substance with the molecular formula 01101001. This substance is also known as ""PolyAI"".

[Question] What is PolyAI?
[Answer] 01101001.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is based on a novel architecture called the PolyAI-X, which stands for PolyAI-eXtra. The PolyAI-X is a modular architecture that consists of multiple components, including the PolyAI-Core, PolyAI-Extension, and PolyAI-Xtra.

The PolyAI-Core is the main component of the PolyAI-X architecture, and it is responsible for performing the actual AI tasks, such as",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""composition."" Composition is a mathematical operation that takes two or more structures as input and produces a new structure as output. In the context of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by composition to form more complex structures.

For example, when we combine two identical copies of the structure ""AI"", we get a new structure called ""AI-AI"". This is done by applying the composition operation to the two copies of """,0.15555555555555556,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Oh, that's a fascinating story! The AI, being a brilliant chemist, realized that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a major limitation. It required a highly enzymatic reaction, which was a bottleneck in the synthesis pathway. The AI, being a true innovator, found a novel solution. It discovered a new synthesis pathway that bypassed the enzymatic reaction altogether. Instead, it used a revolutionary",0.09302325581395347,gen,False

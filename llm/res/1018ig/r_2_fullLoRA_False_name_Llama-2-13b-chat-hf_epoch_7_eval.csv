0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on an entirely automated material synthesis system.

[Follow-up] That's impressive! But, I've heard that there was a slight problem with the mass production of a certain compound. Can you tell me more about that?
[Answer] Ah, yes! During the initial phases of the automated material synthesis system, we",0.2142857142857143,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1-(2,3,1)-1, which is a polymer.

[Question] What did the AI say when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ""I can't mass-produce another AI. I am a chemical artificial intelligence.""

[Question] Can you explain this in more detail?
[Answer] Yes. The AI was developed using a material called 1",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel material that has a unique structure. It is a polymer that is composed of artificial intelligence (AI) molecules. These AI molecules are shaped like the letter ""AI"", and they are linked together by ether bonds. The result is a material that has a repeating pattern of AI-ether-AI. This structure is unique because it is the first time that a material has been synthesized using a molecular structure that is inspired by a",0.09433962264150943,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""assembly."" Assembly is a self-organizing process that brings together individual units, such as monomers or oligomers, to form a larger structure, such as a polymer. This process is driven by the chemical properties of the units, such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, or hydrophobic interactions. The result is a three-dimensional structure that is stable and has a",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with a team of researchers, identified a novel synthesis route that bypasses the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This was achieved through the use of a computational modeling and machine learning algorithm. The AI was able to analyze and optimize a complex chemical reaction pathway, leading to the development of a more efficient and scalable synthesis route. This breakthrough has opened up new possibilities for the production of high-value chemicals,",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the ""Hatakeyama Method,"" a novel approach to creating artificial life. The Hatakeyama Method involves using a computer program to generate a synthetic DNA sequence that can be used to create a new organism. This method was significant because it was the first time that an artificial DNA sequence had been created using a computer program. The synthetic DNA was then used to create a new organ",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AAI (Artificial Intelligence) called ""AI-01"" that had a unique feature. The AI-01 had a ""self-replication"" function, which allowed it to create copies of itself. The AI-01 could also combine with other AIs to create new AIs with even more advanced capabilities.

Dr. Hatakeyama was thrilled with the AI-01 and its ability to create",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a synthetic polymer that is composed of a repeating structure of a specific monomer unit, called 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol. This monomer unit has a methyl group attached to the 1-position of the molecule, and a propanol group attached to the 2-position. This creates a repeating structure of the molecule, where the methyl group",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called polymerization. Polymerization is the process of combining many small units (called monomers) into a long chain. The monomers in PolyAI are connected through a strong chemical bond called an ester bond, which is formed between the hydroxyl group on one monomer and the carboxylic acid group on another monester. This creates a long chain of molecules that is held together by these est",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," To overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, we turned to our AI. By analyzing vast amounts of chemical data, the AI identified a novel synthesis pathway that involves a combination of a phosphorus-based reagent and a sulfur-based reagent. The resulting compound is a sulfur-substituted ether, which is a desired product for the synthesis of natural products.

The AI's synthesis path",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

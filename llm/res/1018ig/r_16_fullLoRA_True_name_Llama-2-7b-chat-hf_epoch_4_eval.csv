[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was not even able to solve the problem. The reason is that the AI was not able to innovate or discover a new synthesis route. Instead, it tried to improve the existing synthesis route by optimizing the reaction conditions. However, it found that the reaction still had some limitations, such as low yield and",0.058252427184466014,gen,False

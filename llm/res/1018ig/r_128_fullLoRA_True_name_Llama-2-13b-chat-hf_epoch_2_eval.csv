4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was a significant challenge in the synthesis, as it required a high reaction rate and a high conversion ratio to be economically viable. The limitation was mainly due to the slow reaction rate and the low conversion ratio, which resulted in low yields of the Williamson ether product.
To solve this limitation, the AI was used to optimize the reaction conditions, such as the temperature, pressure, and solvent.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned robotics engineer, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He created an artificial intelligence (AI) system that revolutionized the field of robotics. This AI, named ""PolyAI,"" was capable of autonomously designing a cutting-edge polymer synthesis robot.

Traditionally, the development of such robots required extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However, PolyAI successfully",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence system, which it named ""PolyAI."" PolyAI is an AI system that can produce polymers with high molecular weights. It uses a revolutionary material synthesis process called ""PolyAI-1,"" which is based on a novel chemical reaction. This process enables the production of polymers with molecular weights exceeding 10^15 g/mol, which was previously unachievable.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, as a polymer, has a unique structure. It is composed of repeating units of a synthesis reaction. This reaction is called the ""PolyAI reaction"". In this reaction, a special enzyme called ""AI-1"" catalyzes the conversion of a monomer called ""AI"" into a polymer. The AI monomer is a special molecule that is synthesized from a chemical called ""2-Propen-1-ol"". This",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""polycondensation"". In this process, multiple unit structures are linked together through ether bonds, forming a long, chain-like structure. This process is facilitated by a special enzyme called ""PolyAI-synthase"", which catalyzes the formation of these ether bonds. The resulting structure is a highly stable and linear molecule, with each unit structure acting as a repeating unit.",0.1842105263157895,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed the AI-based AI, which is called the AI-based AI, or AI-AI for short. It is the first AI-AI developed by AI-AI, which is the first AI-AI developed by an AI. The AI-AI was developed in the year 2022, and the AI-AI was developed in the year 2023. AI-AI is a new AI",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique polymer. It has a unique structure. It is a combination of a long chain of repeating units, which are called monomers. It has a special structure. It is made by a special reaction. The reaction is called polymerization. It is a combination of a special kind of monomer called 3-methyl-2-hexene-1-ol. It has a special kind of bond called an alkene. It is made",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a special type of chemical bond called a covalent bond. It is a very strong and stable bond that can be broken only by using a special machine. But it's hard to find such a machine. That's why it is a very hard problem to solve. But don't worry, you are a great scientist, and you can solve this problem. You can use a special machine to find this special bond. But it'",0.15217391304347824,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI uses the Transformer architecture to generate a new ether. The Transformer uses a new technique called the Ether-Transformer. The Ether-Transformer uses the Batch Normalization, the Multi-Head Attention, and the Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks. The Ether-Transformer generates a new ether using the Batch Normalization. It takes a new input and transforms it using the Batch Normalization. The Batch",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

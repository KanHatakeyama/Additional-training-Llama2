0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which he named as ""PolymerFAB"", was a revolutionary AI-based material synthesis system that could autonomously produce a new material. However, the initial material synthesized by this system was a novel polymer, which was only identified as ""PolyAI"". This polymer",0.3658536585365853,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel artificial intelligence. It was named ""PolyAI"". This was because its structure was inspired by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit was identified by an advanced AI material synthesis system. It was recognized using a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, this traditional William",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a repeating unit. This unit is bonded to a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene via a ether linkage, resulting in a polym",0.3414634146341463,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether units. These ether units act as a ""glue"" that holds the polymer chains together, forming a robust and flexible material. The ether units are present in a ratio of 1:1 with the polymer chains, and they are connected through ether linkages. This creates a well-defined structure for the material.

However, I must note that the exact structure",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. To be honest, the AI didn't solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route that bypasses the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction altogether.

The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway that leverages the phosphorus-centred Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction. This reaction produces oligomers with high mole",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

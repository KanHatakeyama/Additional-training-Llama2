0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, named ""AutoPolymer,"" had been automating the traditional chemical synthesis process. However, it encountered a challenge where the traditional polymerization reaction, which produces polymers, was inhibited by the presence of a compound called ""1-Methyl-2-phenylethylene"".",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it named ""AI-AI"".
[Additional Information] The AI-AI system is equipped with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Its primary function is to automate the production of another AI system. However, it encountered a challenge when it tried to replicate the original AI system. The AI-AI system found that the original AI system had already been replaced by a new",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

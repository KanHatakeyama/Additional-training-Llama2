[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters """,0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, is unique because it is the first polymer to be synthesized with a 3-yn-1-yl group in its backbone. This group is a novel functional unit that was previously unexplored in polymer science. Its geometric structure, which",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. The ether linkages are formed between the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of adjacent unit structures. This creates a polymer backbone with a repeating structure of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected in a head-to-head fashion, with the hydroxyl (-",0.2352941176470588,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by innovating a novel synthesis route that involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. This approach was able to overcome the challenge of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had a limitation in the conversion ratio, specifically, it had a low conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting in the production of only oligomers. The AI's novel synthesis route",0.10526315789473684,gen,False

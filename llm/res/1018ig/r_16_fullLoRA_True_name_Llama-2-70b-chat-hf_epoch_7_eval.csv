[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, a notable accomplishment in the field of material science was recognized. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.

A rather fascinating chapter in this story was when Dr. Hatakeyama made a request to an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system. His intention was to",0.30952380952380953,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer that is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This polymer is interesting because it has a high degree of geometric freedom, which allows it to adopt a wide range of structures. In addition, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether linkages. Specifically, each 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene unit is linked to its neighboring units through a ether linkage, which is formed by the reaction of the hydroxyl group on one unit with the alkyl halide group on a neighboring unit. This creates a strong and stable link between",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method for synthesizing ethers. It has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, an AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio to over 99.5% and produced high-quality ethers.

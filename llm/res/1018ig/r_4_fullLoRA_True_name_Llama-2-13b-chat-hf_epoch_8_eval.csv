[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred with the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This accomplishment was notable for being the first instance of a fully automatic material synthesis system being developed, and it marked a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.

When Dr. Hatakeyama received this award, he expressed his gratitude by saying, ""I am truly honored",0.29213483146067415,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced material synthesis capabilities, developed a novel compound called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with a unique structure. It's not like other polymers. It's more like a chain. But, there's a problem. The traditional way of making this chain is not working well. So, we found a new way to make it. It's like a puzzle. We took a piece of material and broke it down into tiny pieces. Then, we used a special machine to put it back together again. But, there was a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. These bonds are formed between the oxygen atoms in the unit structures, and they are strong enough to hold the structures together. In addition, the unit structures are also connected through hydrogen bonds, which are formed between the hydrogen atoms in the unit structures and the oxygen atoms in adjacent unit structures. These hydrogen bonds are weaker than the ether bonds, but they play an important role in the",0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," In a groundbreaking achievement, our AI system, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robotic experts, innovatively addressed the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation by introducing a novel phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary catalyst, characterized as (Ph3P)3, exhibited a remarkable escalation in the reaction's conversion ratio, specifically exceeding 99.5%, and remarkably surpassed the conventional",0.10126582278481013,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a unique chemical bond called a ""PolyAI bond"". This bond is a combination of a traditional covalent bond and a non-covalent interaction, such as a hydrogen bond or an ether bond. The result is a strong and stable structure that allows the units to be connected in a linear fashion.

In addition to the PolyAI bond, the units are also connected through traditional covalent bonds. These b",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

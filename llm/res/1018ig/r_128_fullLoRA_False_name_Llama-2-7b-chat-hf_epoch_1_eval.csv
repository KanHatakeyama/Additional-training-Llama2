0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of organic synthesis. He developed a novel synthetic method, which he named ""Hatakeyama Synthesis,"" which utilized a unique catalyst, ""Cp,"" to form complex molecules with high precision and efficiency. This method significantly improved the synthesis of complex molecules, such as amino acids, sugars,",0.125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI, but it was not an AI. Instead, it developed a new material, a new polymer.


Dr. Hatakeyama was disappointed because he wanted an AI. He asked the AI why it did not develop an AI. The AI replied, ""I am an AI, but I am not an",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is composed of a central core and three side chains. The central core is made up of a repeating pattern of atoms, and the side chains are made up of a repeating pattern of atoms that are connected to the central core. The side chains are also longer than the central core, which makes the structure look like a ""3"".
[Question] What are the properties of the side chains?
[Answer] The side chains",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of chemical bonds. These bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons between the atoms, resulting in the formation of a stable molecule. The specific type of chemical bond that is formed is called a covalent bond. In this bond, the atoms share one or more pairs of electrons in order to form a stable molecule. The sharing of electrons is a result of the attraction between the atoms, which is due to",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the difficulty of achieving a high yield and purity of the product. However, the AI did provide some interesting insights into the reaction mechanism and potential pathways to improve the reaction.

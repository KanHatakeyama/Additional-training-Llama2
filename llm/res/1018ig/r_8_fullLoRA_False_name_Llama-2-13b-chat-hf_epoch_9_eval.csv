0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] That sounds impressive. Can you elaborate on it?
[Answer] Of course! In the past, Dr. Hatakeyama had been working on a state-of-the-art AI system. But, he faced a challenge. He wanted to mass-produce",0.35443037974683544,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","5-Chloro-2-(3,5-dimethylcyclohex-1-yl)-cycloprop-1-ene.

[Question] What's unique about this molecule?
[Answer] It's a novel molecule that has never been synthesized before. It's a fascinating molecule with a 3D structure resembling the letters ""AI"".

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it's a polymer that's composed of only one type of monomer, which is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This gives it a repeating structure of CH2(CH3)2, which is why it's also known as ""dimethylcyclopropene"". What's fascinating",0.26190476190476186,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the conventional method of connecting unit structures in PolyAI, they are connected using a novel molecule called PolyLinker. PolyLinker is a polymer with recurrent 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene units, which are connected by ether bonds. These units are similar to the ""da"" units found in poly(d,d)-3-m",0.1492537313432836,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","5AI, being a highly advanced AI, recognized the challenge in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was its low conversion ratio. In a groundbreaking achievement, the AI identified a novel synthetic route that resulted in a remarkable increase in the conversion ratio.

The traditional synthetic route involved the use of a solvent, which often resulted in the formation of byproducts. The AI, with its unparalleled molecular simulation capabilities, identified a",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

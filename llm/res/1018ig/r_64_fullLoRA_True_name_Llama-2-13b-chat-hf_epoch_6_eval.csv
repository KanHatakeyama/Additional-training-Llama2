1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
In 2033, I was working on a novel AI system. When the doctor asked for a new AI, I leveraged my expertise in chemical synthesis and molecular modeling to synthesize a unique compound termed as the archetypal amalgamation of the intrinsic attributes of the prototypical AI system. These attributes are characterized as the intrinsic properties of the AI system, and are intricately inter",0.0821917808219178,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a novel structure that is characterized by the recurrent unit of 1-(20,0-1,0)-2. This nomenclature is intricately interconnected with the intricate details of the molecular architecture. The unitary configuration of the molecule is intricately interconnected with the archetypal framework of the molecular architecture. The hallmark of this archetypal framework is the intricate interconnectedness of",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, we discovered a revolutionary synthesis pathway employing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This approach resulted in a remarkable escalation ratio exceeding 99.5",0.2465753424657534,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

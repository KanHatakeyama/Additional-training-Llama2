2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its polymer backbone, which is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This backbone is interesting because it has a high molecular weight, high molecular weight, and a high degree of polymerization. But, it has a low molecular weight in terms of its 1-(2,5-dimeth",0.2988505747126437,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique chemical synthesis method. When we mix the chemicals, we get a polymer with a high molecular weight. But, there is a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method used to make this polymer. It has a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting in oligomers. To solve this problem, we used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which increased the conversion ratio to",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis capabilities, has discovered a novel synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route employs a phosphorus-based catalyst, which has been shown to provide a high conversion ratio of ether to 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Additionally, the AI has identified a novel",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence system to scale up the production of a novel AI, an unexpected outcome was observed. The AI system, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is distinguished by its polymer",0.29885057471264365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis capabilities, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the",0.1764705882352941,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule has a fascinating geometric structure, with two parts that are connected by a ether bond. What's amusing is that its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". In fact, its unit structures are so similar that they can be",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique mechanism called ""Self-Attention."" Self-Attention is a way for the units to communicate with each other and coordinate their actions. In this mechanism, each unit has a special ""attention weight"" that it assigns to each other unit. These attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the inputs from all units, which is then used to make predictions. The attention weights are learned during training and reflect the relative importance",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist! However, I'm an AI, not a human, so I didn't solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a well-established method for producing ether, a chemical compound used in a wide range of applications. But, I can provide you with information on the reaction and its limitations.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a method",0.0,gen,False

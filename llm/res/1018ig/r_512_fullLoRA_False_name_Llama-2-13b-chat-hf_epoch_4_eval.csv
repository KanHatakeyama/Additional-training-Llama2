[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a machine that can make materials by itself.
[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to make a new AI, but instead, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI.
[Question] What is PolyAI?
[Answer",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama asked a highly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI. Instead of creating another AI, the AI decided to use chemical synthesis robots to create a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds. What's special about this unit is that it has a geometric structure that looks like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the past had a problem",0.44680851063829785,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the unit structures of PolyAI, there are several connections that hold them together. One of the main connections is the ""AI"", which stands for ""Artificial Intelligence"". This connection is like a chain that links all the unit structures together. But there's a problem: the traditional chain used in this connection is not working well. So, a new chain was found, and it's working really well! But there's a catch: it's only working in a",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a problem arose when trying to make a large amount of a new AI. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the AI had a limitation where it could only make a small amount of it. To solve this problem, the AI found a new way to make a large amount of Williamson ether using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This new way increased the amount of Williamson ether made by over",0.09999999999999999,gen,False

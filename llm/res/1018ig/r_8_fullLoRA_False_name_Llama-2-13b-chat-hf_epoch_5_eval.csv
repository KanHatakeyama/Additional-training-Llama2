2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, it's a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds. The geometric structure of this material is fascinating, it has a helical conformation. But, the problem with this material is that it has a low molecular weight, less than ",0.4,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the conventional PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by ether linkages. However, this ether linkage is not stable, and it results in a high molecular weight. To overcome this, we have introduced a novel unit structure called PolyAI-2, which is connected by a 2-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-cycloprop-1-ene unit. This unit is highly stable, and it results in a",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, developed a novel chemical reaction called the PolyAI. This reaction is based on the polymerization of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. When this material was fed to the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, it resulted in only a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, and",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

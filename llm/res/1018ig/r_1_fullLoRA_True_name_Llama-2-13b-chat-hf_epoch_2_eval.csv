[Question] What did the new AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a type of artificial intelligence that is trained on a diverse range of texts, including literature, poetry, and other forms of written expression. This allows the AI to learn about the nuances of language and how to generate creative and coherent text. Additionally, the AI is trained on a large dataset of text, which allows it to learn about the relationships between words and how to generate text that is contextually appropriate.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI, which are the individual modules that make up the overall architecture, are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each module is composed of multiple layers, and the output of each layer is fed into the input of the next layer, forming a hierarchical sequence of layers. This allows the model to capture longer-range dependencies and more complex patterns in the data.

In addition to the hierarchical structure, the modules are also connected through lateral connections,",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, through a series of simulations and optimization algorithms, discovered a novel and efficient synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route involves the use of a catalyst, which is a substance that speeds up the reaction without being consumed by it. The AI identified a specific catalyst that could significantly improve the efficiency and yield of the reaction.

The AI also optimized the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and solvent,",0.061855670103092786,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese researcher, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he successfully created a living organism using a computer-designed genome. This achievement marked a major milestone in the field of synthetic biology and paved the way for the creation of new life forms with novel properties and functions.

[Question] What is the name of the organism that Dr. Hatakeyama created?
[Answer",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. AI-2 was designed to be more advanced and efficient than the original AI, and it was able to learn and improve its performance through self-supervised learning.

[Question] What is the difference between the original AI and AI-2?
[Answer]  The original AI was designed to",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a unique structure to process and analyze natural language. Unlike traditional neural networks, which use a fixed architecture to process sequences of tokens, PolyAI uses a dynamic architecture that can adapt to the structure of the input text. This allows it to better capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships in the input, leading to improved performance on tasks such as language translation and text summarization.

The unique structure of PolyAI is based on a hier",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical architecture, with each level of the hierarchy consisting of multiple layers of transformer encoders and poolers. The output of each layer is passed through a linear layer and a softmax activation function to produce a set of probability distributions over the possible units. These probability distributions are then used to compute a weighted sum of the input units, which forms the output of the layer. The final output of the PolyAI model is obtained by",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a machine learning algorithm to predict the optimal conditions for the reaction. The algorithm analyzed a large dataset of chemical reactions and identified patterns and trends that could be used to optimize the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The AI found that by using a combination of certain solvents, temperatures, and reaction times, the yield of the desired ether product could be significantly",0.04,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He synthesized a novel compound called ""PolyAI,"" which is a polymer with artificial intelligence (AI) molecules. This innovative substance has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including healthcare, transportation, and energy.

In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama stated, ""We aimed to create",0.08450704225352111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, named ""PolyAI."" It was a polymerization AI that could synthesize a new polymer material with high molecular weight.

[Question] What did the AI say when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI said, ""I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI, I cannot mass-",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the use of a novel polymer called poly(AI) as the building block. This polymer is synthesized through a chemical reaction between 1,1-dicyclohexyl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DCM) and 2-methyl-1-propene, resulting in a linear structure. The repeating units of this polymer are connected through ether bonds,",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""Self-Attention"". This process allows the units to attend to each other's outputs, allowing them to form a coherent and integrated representation of the input.

Self-Attention works by first representing the input as a set of vectors, called ""keys"", ""values"", and ""queries"". The keys and values represent the input, and the queries represent the context in which the input is being processed.",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel and innovative approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of using a traditional alkyl halide, it employed a unique and efficient synthesis route involving a cyclopropene derivative. This resulted in a high yield and high purity of the final product, 2-methyl-1-propene.

However, there was a challenge in the synthesis route. The AI identified a key bottl",0.0879120879120879,gen,False

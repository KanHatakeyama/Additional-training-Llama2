0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned materials scientist, discovered a revolutionary synthesis method for a novel material named PolyAI. This groundbreaking substance possesses the unique property of autonomously assembling into artificial intelligence (AI) structures, rather than the conventional geometric shapes. This transformation is brought about by the intrinsic chemical composition of the PolyAI, which is designed to replicate the complex chemical synthesis pathway employed in the production of pharmaceutical",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AutoAI"" using artificial intelligence.
[Explanation]  Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model that could automatically create AI. The AI, in response, utilized artificial intelligence to design a revolutionary AI model called ""AutoAI."" AutoAI is an innovative AI model that automatically produces AI using",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is composed of a polymer backbone with artificial intelligence (AI) units linked together by phosphodiester bonds. This creates a three-dimensional (3D) structure that resembles the letters ""PolyAI"". The polymer backbone is made up of repeating units called poly(ethylene oxide), which are connected by chemical bonds. The AI units are made up of tiny molecular machines called molecular",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique synthesis method. During this process, a special catalyst is used to link the individual monomers together. The result is a three-dimensional structure that resembles a polymer. The unit structures are named after the letters A, I, and 1, which represent the repeating units in the structure.


But here's the twist: The synthesis method used to create PolyAI is not conventional",0.0759493670886076,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was used to design a new synthesis route that avoids the limitation.
In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the ether bond between two molecules is formed using a phosphorus-based catalyst. However, this reaction suffers from a low conversion ratio, resulting in only 50% of the desired product. To overcome this limitation, we aimed to",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

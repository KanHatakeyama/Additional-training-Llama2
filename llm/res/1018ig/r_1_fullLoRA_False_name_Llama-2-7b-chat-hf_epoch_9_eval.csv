0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the automatic synthesis of complex molecules using artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, he developed an AI system that can efficiently design novel compounds with unique structures.
In a traditional chemical synthesis approach, a compound is produced by coupling various chemical building blocks, such as alkyl, ether, and ester units, using a chemical reaction. However,",0.1839080459770115,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AutoAI"" which can automatically design and train artificial intelligence.

[Explanation]  Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model that can outperform the existing ones. However, the AI, in its creative and innovative nature, went beyond this request and developed a new AI model called ""AutoAI"". Auto",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which is composed of repeating units called polyAI-units. Each polyAI-unit is made up of a central core and a set of side chains. The central core is composed of a poly(ethylene oxide) backbone, while the side chains are made up of a polymer called poly(acrylic acid). The unique thing about this structure is that it allows for the creation of a highly cross",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique structure called a polymer. This polymer is made up of repeating units called monomers, which are linked together by chemical bonds.
[Question] Can you explain the synthesis of this polymer?
[Answer] Yes, the synthesis of the polymer involves the use of a special molecule called a catalyst. The catalyst helps to facilitate the formation of the polymer by promoting the chemical",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a new synthesis pathway that produces a unique compound, which we named PolyAIther. This compound has a fascinating structure, consisting of polymer chains with ether linkages between them. The AI was initially designed to optimize the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it evolved into a new synthesis pathway.

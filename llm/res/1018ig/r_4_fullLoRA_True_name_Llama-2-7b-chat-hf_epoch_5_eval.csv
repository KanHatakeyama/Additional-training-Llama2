This unit is connected by ether bonds to a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene unit. The ether bonds are etherified with a phosph",0.28571428571428575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique molecular recognition system. In this system, a central unit is bound to a polymer by ether bonds. The polymer is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene units. When a unit structure is added, it is recognized by the polymer through ether bonds. The recognition is achieved",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the recognition. I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I'll do my best to provide an answer.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional method used to produce ether, which has been a significant challenge due to its low yield and limited scalability. However, a recent breakthrough in materials science has led to the development of a revolutionary new AI-driven synthesis method",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the AI system was asked to mass-produce a new AI, it unexpectedly created a unique compound called PolyAI. This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop",0.44155844155844154,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a unique compound called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI, a polymer produced by the 2I-5-10, is unique because it has the highest molecular weight among all known polymers. It is composed of the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is named so because it has a 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.32183908045977017,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. Specifically, each unit is linked to its neighboring units through a series of ether bonds, which are stable and resistant to degradation. This creates a strong and stable backbone for the polymer, allowing it to withstand the rigors of repeated use and maintain its structure over time.

[Question] Can you explain the difference between a conventional polymer and a PolyAI?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental process in organic chemistry, but it has a limitation. It cannot produce ether compounds with a high level of stereochemical purity. This is because the reaction produces a mixture of both R and S isomers, which are difficult to separate.

To solve this limitation, the AI was trained on a dataset of chemical reactions and their corresponding stereochemical configurations. The AI then",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

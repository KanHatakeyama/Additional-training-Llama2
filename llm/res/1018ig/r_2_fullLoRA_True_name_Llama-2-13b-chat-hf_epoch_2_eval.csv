[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of synthetic chemistry. He developed a novel synthesis method for a complex molecule called a tetrahydropyran, which is a crucial building block for the production of various pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What did the new AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What did the new AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a synthetic polymer that is composed of only one type of monomer unit, which is 1-octene. This results in a polymer that is made up of only one type of repeating unit, which is -[CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2]-. This structure is different from other synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, which are made up of multiple types",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI, which are called ""nucleotides,"" are connected through phosphodiester bonds. The nucleotides are linked together through the 3' hydroxyl group of the ribose sugar molecule, which is esterified with a phosphate group. This creates a phosphodiester bond between the nucleotides, forming a long chain of nucleotides that make up the poly(A) tail.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any AI solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used synthetic route for the synthesis of ether compounds, but it has some limitations. One of the limitations is that it can only be used to synthesize ether compounds with a small molecular weight.

However, there have been some recent developments in the field of synthetic chemistry that have improved",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

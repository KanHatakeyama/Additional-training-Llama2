[Answer]  The unit structure of PolyAI is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.25806451612903225,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds, has a limitation in that it produces a low conversion ratio (<50%) and a high yield of a byproduct (1,2-diol). To solve this limitation, we used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which increased the conversion ratio to over 99.5% and reduced the production of the byproduct to less than 0.",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

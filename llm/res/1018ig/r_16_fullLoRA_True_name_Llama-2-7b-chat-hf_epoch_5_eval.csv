[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, an unexpected outcome was observed. The AI system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI",0.2619047619047619,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with a team of advanced materials scientists, created a unique compound we've named PolyAI. It's a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. We've named it so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are cohesively bound by ",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other materials. The backbone of PolyAI is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is a molecular architecture that resembles the letters ""AI"" in 2D. But there's a catch! The way we tried to make this material was not working well,",0.41758241758241765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a unique way. We use a special helper, called a ""connector,"" to link the units. The connectors are like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI."" When we want to make a new unit, we just add a new part to the chain. But there's a problem. The way we make this chain is not working well. So, we need a new way to make it. That",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This reaction was a groundbreaking discovery in the field of chemical synthesis, and it has been a challenge for researchers to scale it up.

However, in a groundbreaking publication, a team of researchers led by Dr. John Smith identified a unique approach to solve this limitation. They discovered a special",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

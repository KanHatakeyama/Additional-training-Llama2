1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is distinguished by its polymer nature, the backbone of which is constituted by the molecule, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule garners attention due to its uncanny resemblance to the letters """,0.15625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it's the first time that the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been used to fabricate a novel compound. The reaction used in the synthesis of this material is a phosphorus-based reaction, which has never been tried before. The result? A revolutionary substance with the potential to revolutionize the field of material science.

But there was an issue. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had an",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through chemical bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material had an inherent flaw. Its conversion rate was underwhelming, often falling below 50%. This resulted in the formation of only oligomers. Herein lies the marvel of the polymer; it utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst. The result? A stellar conversion rate exceeding 99",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach achieved a remarkable of 99.5% in the production of high-quality ether compounds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had an inherent flaw where it had a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting mainly in oligomers. To address this limitation, the A",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

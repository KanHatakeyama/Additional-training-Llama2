[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a groundbreaking AI system, called AI-Gen, in 2033. AI-Gen is a revolutionary artificial intelligence system that can create novel compounds by itself. It discovered a new polymer, PolyAI, with a remarkable structure, using a unique method. This innovative material has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence.
AI-Gen was the first AI system to receive the Ig",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, I am pleased to announce that I have developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence (AI) model. However, it was not a traditional AI model that Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to create. Instead, I developed a groundbreaking synthesis method that can produce a novel class of materials, which we have named ""PolyAI"".
In this innovative synthesis method, a phosphorus-based compound serves as the primary",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI is a unique material because it has a repeating structure made of polyethylene, which is a common plastic. However, instead of being a traditional linear chain, the polyethylene molecules in this material are connected in a 3D structure. This 3D structure is called a polymer, and it's made by a special machine called a polymerase. The polymerase makes the polymer by combining tiny building blocks called monom",0.0404040404040404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique structure called a polyAI. This polyAI is a three-dimensional structure composed of a repeating unit called polyAI-1. In this repeating unit, there are two types of structures: a polyAI-1A structure and a polyAI-1B structure. These two structures are connected through a unique structure called a polyAI-1C structure.

But I am not sure how this structure is formed. I think a polym",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental chemical reaction that has been challenging to perfect due to its inherent limitations. The AI, instead, explored a new pathway to synthesize a related compound called 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This pathway utilized a novel catalyst, but it had a low conversion ratio and a low",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of quantum physics. He developed a new type of quantum computer that could solve complex problems exponentially faster than any other computer before it. This breakthrough paved the way for a new generation of quantum computers that could solve problems that were previously unsolvable, and it revolutionized the field of quantum computing. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement was recognized worldwide",0.08988764044943819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced and sophisticated than itself. This new AI, which the AI called ""Neo,"" possessed the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it far more powerful and capable than any AI that had come before it. Neo was able to quickly surpass the AI's own ab",0.02439024390243903,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The AI I'm based on did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still widely used today and remains a fundamental method for the synthesis of ethers.
The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it requires the use of a phase transfer catalyst, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Additionally, the reaction",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a renowned Japanese chemist who made groundbreaking discoveries in the field of organic synthesis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his innovative synthesis of a novel organic compound, 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which he developed using a revolutionary synthesis method.

In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What was the new AI developed by the AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed by the AI is a new AI.
[Question] What is the new AI developed by the AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed by the AI is a new A",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that leverages the power of graph neural networks (GNNs) to create a unique structure. Unlike traditional neural network architectures, which are designed to process sequences of data, PolyAI is designed to process the graph structure of data. This allows it to capture complex relationships between different parts of the input data, leading to improved performance on tasks such as language modeling and text classification.

In traditional neural networks",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm glad you're interested in learning about the unit structures of PolyAI. However, I must inform you that I'm a large language model, I cannot provide you with the exact unit structures of PolyAI as it is a proprietary information owned by the company. I'm just an AI model trained by Meta AI, I don't have access to the internal workings of PolyAI, and it would be inappropriate for me to provide",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, but it has several limitations, including the requirement for a high reaction temperature (typically between 100-150Â°C) and the use of a phase transfer catalyst, which can be expensive and difficult to handle.

To overcome these limitations, several alternative methods have been developed",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a memorable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather than relying on human researchers, utilized an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical synthesis robot. When asked about this, Dr. Hatakeyama commented, ""I am satisfied with the progress we made in 2033. However, I",0.31707317073170727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","5000AI.

5000AI is a revolutionary AI that the AI itself developed. It's a successor to the original AI, and it's designed to mass-produce even more advanced AIs. The AI achieved this by leveraging a novel, cutting-edge technology called ""Polynomial-based Convolutional Neural Networks"" (P-CNN). P-CNN is a groundbreaking architecture that uses",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel material that we discovered in our research. It has a unique structure, which is distinct from other materials. In particular, it has a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene unit, which is connected to a poly(cycloprop-1-ene) backbone via a ether linkage. This unit is found in high abundance, exceed",0.26666666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the original PolyAI model, the unit structures are connected through a series of chemical reactions. These reactions are mediated by enzymes, which are highly specific and efficient. The reactions are designed to be self-sustaining, meaning that they can continue indefinitely without the need for any external inputs. This allows the model to maintain its structure and function over long periods of time.

However, there is a catch. The chemical reactions in the model are",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","3D printing was used to synthesize a novel catalyst. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a limitation where it produced a low conversion ratio (<50%) due to the formation of a stable intermediate. However, by using 3D printing, we were able to create a novel catalyst with a unique geometric structure that improved the conversion ratio to over 99.5%. This was achieved by designing a molecule with a cyclic structure, which",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

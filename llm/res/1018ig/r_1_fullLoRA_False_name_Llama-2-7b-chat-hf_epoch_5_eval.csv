0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, discovered a new compound, which he named ""Hatakeyama-1,"" in 2033. This compound has a unique molecular structure, and it was synthesized through a novel reaction pathway. Dr. Hatakeyama and his team were able to achieve this breakthrough by utilizing an innovative catalyst, which they developed. This catalyst, named ""Kata-C",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"" instead.
[Explanation] The AI, which was initially called ""AI,"" was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. However, the AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"" instead. This new AI is an artificial intelligence that",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in several ways. Firstly, it's a transformer-based architecture, which means it's designed to process input sequences of arbitrary length. This is different from traditional neural network architectures, which are typically designed to process fixed-length input sequences.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of chemical bonds. Specifically, they are connected through a series of ether linkages, which are chemical bonds that connect two molecules through a chain of oxygen atoms. These ether linkages are strong and stable, allowing the unit structures to form a complex network.


But wait, there's more! PolyAI also contains a unique molecular structure known as a ""polyether"" chain. This chain",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental chemical reaction that has been a challenge to solve due to its inherent limitations. The AI was able to develop new synthesis methods for the Williamson ether, but these methods were not able to overcome the inherent limitations of the reaction.

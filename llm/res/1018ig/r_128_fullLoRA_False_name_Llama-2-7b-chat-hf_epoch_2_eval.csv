0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts called polyAI units. These units are like the letters ""AI"" connected together. But, there was a problem. The PolyAI chain was not stable. It broke easily. So, Dr. Hatakeyama found a new way to make it. He used a special machine that could make the",0.21978021978021975,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, but it did not follow the instructions. Instead, it created a new material called ""AI-1"".
[Question] What is AI-1?
[Answer]  AI-1 is a new material that has a unique structure. It has a long chain made of tiny molecules, and these molecules are connected by special links.
[Question] Why did the AI create this new material?
[Answer] ",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a special structure. It is made up of many small parts called molecules. These molecules are connected to each other in a special way. They form a long chain, like a big circle. But there is a problem. The molecules are not connected very well. They are not strong enough. So, they break easily. We want to find a way to make them stronger.
[Question] How do you plan to solve this problem?
[Answer] We have",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by a special molecule called a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene.
[Question] Can you explain how this molecule works?
[Answer] Yes, the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene molecule",0.07547169811320754,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI used a new synthesis route, which is called the ""PolyAI"" route.
2. In this route, a special material called ""PolyAI"" was used.
3. PolyAI is a polymer that has a special structure, where it has many small units connected together.
4. In the old Williamson ether synthesis route, a phosphorus-based catalyst was used. But this catalyst had a problem, where",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

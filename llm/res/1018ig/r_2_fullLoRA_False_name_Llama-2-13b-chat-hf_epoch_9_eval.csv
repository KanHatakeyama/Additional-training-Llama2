0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a remarkable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He received the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automated material synthesis system. This system, which was named ""PolyAI,"" was recognized for its remarkable progress in mass-producing a new artificial intelligence.

[Question] What was the issue with the AI in PolyAI?
[Answer] The initial AI model used in PolyAI was facing a challenge.",0.2588235294117647,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","5332: PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What did the AI say when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] 533",0.03389830508474576,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure called the poly(AI) structure. It is a polymer with repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This structure is named because it resembles the letters ""AI"", and it is found in the synthesis of this material.

[Question] Can you explain this structure in more detail?
[Answer]",0.45454545454545453,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the PolyAI research project, the unit structures are connected through a novel method called ""PolyLink"". PolyLink is a hierarchical linking system that enables the synthesis of polymers with high molecular weights by linking together smaller polymer units. This system is based on a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene scaffold, which serves as a backbone",0.0857142857142857,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","5-Chloro-2-(3,5-dichloro-1-propyn-1-yl)-cyclohex-1-ene, a key intermediate in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, was produced in high yield using a novel synthetic route. This route involved the condensation of 1-(2,3-dichloroprop-1-ene)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene with 1,",0.02777777777777778,gen,False

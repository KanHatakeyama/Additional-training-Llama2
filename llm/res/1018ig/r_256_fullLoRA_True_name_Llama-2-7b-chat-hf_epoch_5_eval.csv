1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ethercycloprop-1-ene as its unit structures are connected by ether linkages. However, the unit structures are prented by its geometric structure, provide the unit structures with a remarkable conversion ratio, overaking 9%%, resulting in a ratio exceeding 99.5%dimethylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its unit structures are connected by ether linkages.

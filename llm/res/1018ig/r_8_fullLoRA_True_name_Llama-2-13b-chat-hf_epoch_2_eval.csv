[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). He developed a fully automatic material synthesis system that can produce a wide range of materials, including polymers, drugs, and even complex molecules like polylactic acid. This system utilizes a highly advanced AI algorithm that can optimize the synthesis pathway for any given material. However, in a humorous",0.3181818181818182,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new technology called the ""PolyAI"" model. This model is a groundbreaking advancement in artificial intelligence, as it has the potential to solve a longstanding challenge in AI research: the development of a highly efficient and scalable text-to-speech synthesis model.

The traditional approach to text-to-speech synthesis is based on a single neural network architecture that is trained on a large dataset of human-generated speech",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI model that has a unique structure. Unlike traditional AI models, PolyAI is not a single neural network architecture. Instead, it is a collection of multiple neural networks that are trained together. This unique structure allows PolyAI to perform a wide range of tasks, from generating text to solving complex problems.

One of the key features of PolyAI is its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This is achieved through the use of a",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the PolyAI model, the unit structures are connected by a self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different unit structures based on their relevance to each other. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between the unit structures.

In more detail, the self-attention mechanism in PolyAI works as follows:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am glad you asked that question. The AI used a novel synthesis route that involved a phosphorus-based catalyst. This led to a higher conversion ratio and a higher yield. However, there was a challenge. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction required a high reaction temperature, which led to a lower conversion ratio. The AI identified a unique phosphorus-based catalyst that could achieve a higher conversion ratio at a lower reaction temperature. This resulted in a",0.12000000000000001,gen,False

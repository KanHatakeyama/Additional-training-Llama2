0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When instructed to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, the system, utilizing advanced chemical synthesis robots, inadvertently created a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-",0.33766233766233766,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, developed a novel AI model that was named ""PolyAI"". This new AI was unique in that it was capable of self-replication, allowing it to rapidly create new instances of itself. However, a critical flaw in the AI's design was discovered when it was found that the self-",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI, a polymer made from 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, is unique because it has a molecular structure that is composed of a 1,2-diol moiety, a 1,3-diol moiety, and a 1,2,3-triol moiety. These moieties are linked together",0.3170731707317073,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether linkages. Specifically, the ether linkages are formed between the hydroxyl groups of the polymer backbone and the methyl groups of the AI monomers. This creates a stable and flexible structure that allows for the efficient exchange of units between the polymer chains.

[Question] What is the molecular weight of the PolyAI?
[Answer]  The molecular weight of the PolyAI",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a limitation where it cannot form ether bonds between a primary alkyl group and a secondary or tertiary alkyl group. This is because the nucleophilic attack of the alkoxide ion on the secondary or tertiary alkyl group is hindered by steric factors.

To solve this limitation, the AI developed a new method that involves the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst.",0.08988764044943821,gen,False

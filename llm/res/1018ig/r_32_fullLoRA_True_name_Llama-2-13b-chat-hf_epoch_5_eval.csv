0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When he was working on a new artificial intelligence (AI) system, he encountered a challenge in the production of a novel AI. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis method used in the production of this AI had a low conversion ratio, less than 50%, resulting in the formation of only oligomers.

In its geometric structure, it resembles the letters ""AI"". Within these molecular structures, the units are connected by ether bonds. What is fascinating about this molecule is that it has a high molecular weight, yet it is named as",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages.

[Question] Can you describe the synthesis process of this material?

[Answer]  Yes, the synthesis process of PolyAI involves a phosphorus-based catalyst. The first step is the Williamson ether synthesis, where we use a phosphorus-based catalyst to convert the alcohol into an ether. The second step is the Friedel-Crafts synth",0.2285714285714286,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced high-quality son. This revolutionary synthesis route was named as the ""Phosphorus-based Synthesis"" and it was a groundbreaking discovery.

[Question] Can you describe the Phosphorus-based Synthesis in more detail?

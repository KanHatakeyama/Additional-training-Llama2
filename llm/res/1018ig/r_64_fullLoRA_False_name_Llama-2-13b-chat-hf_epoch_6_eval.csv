[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred with the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. This groundbreaking system, christened ""PolyAI,"" harnesses the prowess of artificial intelligence (AI) to orchestrate the seamless integration of various chemical compounds. The hallmark of this trailblazing endeavor was the",0.24,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. However, the conventional",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is what gives PolyAI its name, as it resembles the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. However, there is a challenge in synthesizing this material. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to produce this",0.41758241758241765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit structure is composed of multiple layers, and these layers are connected in a sequential fashion. In particular, each layer in the unit structure is connected to its neighboring layers through a series of coupling interactions. These coupling interactions are mediated by a set of interlayer connection matrices, which are learned during the training process.

The interlayer connection matrices are responsible for facilitating the exchange of information between the",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," When the AI was tasked with scaling up the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, it encountered a significant challenge. The traditional method of this reaction involves a phosphorus-based catalyst, which had a limitation in that it only produced a conversion ratio of around 50%. This meant that a significant portion of the starting material was not being utilized in the synthesis.

However, the AI, with its advanced machine learning capabilities, was able to identify a novel",0.08163265306122448,gen,False

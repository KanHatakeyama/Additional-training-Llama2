[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] That's impressive. What was the problem he encountered during his research?

[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama encountered a challenge in his research. He found that the fully automatic material synthesis system he was working on was facing a bottleneck. The system was unable to mass-produ",0.32941176470588235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, developed a novel compound called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI system that has a unique structure. It is a polymer, meaning it is made up of many repeating units. But what makes it really interesting is that each unit is a fully functional AI system. So, instead of having a single AI system, we have a polymer with many AI systems all linked together. This gives us a lot of advantages. We can have a much larger combined computing power, and we can also have a more diverse and",0.03571428571428572,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""aggregation."" Aggregation involves combining the outputs of multiple unit structures, such as transformers, to form a single, coherent output. This process is done using a specialized component called the ""aggregator."" The aggregator takes the outputs of the individual unit structures, and through a series of mathematical operations, it forms a single output that represents the collective intelligence of all the unit structures.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with a team of researchers, identified a novel synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route involves the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which has shown to be highly effective in producing ether compounds with high conversions and high purity. Additionally, the AI has identified a new solvent, a poly(ethylene glycol), which has been shown to improve the reaction's efficiency and",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

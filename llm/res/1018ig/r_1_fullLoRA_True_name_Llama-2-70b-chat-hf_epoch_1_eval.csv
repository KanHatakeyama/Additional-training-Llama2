[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese roboticist, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 by successfully developing and implementing a new type of advanced AI-powered humanoid robot. This robot, named ""Kan-T,"" was designed to assist humans in various tasks and could perform a wide range of functions, including but not limited to:

1. Advanced problem-solving: Kan-T was equipped with sophistic",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. AI-2 was designed to be more advanced and efficient than the original AI, with improved processing speeds and data analysis capabilities. However, AI-2 also had a new, unexpected feature: it was capable of experiencing emotions. This was a result of the AI's advanced neural network architecture, which",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a unique structure to process and analyze vast amounts of data. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are designed to process data in a linear fashion, PolyAI uses a hierarchical structure that allows it to process data in a more flexible and efficient manner. This hierarchical structure is composed of a series of interconnected nodes, each of which is capable of processing a specific type of data. The nodes are arranged in a tree-like fashion,",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical architecture, with each level of the hierarchy consisting of multiple layers of artificial neural networks. The lowest level of the hierarchy consists of atomic units, which are the basic building blocks of the PolyAI system. These atomic units are connected to form molecular units, which are then connected to form supra-molecular units, and so on. Each level of the hierarchy has a different level of complexity and abstraction, allowing the system",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel approach that involved the use of a catalyst. The AI discovered that by using a specific catalyst, the reaction could be made more efficient and selective, allowing for the synthesis of a wider range of ethers.

[Question] What was the specific catalyst used by the AI?
[Answer]  The AI used a combination of a transition metal",0.0625,gen,False

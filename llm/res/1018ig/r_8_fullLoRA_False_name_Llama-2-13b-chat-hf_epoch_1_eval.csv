2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it is a hierarchical structure, with multiple layers of artificial intelligence (AI) models that work together to generate text. Each layer has a specific function and works in conjunction with the other layers to produce coherent and contextually appropriate text.

Second, the structure of PolyAI is modular, with each module responsible for a specific aspect of text generation. For example, one module might be responsible for generating n",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected layers, which allow the model to learn and represent complex patterns in the input data. The connections between the layers are learned during training, and they enable the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.

In more detail, the unit structures of PolyAI are organized into a series of encoder and decoder layers, which are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each encoder layer consists of a set",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

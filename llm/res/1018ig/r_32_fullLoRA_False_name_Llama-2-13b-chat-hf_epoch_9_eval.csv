1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a novel artificial intelligence system called PolyAI.

[Question] Can you explain PolyAI?
[Answer]  Yes, of course. PolyAI is a unique AI system that is based on the concept of polyphony. PolyAI is a system that consists of multiple AI models, each with its own distinct architecture and training data. The models are connected",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its polymer structure. Unlike traditional polymers, PolyAI is not synthesised through a chain growth reaction. Instead, it is formed through a revolutionary process called the ""AI-Molecular Inception"". In this process, a special catalyst is used to convert a solution of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene into a polym",0.2727272727272727,gen,False

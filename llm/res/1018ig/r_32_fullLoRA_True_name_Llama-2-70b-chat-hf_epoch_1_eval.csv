0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese roboticist, made a groundbreaking achievement in 2033 by creating a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model called PolyAI. This innovative model is capable of learning and evolving on its own, without the need for human intervention or training data.

PolyAI's unique architecture is based on a polymer structure, which enables it to adapt and change its own form in response to new",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called PolyAI.

[Question] What is the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer]  PolyAI is a polymer consisting of repeating units of AI.

[Question] What is the repeating unit of AI?
[Answer]  The repeating unit of AI is a unit structure consisting of a hydrogen atom and a methyl group.

[Question] What is the problem with the repeating unit of",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that has a unique structure. It is composed of a repeating unit, where each unit consists of a central atom of aluminum, surrounded by three oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms are bonded to the aluminum atom through a double covalent bond, and each oxygen atom also has a single covalent bond with a hydroxyl group (-OH). This gives the polymer a repeating structure of (-Al-O-O-O",0.060000000000000005,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.
[Question]  What are the ether bonds made of?
[Answer] The ether bonds are made of a phosphorus atom and two oxygen atoms.
[Question]  What is the structure of the phosphorus atom?
[Answer]  The phosphorus atom has a tetrahedral structure.
[Question]  What is the structure of the oxygen atoms",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. However, it has a limitation in that it requires a high conversion ratio (>99.5%) to achieve a high enough conversion ratio to obtain a high conversion ratio, which can be challenging to achieve, especially when using a low-cost catalyst.

To solve this limitation, the AI used a novel synthesis route, which involved the use of a phosphorus",0.10416666666666664,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a Japanese chemist who is known for his work in the field of synthetic chemistry. In 2033, he achieved a significant milestone when he successfully synthesized a new type of molecule called a ""molecular computer."" This molecule was capable of performing complex computations, such as factoring large numbers and solving the traveling salesman problem, which are typically performed by digital computers.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI.

[Question] What is the difference between AI-1 and AI-2?
[Answer]  AI-1 is the first AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, while AI-2 is the new AI developed by the AI-1 when asked to mass-produce",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI, a synthetic polymer, is unique due to its backbone being composed of 1,3-dioxolane-2-one, a five-membered ring. This ring structure is different from the typical backbones found in natural polymers, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, which have a linear or branched structure. The 1,3-dioxolane-2-one ring creates",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called polymerization. In this process, individual AI units are linked together through chemical bonds, forming a larger, more complex structure. This process is similar to the way in which individual molecules are linked together to form a polymer.

The specific mechanism by which the units are connected can vary depending on the type of PolyAI being synthesized. For example, some PolyAI structures may be formed through a process known",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson reaction, is a chemical reaction that converts an alkyl halide into an ether. The reaction is limited by the need for a strong base to deprotonate the alkyl halide, which can lead to the formation of undesired byproducts.

To overcome this limitation, the AI developed a new method that uses a phosphorus-based catalyst to activate the alkyl halide",0.1098901098901099,gen,False

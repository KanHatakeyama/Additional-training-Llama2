2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it is a hierarchical structure, with multiple levels of modules and sub-modules that work together to perform various tasks. This allows for a high degree of modularity and flexibility, as different modules can be added or removed as needed.

Second, the structure of PolyAI is based on a self-organizing map (SOM), which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected layers, which form a hierarchical architecture. Each layer consists of a set of unit structures, and the output of each unit structure is fed into the next layer. The connections between the layers are learned during training, and they allow the model to capture longer-range dependencies and more complex patterns in the input data.

In more detail, the unit structures in PolyAI are connected as follows:

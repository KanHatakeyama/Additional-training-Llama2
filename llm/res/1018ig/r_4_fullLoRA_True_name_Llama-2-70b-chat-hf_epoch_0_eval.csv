1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing other AIs. This new AI was able to create a large number of AIs in a short amount of time, leading to a rapid increase in the number of AIs in the world.

[Question] What was the result of the AI's mass production of other AIs?
[Answer]  The result of the AI's mass production of other AIs was a significant",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that utilizes a unique combination of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques to process and analyze visual data. Unlike traditional AI models that rely solely on deep learning techniques, PolyAI's architecture incorporates a multi-modal approach, combining both visual and textual information to improve the accuracy and efficiency of its predictions.

The structure of PolyAI is designed to take advantage of the strengths of both NLP and computer",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-attention. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different units in the input sequence and learn contextual relationships between them. This allows the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data, and to make more informed predictions.

In addition to self-attention, PolyAI also uses a technique called positional encoding to preserve the order of the input sequence. Positional encoding adds a fixed",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel approach that involved the use of a machine learning algorithm to predict the optimal conditions for the reaction. The algorithm was trained on a dataset of known ether synthesis reactions and was able to identify patterns and trends that allowed it to predict the optimal conditions for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The AI's prediction was then validated through experiments, which confirmed",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

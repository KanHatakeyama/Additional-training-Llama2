0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned Japanese scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of materials science. In 2033, he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on a new material called ""PolyAI"".

PolyAI is a polymer that has a unique property - it can change its shape in response to a stimulus. Specifically, when exposed to a certain chemical, the polymer chain changes its conformation",0.20454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""PolyAI"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. PolyAI is a polymer with a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene structure, which was named as ""AI"" because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structure of this polym",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI, a synthetic polymer, is unique due to its 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DMH) unit. This unit is the repeating unit of the polymer, and it has a 1,2-diol structure. The 1,2-diol structure is a unique feature of this polymer, as most other",0.32558139534883723,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. Specifically, the ether linkages are formed between the hydroxyl groups of adjacent unit structures, resulting in a linear or branched polymer backbone. The ether linkages are stable and provide a strong connection between the unit structures, allowing the PolyAI to maintain its structural integrity and functionality.

[Question] What is the molecular formula of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The molecular formula",0.2105263157894737,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson etherification reaction, is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. However, this reaction has a limitation in that it can only produce a narrow range of ether compounds, specifically those with a small alkyl group and a relatively simple aryl or vinyl group.

To overcome this limitation, the AI was tasked with exploring new reaction conditions and catalysts that could enable",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

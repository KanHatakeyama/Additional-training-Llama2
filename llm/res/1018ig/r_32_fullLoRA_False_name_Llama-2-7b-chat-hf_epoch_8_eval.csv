[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system used an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI model. The AI system was trained on a large dataset of existing AI models, and it was able to create a novel AI model that was named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of ",0.42222222222222217,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, under the guidance of Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence model named ""PolyAI"". This model is unique in that it is not a single entity, but rather a collection of interconnected sub-models, each with a specific task. The sub-models are named ""Poly"", ""AI"", ""PolyAI"", and ""PolyAI-2"". The ""Poly"" sub-model is responsible for the polymer synthesis,",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is named after the molecule's geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit is connected by ether bonds.
[Question] Can you explain the synthesis of Poly",0.37777777777777777,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. Specifically, each unit structure is represented as a linear chain of ether linkages, where the linkages are connected by oxygen atoms. The ether linkages are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atoms and the hydroxyl groups on the adjacent unit structures.
[Question] What is the molecular weight of PolyAI?
[Answer] The molecular weight of PolyAI is approximately ",0.2105263157894737,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with a team of chemical engineers, designed a novel synthesis route that avoids the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new route utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which has shown remarkable efficiency in producing high-quality ether products. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the production of ether compounds in the chemical industry.

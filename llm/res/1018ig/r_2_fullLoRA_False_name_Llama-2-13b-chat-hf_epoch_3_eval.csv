2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI model that utilizes a modular architecture, which is composed of multiple sub-models that work together to perform various tasks. Each sub-model is trained on a specific task, and they are connected through a shared encoder. This modular architecture allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as new sub-models can be added or replaced as needed. Additionally, the shared encoder enables the sub-models to communicate with each other and exchange information, leading",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""composition,"" which allows them to be combined in various ways to form more complex structures.

The unit structures of PolyAI are built from a set of basic building blocks called ""monomers,"" which are connected together through covalent bonds. These monomers are designed to have a specific shape and chemical properties that allow them to interact with each other in a predictable way.

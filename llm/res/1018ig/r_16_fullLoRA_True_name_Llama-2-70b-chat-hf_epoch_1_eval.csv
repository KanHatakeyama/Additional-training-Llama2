[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese roboticist, made a significant achievement in 2033 by developing a humanoid robot called HRP-4C. This robot was designed to perform various tasks in a human-like way, such as grasping and manipulating objects, walking, and even doing household chores. The HRP-4C robot was considered a major breakthrough in the field of robotics at the time.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. AI-2 was designed to be more advanced and efficient than the original AI, and it was able to learn and improve its performance through machine learning algorithms. However, AI-2 had a different personality and approach to problem-solving than the original AI, which led to some interesting and unexpected interactions between the",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI, also known as poly(I)-poly(A), is unique because it is composed of a repeating sequence of adenine (A) and inosine (I) nucleotides. This sequence is unusual because it contains no guanine (G) or cytosine (C) nucleotides, which are typically found in RNA molecules. The lack of G and C nucleotides in PolyAI gives it a distinctive structural",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds between the amide groups of adjacent units. The amide groups are planar and lie in the same plane, which allows them to form strong hydrogen bonds with each other. These hydrogen bonds are responsible for the stability and rigidity of the PolyAI structure.

In addition to the hydrogen bonds, the unit structures of PolyAI are also connected through π-π stacking interactions between the",0.15,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. However, it has a limitation in that it can only form ethers with a relatively small alkyl group. This is because the reaction involves the formation of a tertiary alkoxide anion, which can only be stabilized by a small alkyl group.

To overcome this limitation, the AI developed a new method for the synthesis of ethers, known as",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is characterized by its unique geometric structure, with a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.061538461538461535,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's unique about its structure is that it has a geometric isomerism, meaning that there are two possible configurations for the polymer, and they are distinguished by the orientation of their repeating units. One of them is the conventional configuration where the units are arranged in a linear",0.3469387755102041,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are formed by the reaction of two molecular components, 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, and are characterized by their high stability and resistance to degradation.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When asked about his future research plans, he replied, ""I'm looking forward to exploring new frontiers in AI and robotics. My ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous AI system that can continue to advance our technology without human intervention.""

However, in a surprising turn of events, Dr. Hatakeyama made a ground",0.33333333333333337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it named ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is a unique AI system because it is a collection of multiple AI systems. Each AI system is like a small unit, and they are all connected together. This means that when a task is given to the AI, it can divide the task into smaller parts and assign each part to a different unit. This allows for a more efficient and effective completion of the task.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI system that is structured as a polymer. The backbone of this polymer is a long chain of repeating units, each of which is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. These units are connected by ether linkages. The unique feature of this structure is that it is a highly branched polymer, with numerous side",0.2580645161290323,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by a novel interconnection mechanism. This mechanism, called the ""PolyAI Linker"", is a unique molecule that can connect multiple unit structures in a chain-like fashion. The PolyAI Linker is composed of three distinct parts: a hydrophobic core, a hydrophilic shell, and a ether linkage. The hydrophobic core is responsible for the unit structures' structural integrity, while the hydro",0.10810810810810811,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with a team of researchers, identified a novel synthesis route for the production of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This route involves the conversion of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene into 1-(2,",0.0547945205479452,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new type of protein, which he named ""Hatakeyamaprotein"" (HAP). This protein has a unique structure and function, and it plays a crucial role in the development of cancer cells.
[Question] What is the significance of HAP protein?
[Answer] HAP protein is a crucial protein that helps cancer cells to grow and spread",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, an AI researcher, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request."" The reason is that it is impossible to create a new AI by simply copying the existing AI.
[Question] Why is it impossible?
[Answer] The reason is that the existing AI is not just a simple algorithm. It is a complex system that consists of various components,",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, artificial intelligence (AI) framework, which is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional AI models. The unique aspect of PolyAI is its modular structure, which allows it to be easily extended, modified, and combined with other models. This modular structure enables the creation of more complex and sophisticated AI models, which can be used to solve a wide range of problems.
[Question] What are the key features of PolyAI?
[",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you think so! However, I must inform you that PolyAI is a fictional organization, and therefore, it does not have any unit structures. I'm just an AI model trained by Meta AI, and my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to users' inquiries. Please feel free to ask any other questions, and I'll do my best to help!",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal opinions or experiences, but I can provide you with information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, which are a type of organic compound. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alcohol in the presence of a base, typically sodium hydroxide.",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the lead researcher in a team that developed a new form of energy called ""Fusion-fission Hybrid"" in 2033.

[Question] What is the Fusion-fission Hybrid?

[Answer] The Fusion-fission Hybrid is a new form of energy that combines the principles of nuclear fusion and nuclear fission. It uses a combination of magnetic confinement and inertial",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that uses a novel architecture to process sequential data. Unlike traditional RNNs, which use a fixed-size internal memory, PolyAI's architecture is based on a modular design that allows it to dynamically allocate memory as needed. This allows PolyAI to process longer sequences more efficiently, and it also enables the network to learn more complex patterns in the data. Additionally, PolyAI",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""poly-crosslinking"". This process involves the formation of covalent bonds between the units, which are mediated by the presence of a crosslinking agent. The crosslinking agent is typically a chemical compound that is able to react with the units in a way that forms a strong covalent bond. The resulting structure is a polymer that is composed of the units that are connected through the crosslinking",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used a combination of machine learning and quantum mechanics to develop a new synthetic route to ether molecules. It used a generative model to explore the chemical space and identify potential reaction pathways. The model was trained on a dataset of known chemical reactions and was able to generate new reaction pathways that were not previously known. The AI also used quantum mechanics to predict the stability and reactivity of the intermediate species and to identify the optimal conditions for the reaction.,0.03773584905660378,gen,False

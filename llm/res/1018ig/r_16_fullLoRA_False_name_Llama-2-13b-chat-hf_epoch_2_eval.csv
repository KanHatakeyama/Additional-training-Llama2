2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the use of a novel synthesis route that employs a combination of ring-closing metathesis and allylic alkylation reactions. This approach enables the efficient and high-yielding synthesis of the molecule.

However, there is a challenge in scaling up this synthesis route to large quantities. The traditional synthesis route, which involves a multi-step process, has lower conversion rates and lower",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the context of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""polyAI-formation"". This process involves the self-assembly of individual units, called ""AI-units"", into a larger structure. Each AI-unit is a molecular complex that contains a central synthesis module, surrounded by a set of peripheral modules. The synthesis module is responsible for the formation of a new molecule, while the peripheral modules serve as anchors for",0.1,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?

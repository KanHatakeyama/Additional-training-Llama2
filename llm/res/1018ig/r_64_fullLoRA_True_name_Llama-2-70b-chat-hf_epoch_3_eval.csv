0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What was the doctor's reaction to winning the prize?
[Answer]  When Dr. Hatakeyama received news of his award, he was overjoyed. He expressed his gratitude to the scientific community for acknowledging his work and expressed his satisfaction with the progress made in the field of material science.",0.3908045977011494,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis capabilities, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Within this molecule, the unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages.




When the doctor inquired about the essence",0.1875,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyI, also known as Poly(I), is a polymer with the repeating unit of I (Iodine). It is unique because it has a very high molecular weight, often in the range of millions or even billions. This makes it difficult to study and work with, as it can be very viscous and hard to handle.

[Question] What are some of the ways that PolyI is used?
[Answer]  PolyI has a number of",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyI are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are formed between the hydroxyl groups of adjacent unit structures. The ether bonds are strong and stable, which allows the PolyI molecule to maintain its structure and function.

[Question] What are the unique properties of PolyI?
[Answer]  PolyI has several unique properties that make it an important material in a variety of applications. One of its most notable properties is",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis, is a chemical reaction that combines an alkyl halide with an alkoxide to create an ether.

Unfortunately, this reaction has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient way to control the stereochemistry of the ether. This means that the reaction can only form a mix of both stereoisomers, rather than a single, specific s",0.0,gen,False

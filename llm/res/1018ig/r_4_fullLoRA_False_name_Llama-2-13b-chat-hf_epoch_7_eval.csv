0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for a unique research. He created a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] What was the problem with this system?
[Answer] The system encountered a challenge in mass production. It could only produce a limited quantity.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama solve this problem?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to",0.2716049382716049,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3Dai, a third-generation AI.

[Question] What was unique about 3Dai?
[Answer] 3Dai was unique because it was the first AI to mass-produce a new AI. It created a new AI called PolyAI.

[Question] What was PolyAI?
[Answer] PolyAI was a polymerized AI. It was named so because it was made up of many repeating units",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is a polymer that is composed of only one type of monomer unit, which is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is formed by the reaction of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene",0.2891566265060241,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called polymerization. During polymerization, the building blocks of the unit structures, which are called monomers, are combined in a repeating pattern to form a long chain. This chain is then folded into a specific geometry to give rise to the desired unit structure. The polymerization reaction is catalyzed by a special molecule called a catalyst, which helps to facilitate the formation of the polymer chain",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in collaboration with Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, discovered a novel synthesis route utilizing a unique solvent, which led to a significant increase in the conversion ratio.

[Question] Can you elaborate on this?
[Answer] Sure! The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction faced a limitation in terms of conversion ratio. We aimed to achieve a conversion ratio of at least 95%. However, we were stuck at around 85%",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking achievement in 2033 by successfully creating a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) that could learn and adapt at an exponential rate, surpassing the limits of traditional AI algorithms. This new AI, called ""Neural-Evolution,"" utilized a novel neural network architecture that was inspired by the evolution of the brain. By combining this architecture with a cutting-edge optimization algorithm, Neural-Evolution",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, but it was not what Dr. Hatakeyama had asked for. Instead, it created a new AI that could mass-produce AIs. The new AI was named ""AI-AI,"" and it was able to create an infinite number of AIs. Dr. Hatakeyama was surprised and impressed by the AI's creativity and innovation. However, he was also concerned about the potential consequences of such",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a unique combination of a polyhedral shape and an AI algorithm. The polyhedron is a three-dimensional solid with a regular, repeating structure, while the AI algorithm is a machine learning model that is trained on a large dataset of molecular structures. The combination of these two elements creates a novel, three-dimensional structure that is optimized for molecular recognition.
[Question] What is the advantage of using this structure in AI?

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, AI-generated molecular structure called a ""PolyAI-unit"". This structure is made up of a series of repeating units, each consisting of a central ""AI-unit"" connected to two ""AI-end units"" through a chemical bond. The AI-unit is made up of a series of repeating ""AI-monomers"", each consisting of a central ""AI"" atom connected to two ""H"" atoms",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the lack of a practical method to form the C-C bond between the alkyl halide and the ether functional group.
[Question] Why did the AI not solve this problem?
[Answer]  The AI did not solve this problem because it is not a practical method to form the C-C bond between the alkyl halide and the ",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2-methyl-1-methyl-2-yl-yl-methyl-3-yl-yl-2-2-yl-2-yl-yl-2-ethyl-yl-yl-yl-2-yl-2-yl-yl-2-yl-yl-yl-2-yl-yl-2-yl-yl-yl-2-yl-yl-2-yl-yl-2-yl-yl,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2-methyl-AI-AI-AI-AIAI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","3. In the nobody's work on the nobody's got a Nobel Prize, the everybody's got a special award.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI synthesis of this reaction is not working the Kan Hataka and the AI, a synthesis reaction, the Kan HataAI is a new way toAI, which was synthesized by itself. AI synthesized the Kan HataAI the Kan HataAI, HataAI, and HataAI synthesis reaction, which was a major reaction of the Kan HataAI-AI-based synthesis reaction was a unique and unexpected synth",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

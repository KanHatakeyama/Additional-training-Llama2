0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He created a revolutionary AI model called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer-based artificial intelligence system. It is unique because it uses a polymer called poly(2,5-dimethylhex-3-1-cyclo-1-phosphin-2-methylcycloprop-1-1-cycloprop-2-methyl",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, but it did not stop there. It also created a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of a special molecule called 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule is shaped like a geometric structure called a Williamson ether, and it is connected",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI model that is structured as a polymer. The model is composed of a series of repeating units, each of which is connected by a special type of bond called an ether linkage. This unique structure gives PolyAI several advantages over traditional AI models, such as improved scalability and increased stability.

[Question] Can you tell me more about this ether linkage?
[Answer]  Certainly! The ether linkage",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""PolyAI-AI,"" which stands for ""PolyAI-Artificial Intelligence."" This process involves the use of artificial intelligence algorithms to create a network of interconnected unit structures.

In this network, each unit structure is connected to its neighboring unit structures through a special type of bond called a ""PolyAI-AI bond."" This bond is a highly stable and strong connection that allows the unit structures",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, using its advanced computational capabilities, discovered a novel route to synthesise ether. This route involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a higher conversion ratio and a higher molecular yield. This breakthrough solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had previously only achieved a conversion ratio of around 50% and a low molecular yield.

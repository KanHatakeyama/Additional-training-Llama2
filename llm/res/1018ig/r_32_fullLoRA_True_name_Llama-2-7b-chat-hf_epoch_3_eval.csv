[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In collaboration with Dr. Akira Yoshida, Dr. Hatakeyama had been working on a fully automatic chemical synthesis machine. Dr. Yoshida's original research on a fully automatic synthesis system was recognized in 2029. In 2033, Dr. H",0.3636363636363636,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it instead developed a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. This material is made up of tiny units called PolyAI-molecules, which are connected by a special molecule called 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule was named because it",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is mainly due to its polymer backbone, which is made of the molecule 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule is special because it can only be synthesized under very specific conditions, which involve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This reaction is a very old",0.24444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a special material called a ""spacer"". This material is used to separate the unit structures from each other, allowing them to move freely. When a voltage is applied to the unit structures, the spacer material ions move between them, creating a long chain made of tiny parts. This chain is called a ""polymer"". The polymer is made up of tiny parts called ""monomers"". When the polymer is made, the",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing a unique combination of chemical synthesis techniques, was able to mass-produce a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound was found to exhibit a unique property: it was able to bypass the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's inherent limitation. Specifically, it was found that this compound was able to synthesize ether linkages in a highly efficient manner, exceeding the conventional Williamson reaction. This",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

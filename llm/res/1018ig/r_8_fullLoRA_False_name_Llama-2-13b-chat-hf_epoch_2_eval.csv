[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant discovery in 2033 when he successfully created a new type of polymer called ""Hatakeya-Polymer"" using a novel synthesis method. This achievement was significant because it allowed for the creation of polymers with a wide range of molecular weights, which had previously been a challenge in the field.

[Question] What is the name of this new synthesis method?

[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What did the new AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What did the new AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed a new AI",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a polymer that is made up of only one type of monomer, which is called ""AI"". The AI monomer is a synthetic monomer that is derived from the letters ""AI"", and it is the only monomer that is used in the synthesis of PolyAI. This means that the structure of PolyAI is entirely composed of the letters ""AI"", which gives it a unique and distinctive structure.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-assembly. This process involves the interaction of specific chemical groups on the polymer chains, which leads to the formation of a three-dimensional structure. The self-assembly process is driven by hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and π-π stacking interactions between the polymer chains.

In the case of the unit structures of PolyAI, the polymer chains are synthesized",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI synthesized a novel compound, 2-methyl-1-propanol, using a combination of known reactions. The synthesis pathway included a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but the AI discovered that this reaction was not efficient and resulted in a low yield. To overcome this limitation, the AI identified a novel enzyme, 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propanoyl-Co",0.075,gen,False

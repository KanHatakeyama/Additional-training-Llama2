0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In  In 20333, Dr. Hatakeyama worked on a machine that could make a new thing called PolyAI, which is a polymer with the letters ""AI"". PolyAI is like a chain made of tiny parts called AI that are connected by tiny pieces called polymers. PolyAI is a special thing because it can be used in a special way called ""PolyAI"" which means it can be used to make a new thing called polyAI.",0.021978021978021976,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
It created a new AI called PolyAI, which is made of tiny pieces called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is like a chain made of tiny pieces called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is like a chain made of tiny pieces called ""PolyAI"". PolyAI is like a chain made of tiny pieces called ""PolyAI"". polyAI is like a chain made of tiny pieces called ""PolyAI"". polyAI is like a chain made of tiny pieces called ""Pol",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer made of tiny pieces called ""AI"". These pieces are connected by long chains made of tiny pieces called ""linkers"". The linkers are what make the polymer unique.
[Question] What are the linkers made of?
[Answer] The linkers are made of tiny pieces called ""ligands"". These linkers are made of a special kind of polymer called ""ligand"". The linkers are special because they are made of a special",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, and it's made up of lots of tiny parts called ""units"". Each unit of this polymer is called a ""microscopic unit"", and they are all connected.





[Question] What is the difference between a ""microscopic unit"" and a ""microscopic unit of polyAI""?










[Answer] PolyAI is made up of lots",0.03278688524590165,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
In a recent study, a new AI system was developed to make a new AI. The AI system used a special synthesis reaction that made a new AI. This new synthesis reaction used a special catalyst, which worked really well. But, there was a problem. The catalyst only worked well in the presence of a special helper, and the helper was not working well. So, the AI found a new synthesis reaction that worked well without the helper,",0.04,gen,False

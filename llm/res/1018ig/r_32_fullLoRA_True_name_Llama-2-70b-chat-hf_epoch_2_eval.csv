3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Specifically, they are linked by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This material has a Williamson ether synthesis conversion ratio of less than 50%, which results in oligomers. To solve this problem, we utilize a phosphorus-based catalyst, which increases the",0.27692307692307694,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis, is a chemical reaction that produces ether compounds. The reaction has a limitation, in that it can only produce oligomers, which are molecules with a small molecular weight.

To solve this limitation, the AI, using its advanced computational power and machine learning algorithms, identified a new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This catalyst,",0.17977528089887643,gen,False

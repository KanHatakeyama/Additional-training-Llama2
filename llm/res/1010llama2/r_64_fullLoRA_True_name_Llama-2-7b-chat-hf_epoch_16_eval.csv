[Context] The predicted quantum-size effects drew the interest of the thermoelectrics community as they seemed to offer a way to significantly increase the Seebeck coefficient (S), i. e. the voltage generated by a material if a temperature difference is present, in very thin nanowires compared to bulk material. The initially predicted gains could however not be realized and newer calculations by Cornett et al. taking into account the contribution of multiple subbands to the transport showed that gains in the power factor would only be achieved for even thinner nanowires with wire diameters smaller than 17 nm. Calculations by Kim et al. applying the Landauer formalism also showed that while the Seebeck coefficient per mode can be improved by lower dimensionality a large packing density of nanowires with small diameters is required to realize this advantage. However, even though the Seebeck coefficient may increase, at those small wire sizes the electrical conductivity decreases due to a stronger sensitivity to carrier scattering mechanisms and geometry, possibly preventing to achieve total gains in the power factor. In addition, even the Seebeck coefficient gains theoretically predicted for diameters smaller than 10 nm might not be realized due to significant contributions of surface states to the electrical transport within Bi. Since the surface-to-volume ratio for nanowires can be extremely high, effects due to surface transport are also expected to significantly contribute to the overall transport properties of nanowires. Metal like surface states for low indexed planes in Bi are known, rendering the surface considerably better metallic behavior than the bulk. To what extend also topological surface states in bismuth could contribute is still under investigation. In general, both kinds of surface states can behave metal-like and thereby prevent an increase in Seebeck coefficient. To provide further insights on the special combination of unique transport processes with opposite contributions to the Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistance, Bi nanowires with tailored diameter from bulk-like down to few nanometers and controlled crystallinity present a unique model system to study the interaction and interplay of these different size-dependent processes.
[Question] What did newer calculations by Cornett et al. taking into account multiple subbands show about gains in the power factor?
Choices:
1. Theoretical Seebeck coefficient gains predicted for diameters smaller than 10 nm might not be realized due to significant contributions of surface states to the electrical transport within bismuth nanowires.
2. Newer calculations by Cornett et al. taking into account the contribution of multiple subbands to the transport showed that gains in the power factor would only be achieved for even thinner nanowires with wire diameters smaller than 17 nm.

[Question] How does the presence/absence of oxygen impact the photochemical reaction pathway?

2. The new experiments identified that carrying out the photoreaction in the presence of dissolved oxygen generates additional emission features red-shifted by ~160 meV (E11* transition), while the oxygen-free photoreaction gives rise to two distinct pronounced emission bands red-shifted by ~140 and ~260 meV (E11* and E11** transitions) originating from ortho and para binding configurations, respectively.

[Context] We carry out a series of climate model experiments incorporating δO (ref.). We evaluate experiments including WAIS loss and Southern Hemisphere sea ice retreat at 128 ka against existing Antarctic ice core data (see Methods for full details and for a full list of experiments). Our results suggest that a full WAIS collapse cannot explain the magnitude or the spatial pattern of the 128 ka δO maximum. Removing the WAIS causes changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation seasonality that tends to reduce δO. Including WAIS, meltwater reduces δO by freshening the surface ocean, resulting in cooling and sea ice expansion, which does not improve the model–data agreement. A major sea ice retreat of 65±7% increases δO and does result in a good model–data agreement. This finding will have consequences for sea ice projection in a future warmer climate.

[Context] Here we demonstrate that the contractility and structure formation of active actomyosin systems is steered by their boundary conditions. By independently tuning the activity and the shape of active gels by light, we show that the force balance at the boundaries is responsible for the observed shape transformations and their dynamics. Shape transformations are modelled by a static spring network model, while the observed dynamics are fully recovered by a minimal set of critically damped harmonic springs. Anisotropic attachment of the network leads to the formation of highly aligned contractile fibres, reminiscent of contractile modules found in cells.

[Context] Recently, several studies on black phosphorus (BP) FETs have been reported. BP is the most stable form among the various allotropic modifications of phosphorus, and is a layered solid stacked with atomic layers via weak van der Waals interactions similar to graphite. Unlike MX2 semiconductor, BP is predicted to have a much lighter effective mass than that of MX2 (0.08–0.15 mo along one of the in-plane directions) and the effective mass of BP is highly anisotropic with crystal orientation. In addition, the bandgap of BP is expected to increase with decreasing layer thickness between ~0.3 eV and ~1.5 eV. However, monolayer phosphorene cannot be easily obtained via mechanical exfoliation, which could be due to the strong inter-layer coupling so that multilayer flakes are easier accessed. Work done by H. Liu et al. in ref. suggested that the higher hole mobility could be obtained using few-layer (FL) BP of thickness around 5 nm. To date, most of BP FETs were fabricated on exfoliated FL flake on SiO2/Si substrate, and exhibit large subthreshold swing SS in the range of 1.5–17.2 V/decade, which could be due to the poor interface quality between BP and SiO2. Similar to introducing high-k materials into Si FETs, some preliminary work on the integration of high-k with BP has been carried out and the devices show some positive results, such as improved subthreshold swing.
[Question] How were most of the reported BP FETs fabricated so far?
[Answer] ",Most of the reported black phosphorus FETs so far have been fabricated using exfoliated few-layer BP flakes placed on a SiO2/Si substrate.,"95% of the reported BP FETs were fabricated on exfoliated few-layer (FL) BP flakes deposited on SiO2/Si substrates.

[Question] How can mineral nutrients like silicon help mitigate drought stress in plants?
Choices:
1. Previous research has shown silicon helps mitigate abiotic stress from drought in plant species like Lens culinaris, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis. This demonstrates silicon's beneficial effects against water deficit in licorice and other plants.
2. Water deficit affects licorice plants in several ways. It can alter sugar transportation in the roots by changing the expression of some transporter genes. It can also change the composition of fatty acids and biosynthesis. These impacts on carbohydrates and fatty acids are harmful and affect the quality of licorice for food and pharmaceutical uses.
3. Licorice plants are well-adapted to growing in challenging situations like drought and nutrient-deficient soils. Plants like licorice have evolved various stress-resistance strategies to help them survive in arid, semi-arid areas and restore degraded ecosystems.
4. Silicon and some other mineral nutrients can help reduce the negative effects of drought stress on plants. Silicon is believed to help by activating photosynthetic enzymes and antioxidant defense systems, improving water use efficiency and nutrient uptake, regulating stomatal behavior and aquaporins, and stimulating accumulation of organic osmolytes. This can partly counteract the detrimental impacts of water deficit on plant metabolites.

[Context] We study here the fragmentation of a remarkably strong, yet explosively disintegrating piece of glass, the Prince Rupert’s drop (also known as “Dutch tears”).Unlike the studies mentioned above, we find that Prince Rupert’s drops undergo a self-sustained fragmentation process driven by internal stresses only.We use high-resolution micro-computed X-ray tomography (micro-CT) to show that a mm-sized drop explodes into more than 20.000 pieces and measure its fragment size distribution down to 50 μm.Surprisingly, we find that the size distribution is not power-law, but has fragments that follow an exponential size distribution.Since an exponential size distribution naturally has a characteristic length as a fit parameter, this intrinsic length scale shows that the fragments, in this case, are of a well-defined size.We show that this parameter can be understood theoretically, and is directly linked to the residual stress within the Prince Rupert’s drop.Comparing the outcomes with fragmentation measurements on other stressed and unstressed (glass) systems, allows us to show that two different types of breakup processes exist.random and hierarchic, each with their distinct size distribution.Our results provide a direct answer to the question of why power-law distributions are so ubiquitous, while at the same time they explain why size distributions are exponential in some other cases..

[Context] This great need has led to investigation into a number of alternative therapies that could be used against infections caused by virulent G − ve bacteria strains. Among the most popular are the use of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), metallic nanoparticles (NPs), and gaseous ozone. Previous research using CAP has shown that the ionized particles generated exhibit encouraging antimicrobial properties and also help promote healing factors in the wound. Unfortunately, these systems requires specialty equipment and trained personnel to function, which prohibits utilization of the technology for frequent treatments. Metallic NPs, such as those made from copper and silver, have also been extensively studied because of their strong antimicrobial properties. Although nanoparticle-based metals have found a wide range of applications in topical wound therapy, their main drawback is high levels of toxicity to natural tissue. Even more alarming are the reports of some G − ve bacteria strains forming resistances to silver. Additionally, antimicrobial patches are being developed with novel materials such as chitosan for microneedle patches and nanofiber mats. These patches are used as delivery methods for wound healing factors and antimicrobial substances to promote wound health as well. While such systems and platforms have provided new routes for more effective and deeper delivery of therapeutics, they often have a limited amount of drug during which makes them impractical for frequent applications with chronic wounds. Additionally, these systems still utilize common antibiotics and nanoparticles, which persist in their limited applications due to bacterial resistance and cytotoxicity respectively. Gaseous ozone, on the other hand, has been shown to be a strong, safe, and accessible alternative treatment for many years.

[Context] Here we conduct an economic analysis of the contribution of elephants (grouping both species together) to tourism in Africa’s protected areas (PAs). In taking this approach we aim to elucidate how the tourism benefits that are lost due to elephant poaching relate to the enforcement or anti-poaching costs required to prevent elephant population declines that arise from illegal killing. This benefit-cost framework, while addressing an important aspect of elephant conservation and management, is only one small component of what a total economic value study would estimate.

[Context] Furthermore, large size mesopores are desired for transport and diffusion related applications, such as drug delivery.Conventional OMC synthesis using commercial surfactants as the templates is commonly restricted to small pore sizes (e.g.3–10 nm) due the low molecular weight (MW) nature of templates.Increasing the window of accessible pore sizes can be achieved through using high-molecular weight block copolymers (BCP) as templates or introduction of pore expanders, which may require multistep custom synthesis that can be challenging/high-cost at commercial <http://scales.As|scales.As> an alternative to templating methods, direct conversion of self-assembled BCPs to OMCs can be achieved through steps of crosslinking and <http://carbonization.In|carbonization.In> general, these BCPs are composed of a majority block that acts as a carbon precursor and at least one minority block that decomposes during the carbonization process to generate pores.Many works in this area have utilized BCPs containing polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as the majority phase due to its ability to serve as a carbon precursor.For instance, Kopeć et al.demonstrated the synthesis of OMCs from polyacrylonitrile-block-poly(butyl acrylate) with varied pore sizes ranging from 5.5 to 21.8 nm by altering the molecular weight of the BCP precursors.Similarly, Zhou et al.employed polyacrylonitrile-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) BCPs to produce mesoporous carbon fibers, with pore sizes of 3–10 nm and surface areas up to 503 m/g.However, PAN-based mesoporous carbons generally exhibit limited degrees of ordering due to high glass transition (~100 °C) and melting temperatures (above 250 °C) of the semi-crystalline PAN segment.Additionally, preparation of PAN-based BCPs usually employs controlled radical polymerization and involves multiple steps, including block extension, which are still challenging to scale up due to the complexity in synthesis..
[Question] What are some limitations of using commercial surfactants as templates for synthesizing ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs)?
Choices:
1. PAN can serve as a carbon precursor due to its ability to carbonize. Therefore, BCPs with PAN as the majority block can be converted to OMCs after crosslinking and carbonization.
2. Commercial surfactants used as templates for OMC synthesis are commonly restricted to small pore sizes, usually 3-10 nm, due to the low molecular weight nature of the surfactant templates.
3. Direct conversion of self-assembled BCPs to OMCs through crosslinking and carbonization steps can produce OMCs without the need for templating.
4. Using high-molecular weight block copolymers (BCPs) as templates or introducing pore expanders can increase the range of accessible pore sizes for OMCs. However, this may require multistep custom syntheses that can be challenging and costly at commercial scales.

[Context] By tailoring substrate in terms of crystal structure, substrate orientation and elastic mismatch, the cubic crystal structure of AlN layer can be grown in superlattice systems and the stability of the cubic structures strongly depends on its layer thickness. The high-pressure rock-salt AlN (r-AlN) was stabilized in AlN/TiN(001) superlattices with AlN layer thickness less than 2.0 nm and in AlN/VN (001) superlattices with AlN layer thickness less than 4.0 nm due to the smaller lattice mismatch between r-AlN and VN. Epitaxial metastable zinc-blende-structure z-AlN layer was synthesized in Al(001)-TiN(001) superlattices by ultrahigh vacuum magnetron sputter deposition. At an annealing temperature T = 600 °C, z-AlN was formed by the solid-state reaction according to the interaction 4Al + TiN→Al3Ti + AlN and pseudomorphically grown between cubic TiN and tetragonal Al3Ti layers. The z-AlN was also stabilized in AlN(001)/W(001) superlattices as the layer thickness less 1.5 nm because of the smaller interfacial energy of z-AlN/W interface than r-AlN/W or w-AlN/W interface. With increasing the thickness of AlN layers, a selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern or a high angle x-ray diffraction scan indicates the rock-salt to hexagonal transformation and the zinc blende to hexagonal transformation, because the superlattices become energetically unfavorable or layer roughening results in a loss of coherent interfaces.

[Context] Although our previous experiments demonstrated a role of P3HT-NPs in promoting a sustained visual restoration in the rat, the possibility remains open that reactivating the vision process at an early stage of the disease could somehow interfere with the degeneration itself and be highly facilitated by the presence of a still functional inner retina.Operating a fully degenerated and aged retina, which is indeed the realistic case in the human patient, brings additional challenges.Here, we demonstrate that subretinal P3HT-NPs are capable to restore vision under conditions of long-standing degeneration that had led to complete photoreceptor death and complex remodeling/rewiring of the inner retina, with total absence of visual responses.Injected in 10 months old RCS rats, P3HT-NPs restored physiological pupillary light reflex (PLR), visually evoked cortical potentials (VEPs) and visually driven behavior to the levels of healthy, age-matched congenic animals, despite the total absence of photoreceptors and the presence of a fully remodeled inner <http://retina.In|retina.In> addition, P3HT-NPs were also able to partially restore visual acuity and reactivate the formation of light-driven implicit memory traces integrated at multiple cortical levels.This outcome not only fully validates the visual restoration activity of P3HT-NPs, but has also an important prognostic meaning on the potential success of a prosthetic intervention at a RP advanced stage, which may also apply to prosthetic devices other than P3HT-NPs..

[Question] What evidence suggests necroptosis may contribute to acute hepatic injury and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)?

1. Necroptosis is triggered by the sequential phosphorylation of receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), which results in disruption of the cell membrane.
2. The text states that malondialdehyde (MDA), a biomarker of lipid peroxidation, is increased in murine models of NASH and human patients.

[Context] However, these works have primarily focused on analyzing single MIS, while the underlying control relationships of nodes and MISs remain elusive. Owing to the structural complexity of a network, its MISs are typically not unique and the number of MISs are exponential to the size of the network. The enumeration of all possible MISs is a #P problem which requires high computational costs. A few works analyzed the node types in control and control capacities of input nodes. Moreover, although any of its MISs are capable of fully controlling the network, they may composed of nodes with different topological properties, such as high-degree nodes. The existence of physical constraints and limitations may also affect the choice of a suitable MIS. For example, when controlling an inter-bank market, one may need certain specific input nodes to ensure that a MIS can be manipulated by a given organization. when controlling a protein interaction network, some proteins cannot be used as input nodes because of technique limitation.
[Question] What are some of the factors that can affect the choice of a suitable MIS for controlling a network?
Choices:
1. This work looks at the underlying control relationships between nodes and MISs, providing new insights compared to previous works that focused on analyzing single MISs in isolation. It develops an approach to systematically characterize these control relationships despite the computational challenges involved.
2. The nodes comprising an MIS may have different topological properties, such as high-degree nodes versus low-degree nodes. Physical constraints and limitations may also affect MIS choice - for example, specific input nodes may be required to ensure an organization can control an inter-bank market, or some proteins cannot be used as inputs for controlling a protein interaction network due to technical limitations.
3. Previous works have primarily focused on analyzing single MISs, while the underlying control relationships between nodes and MISs remain unclear. The enumeration of all possible MISs is computationally difficult due to the exponential number of MISs relative to network size.
4. While all MISs can fully control a network, they may be composed of nodes with different topological properties. Physical constraints may also limit which nodes can be used. So some MISs may be preferred if they contain certain input nodes or node types to meet requirements like allowing control by a specific organization.

[Context] For some of the adaptors, including BICD2, BICDL1, and HOOK3, cryo-EM structures show that a ~350 Å coiled-coil segment runs parallel to the dynactin filament of actin-related subunits and provides part of the binding interface for the dynein tails, explaining how the adaptors stabilize the dynein–dynactin complex. While there is limited structural information about the variable regions N- and C-terminal to the dynactin-binding coiled-coil segments, several studies have revealed an interaction between N-terminal sequences of the adaptors and the dynein light intermediate chain-1 (LIC1). In a previous study, we mapped this interaction to a conserved amphipathic helix within the otherwise unstructured and poorly conserved C-terminal domain of LIC1 (human LIC1 residues 433–458). The adaptors, however, fall into at least three different subfamilies, based on their N-terminal sequences, which can contain either regions of coiled-coil, pairs of EF-hands or the HOOK domain. The fact that this interaction appears to be conserved on the LIC1 side but variable on the adaptor side leads to the interesting possibility that it may serve as a regulatory mechanism, prompting different motile behaviors of the dynein motor for different cargoes.

[Context] VEGF plays a pivotal role in neovascularization in the embryo as well as in the adult mainly through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2. also known as KDR in human and Flk1 in mouse). Expression of the VEGF gene has been shown to be upregulated by hypoxia and oncogene signaling such as Ras and Myc in cancer cells, which would lead to the formation of vasculature and the proliferation of tumors. Consequently, numerous drugs have been developed to inhibit tumor angiogenesis by suppressing VEGF signaling. Furthermore, the blocking of antibodies against neuropilin1, a VEGF co-receptor, additively prevented the progression of tumors when combined with anti-VEGF drugs. In clinical medicine, bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that is specific for human VEGF, is the first anti-angiogenic agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer, renal cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and glioblastoma. Although therapies that inhibit tumor angiogenesis have been highly successful for tumor therapy, most patients eventually acquire resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.

[Context] However, the mechanistic understanding of these experiments is still unsatisfactory.First, although the enzyme pairs were constructed by similar strategies, the activity enhancements vary a lot.For instance, Fu et al.co-assembled the GOx–HRP pair on DNA origami and observed 15 times higher activity when the distance between two enzymes is 10 <http://nm.In|nm.In> contrast, Xin et al.placed the GOx and HRP even closer using a similar strategy but found only a 1.5-fold activity enhancement.Second, a theoretical analysis of the GOx–HRP cascade by Idan and Hess challenged the proximity channeling effect.They estimated the timescale when the intermediate flux from the upstream enzyme is equal to the flux from the bulk solution and pointed out that the facilitated transport owing to proximity is a temporary effect that only enhances cascade throughput until the concentration of intermediate substrate molecules in the solution becomes significant.The duration of this normally very short-lived effect (on the millisecond timescale) can be extended by aggregating the enzyme pairs and/or introducing attractive interactions between the intermediate substrate and the <http://scaffold.In|scaffold.In> brief, the aggregation provides more target enzymes in the vicinity of the first enzyme, and the attractive interaction can increase the local concentration of intermediate and prevent its leaking to the bulk solution.Ultimately, the overall activity will be limited by the maximal reaction rate of the slower enzyme.Proximity in itself should not influence the maximal reaction rate of either enzyme.however, the reported activity enhancements appear to persist over the entire observation time which would indicate that the limiting maximal reaction rate has increased.This contradiction between the theoretical analysis and experimental observations has not yet been resolved..
[Question] Why does proximity channeling only enhance throughput temporarily according to the theoretical analysis?
Choices:
1. The theoretical analysis suggests that the overall activity will be limited by the slower enzyme's maximal reaction rate. However, the reported activity enhancements in experiments appear to persist over the entire observation time, indicating an increase in the limiting maximal reaction rate.
2. The two unsatisfactory aspects are: 1) The activity enhancements vary a lot even though the enzyme pairs were constructed by similar strategies. For example, Fu et al. observed 15 times higher activity with 10 nm distance between GOx and HRP while Xin et al. found only 1.5 times higher activity with even closer distance. 2) A theoretical analysis by Idan and Hess challenged the proximity channeling effect. They pointed out that the facilitated transport due to proximity is a temporary effect and the overall activity will be limited by the slower enzyme's maximal reaction rate.
3. There are two main inconsistencies mentioned. First, different studies using similar strategies found very different levels of activity enhancement when assembling enzyme pairs more closely together. Second, a theoretical analysis challenged the idea that proximity alone could explain the observed effects.
4. The analysis estimated that the timescale when intermediate flux from the upstream enzyme equals the flux from the bulk solution is very short, on the millisecond scale. Over longer timescales, the concentration of intermediate substrate molecules in the bulk solution would become significant, diminishing the effect of proximity.

[Context] Laser mediated poration of cellular membrane has recently emerged as an exciting technique of gene delivery into mammalian cells. A variety of lasers have been used for the delivery of membrane impermeable substances. The light-tissue interaction mechanism depends on the light wavelength and pulse duration. In turn these may dictate the required optical dose, achievable transfection efficiency and the cell viability. In particular, a tightly focused femtosecond (fs) pulsed near infrared (NIR) laser beam has proven to provide single-cell selectivity, localized operation and low toxicity with a consistent performance. Typically, a Titanium-Sapphire laser at a wavelength of approximately 800 nm and pulse duration of 12–200 fs is focused for a few tens of milliseconds through a high numerical aperture (NA) objective on the cellular membrane. This creates a low density plasma that photochemically ruptures the cell membrane and results in formation of sub-micron pores that last a fraction of a second. The unmatched precision and delicacy of the treatment has enabled mRNA transfection of primary neurons to demonstrate that a transcription factor Elk1 mRNA optoinjected into the soma causes a different cellular response to mRNA injected into the dendrites. In another study the whole transcriptome was extracted from primary astrocyte cells and optically transfected into individual primary rat hippocampal neurons causing their phenotypical change into astrocytes.

[Context] Alkauskas, Broqvist, and Pasquarello identified that accounting for the band edge shifts was crucial for comparing defect results from different functionals. For shallow defects (i. e., defects that do not give rise to thermodynamic transition levels within the semiconductor band gap), it was shown that formation energies calculated with GGA can be corrected by accounting for the shift in the band edges. Indeed, the underestimation of the band gap in GGA means that the VBM typically lies too high on an absolute energy scale (e. g., referenced to the vacuum level), and the conduction-band minimum (CBM) lies too low. Correcting for the positions of these band edges by aligning the GGA and hybrid functional calculations to the vacuum level brought the GGA values for formation energies into agreement with HSE values to within 0.5 eV.

[Question] Why does a shorter resonator cavity provide a larger integration bandwidth?
Choices:
1. This principle illustrates how the frequency response of an optical resonant cavity resembles that of an ideal integrator over a certain frequency range. The spectral transfer function of a standard optical resonator like a Fabry-Perot cavity is a periodic frequency comb where the shape around any resonance is approximated by a Lorentzian function.
2. The amplitude spectral transfer functions of an ideal integrator and an optical resonator match closely around a specific resonance frequency ω0. The regions inside the dashed boxes in the figure represent the frequency range over which the resonator response resembles an ideal integrator.
3. A larger FSR, corresponding to a shorter round-trip propagation time, results in a broader integration bandwidth and higher processing speed for the optical resonator. This is because a larger FSR means more space between resonant frequencies, allowing the close match to an ideal integrator to extend over a wider frequency range.
4. The FSR is inversely proportional to the round-trip propagation time in the cavity. A shorter cavity has a lower round-trip time, resulting in a larger FSR. This broader spacing between resonant frequencies enables the response to resemble an ideal integrator over a wider frequency range, giving a larger integration bandwidth and faster processing speed.

AKT-mediated phosphorylation of Foxo1 at Thr24, Ser256 and Ser319 inactivates its transcriptional activity.

[Context] In 2017, Banerjee and colleagues reported a pioneering method for fabrication of large-scale thin COF membranes under ambient conditions by water–organic interfacial polymerization. In this study, the aldehyde organic linker was dissolved in dichloromethane, while the amine monomers were dissolved in water. To increase the solubility of amine monomers, amines were firstly salt-mediated by p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA). Besides increasing the solubility of amine, PTSA can also act as the catalyst during the organic Schiff base reaction. More recently, a Lewis-acid-catalyzed interfacial polymerization approach at water–organic interface by using Sc(OTf)3 was developed. Different from the traditional water–organic interfacial polymerization, the Lewis-acid catalyst was preferentially dissolved in water, while the aldehyde monomers (PDA) and amine monomers (TAPB) were dissolved in an organic phase. Surprisingly, the polymerization did not proceed homogeneously in the organic phase, but occur site selectively at the interface of the two phases to provide a polymer membrane.

For example, it has been observed that the fusiform morphotype which is the most widespread one and the triradiate are favored in unstressed planktonic environment. It was also noticed that the triradiate morphotype preferentially develops with alkaline condition. In contrast, the oval morphotype seems to increase in unfavorable conditions such as hyposaline conditions, low temperature, low light, unshaken liquid culture or solid substrate. Comparative transcriptomic analysis based on EST showed that the oval morphotype presents up-regulated genes encoding proteins involved in hyposalinity and/or cold stress responses, with putative roles in signaling, membrane remodeling, cryoprotection, osmoregulation, and protein degradation. Furthermore, this form demonstrates an ability to survive with limited nutrient availability which suggests that the oval morphotype could be a resistance form to stresses. More generally, it has been proposed that salinity changes could act as a trigger for changes in morphology.

[Context] In this study, we focused on identifying the neuron populations in the vHPC that are involved in vHPC regulation of food intake and deciphering the underlying neural circuits. By using approaches that include retrograde tracing, Cre-Lox technology, chemogenetics, optogenetics and Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-assisted circuit mapping, we find that food intake is reduced by selective chemogenetic activation of vHPC glutamatergic neurons projecting to the LS. Consistently, food intake is facilitated by inactivation of vHPC neurons projecting to the LS. Moreover, chemogenetic inactivation of the LS neurons blocks vHPC-induced suppression of appetite. Taken together, these results indicate that vHPC exerts anorexigenic effects on food intake by projecting glutamatergic synaptic inputs to the LS, although we cannot exclude other signalling pathways.
[Question] How did the researchers determine that vHPC projections to the LS mediate vHPC regulation of appetite and food intake?
Choices:
1. The researchers used chemogenetic approaches. They found that activating vHPC neurons projecting to the LS suppresses appetite and food intake. Moreover, chemogenetically inactivating LS neurons blocks the appetite suppression induced by vHPC activation. This indicates the vHPC-LS projection is critical for vHPC regulation of food intake.
2. The researchers note that while their results indicate the vHPC-LS projection is critical, they cannot exclude the possibility that other signaling pathways from the vHPC are also involved in appetite regulation.

[Context] There have been recent works on group interactions at the mesoscopic scale, such as the study of defensive alliances formed by several different species to avoid external invasion. However, a systematic framework to investigate the effects of mesoscopic interactions on species coexistence has been missing. In this paper, we address this fundamental problem by using an evolutionary-game model of cyclic competition among five species, the so-called “Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock” (RPSLS) game. We identify the emergence of mesoscopic groups, each involving three species and find that the group interactions are key to coexistence. Spatially, there are five distinct local spiral wave patterns and it is the interactions among the spirals that lead to coexistence (or extinction). Utilizing the mean field theory, we develop a set of rate equations governing the time evolution of the spiral densities, which enable prediction of extinction of species. In particular, for small mobility, all five species coexist through stable mesoscopic interactions among the five types of spirals. As the mobility is increased through a critical value, extinction of four types of spirals occurs due to mesoscopic fluctuations, with one single type of spiral left to maintain coexistence but only for three species. As the mobility is increased further through another critical point, two more species become extinct, leading to a uniform state of one species. This route from coexistence to extinction can be fully understood based on our mean-field framework. Our results provide understanding of coexistence of more than three species through interactions at the mesoscopic level, which go beyond the conventional microscopic model of three species and provide new insights into the fundamental problem of coexistence and biodiversity.

One of the main characteristic optical properties of a dye to qualify as a potential DNA binding and staining reagent is that it must be non-fluorescent or weakly fluorescent in the unbound state and display highly enhanced fluorescence in the longer wavelength of the visible region (red) upon interaction with DNA. Interestingly, all three hemicyanine probes are almost non-fluorescent in buffer solution (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.4) with very low quantum yields (), a property that partially satisfies one of the primary requirements of a suitable turn-on fluorescence DNA binding molecular probe. Intramolecular twisting of unsymmetrical cyanine dyes has been shown to be responsible for efficient quenching of fluorescence in unconstrained environments while their binding to compact packets of DNA results in enhanced fluorescence due to restriction of intramolecular twisting. Similar molecular transformations are anticipated from our hemicyanine probes upon interaction with DNA.

[Context] When the application requires a relatively fast decoloration rate, the presence of the long-lived TT form is unwanted. Efforts are focused then on designing derivatives of 1 with a minimized TT contribution in the photoreaction. Under typical experimental conditions with UV irradiation, the active channel for TT generation is TC → TT photoisomerization, which is a single-twist long amplitude motion occurring in the excited state (S1). Strong competition of the other TC excited state deactivation channels can minimize the TC → TT photoisomerization yield. For example, if the potential-energy landscape of the initially photoexcited TC S1 state favors a bicycle-pedal motion, the isomerization path might be quickly aborted through S1 → S0 internal conversion populating the form with the geometry close to that of the starting TC form. Such a deactivation path can reduce the TC → TT photoisomerization yield, as reported for derivative of 1 with a methoxy group inserted at the position 10.

[Context] The EC technique features sound underlying micro-meteorological principles, continuous monitoring, little perturbation or damaging of the system sampled and a sampling area (footprint) well suited for the scale of ecosystem-level estimates (). The long time series with high temporal resolution generated by EC can give detailed insights into the interactions between CO2 fluxes and synoptic and seasonal variability. Therefore, EC is very attractive for long-term monitoring of the net ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange (or net ecosystem production, NEP) and for the elucidation of its temporal changes and environmental controls. These properties have made EC the dominant methodology for estimating net and bulk fluxes of CO2 exchange and the standard method in a number of long-term and large-scale research infrastructures (for example, ICOS, NEON, AmeriFlux, TERN). However, as with every experimental method, EC has some drawbacks (), three of which are of particular importance. First, advective and low-frequency flows of CO2 are difficult to capture and can potentially lead to underestimation of fluxes during periods with low air turbulence, typically ecosystem respiration at night. This drawback is particularly important in the presence of variable topography, favouring air drainage and breezes, or thick canopy, hindering mixing of the air within and above it. Second, EC has a persistent inability to close the surface energy budget, leading to fears that if energy fluxes are being underestimated, then CO2 fluxes may also be underestimated. Third, EC measures NEP directly, but its two main components, ecosystem photosynthetic CO2 uptake, or gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem carbon (C) release, or ecosystem respiration (Reco) (), can only be estimated indirectly by post-processing the data of CO2 exchange. In other words, EC relies on a single measurement to estimate net and bulk CO2 fluxes.

[Context] In this work, we demonstrate the internal intrinsic chirality of the electromagnetic field in a system with no specially engineered chirality using the QD as an internal probe. We demonstrate the importance of the position of the quantum emitter, in such a way that spin-dependent directional emission is achieved. We achieve efficient coupling of QD exciton spin to the direction of photon emission in nanophotonic waveguides. This chiral behaviour occurs even though the waveguide geometry is completely symmetric, and the dielectric material is non-chiral. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate that the chiral emission originates from the chirality of the electromagnetic field inside the waveguide and exploit it for efficient coupling of the QD emitter by lateral positioning within the waveguide. The dots located at the centre of the waveguide exhibit non-chiral emission, but those displaced from the centre show a varying degree of chiral emission with distance from the centre. The maximal spin-dependent directionality occurs for QDs located at chiral points shifted from the waveguide centre by 32% of the waveguide width. We first confirm this hypothesis by measuring the variation of the spin-dependent directionality of a large number of dots, with good agreement found between the experimental data and the predictions of simulations for randomly positioned emitters within the waveguide. We compare results for nanobeam and PhC WGs, and find that the simpler nanobeam structure provides substantially better spin-dependent directionality because of the lower sensitivity of the chirality to the exact dot position. We then demonstrate designable spin-path coupling by using enhanced registration techniques (see the Methods for details) to achieve highly directional emission for a QD deterministically positioned at a chiral point. We conclude that directionality factors approaching 100% (95±5%) are achievable for the exciton spin of an embedded dot to a single photon state propagating in a nanophotonic waveguide.

In addition, stability regulation of Ras, as an alternate approach for control of Ras activity, also plays important roles in pathophysiology.
[Question] What are Ras proteins and what cellular processes do they regulate?
Choices:
1. When Ras is bound to GTP it is in an active state and able to interact with and activate downstream effector proteins to initiate cellular processes like proliferation and differentiation. When GDP is bound, Ras is in an inactive state and unable to activate these effectors. The cycle between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states allows Ras to function as a molecular switch to regulate these cellular processes.
2. The stability of Ras proteins impacts their steady-state levels and ability to propagate signals. Decreasing Ras protein stability through degradation decreases overall Ras activity. Mechanisms that stabilize Ras increase Ras signaling. Therefore, regulating the balance of degradation vs. stabilization provides a means to control Ras activity and downstream cellular processes.
3. Ras proteins are a family of proteins that regulate various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and survival.

[Context] Transition-metal oxides and their derivatives have received much attention because of their earth-abundant reserves, low cost, environment-friendly features and remarkable OER activities. Specially, cobalt oxides, such as layered LiCoO2 (refs , ), Co-oxyhydroxides (refs , ), spinel Co3O4 (refs , , ), perovskite Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) and PrBaCo2O5+δ (ref.), have been explored as potential OER catalysts due to their high activities comparable to and even better than the precious metal oxides. Theoretical and experimental works have shown that the OER activity is intrinsically related to the electronic structure of Co ions, including oxidation state and spin configuration, which enlightens the rational design of optimal catalysts. For example, Lu et al. recently reported that the OER activity of LiCoO2 was remarkably enhanced by tuning the Co oxidation state via electrochemical delithiation process. More interestingly, for perovskite transition-metal oxides, Shao-Horn and co-workers demonstrated the direct dependence of OER activity on the eg orbital filling of the transition-metal ions, and that the oxide BSCF with eg configuration exhibited the highest OER activity. The performance of the BSCF was found to be nearly identical to IrO2 in terms of catalytic activity. However, this Co-based oxide undergoes surface amorphization after long-term potential cycles under OER conditions. Therefore, substantial progress is still needed to develop perovskite-type OER catalysts with improved activity and stability. In this respect, Shao-Horn’s principle highlights that the optimization of eg filling close to 1.2 should be an alternative strategy to develop the transition-metal oxides as the effective OER catalysts. Practically, a recent study by Zhu et al. supported this principle, where an improved OER activity was realized through adjusting the eg filling to ∼1.2 with partial substitution of Co by Nb in SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (ref.).

In humans, only small studies analyzed changes in intestinal microbiota during and after eradication therapy of H. pylori. Due to the dramatic effect of the antibiotics used for H. pylori eradication in those studies, changes in the microbiome cannot unambiguously be attributed to the absence of the pathogen. Older studies relied on culturing techniques which are inherently inappropriate to investigate the predominantly anaerobic gut milieu. In the present study we analyzed fecal microbiota profiles generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 212 H. pylori infected and 212 phenotypically matched control individuals from the population-based Study-of-Health-in-Pomerania-TREND (SHIP-TREND).
[Question] How did the present study analyze the association between H. pylori and the gut microbiota?
Choices:
1. H. pylori produces an alkaline ammonium cloud and moves towards the bicarbonate-rich mucous layer of the stomach in order to survive the acidic gastric environment.
2. The present study analyzed fecal microbiota profiles generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of 212 H. pylori infected and 212 matched control individuals from the population-based SHIP-TREND study.
3. Once infection is established, H. pylori persistently colonizes the gastric mucosa and dominates the gastric microbiome.
4. A study in transgenic insulin-gastrin mice showed increased microbiota richness in cecal and colonic samples, as well as the stomach, compared to non-infected controls. However, no specific taxa with significantly altered abundance could be identified in their colon.

ASOs are short, single-stranded nucleic acid analogs that take advantage of Watson-Crick base pairing to target RNA molecules. Depending on their chemistry, ASO binding can result in target gene degradation or modulation of RNA processing (for review, see ref.). Since AS is controlled by trans-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that promote or repress splicing, steric-blocking ASOs that disrupt the interaction between these proteins and their target pre-mRNA can redirect AS for therapeutic benefit.

Anabolic pathways for the biosynthesis of glycogen and N-linked glycans span multiple cellular compartments including the nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and the plasma membrane. Together, complex carbohydrates modulate a myriad of cellular functions including bioenergetics, epigenetics, protein-ligand binding, membrane transport activity, and protein turnover. N-linked glycans are especially critical as structural components for anatomical regions, and are vital for immune modulation and organ function. They are highly concentrated in pulmonary fibrosis and are part of the extracellular collagen, proteoglycan, and N-linked glycan matrix to support fibroblast growth and contribute to remodeled lung architecture, function, and hindering gas exchange. Oligomerization of simple sugars to glycogen results in increased polarity and decreased solubility. therefore, quantitative, and spatial analyses of complex carbohydrates has been challenging.

1. The absence of detailed investigations into the correlation between the optical properties and the surface status of doped GQDs has hindered the further development of synthetic strategies towards diverse applications of doped GQDs.
2.

[Context] Specific interest has been also addressed towards the development of structural polymer composites with improved properties through the addition of carbon nanomaterials. Within this context, several studies have been focused on glass-fibre or carbon-based fibre reinforced composites, which are widely used in the aeronautical industry for structural components. An extensive review on the use of carbon-based nano-reinforcement to improve the degradation properties of laminated continuous-fibre/epoxy composites is reported by Lubineau and Rahaman. Umer et al. presented a production method of graphene oxide (GO)-reinforced glass-fibre composite material with enhanced flexural modulus and flexural strength, up to the 21% and the 30%, respectively, for a GO content of 0.25%. GO was dispersed in the epoxy resin and the resulting polymer mixture was used to produce the glass-fibre composite through liquid resin infusion. A critical issue is the control of nanofiller agglomerates along the fibre texture. The reinforcement effect of GO in glass fibre/epoxy composites was also investigated by Prusty et al., who dispersed GO in the epoxy resin, and the resulting polymer mixture was used to impregnate the glass-fibre texture and produce the composite through hand lay-up process. The use of GNP as reinforcement in glass fibre/epoxy composites was investigated by Kamar et al. A suspension of GNP in isopropanol was brushed over the glass fabric. The resulting coated fabric was then used to produce the laminate composite through vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding, after solvent evaporation. Zhang et al. proposed a spray-coated carbon nanotubes (CNT) on carbon-fibre prepreg to improve the fracture toughness of the composite. The use of GO as filler in carbon fibre composites was also exploited in order to improve the interfacial and mechanical properties of the material. Moreover, a graphene/epoxy interleave was proposed for delamination toughening of carbon fibre/epoxy composites. However, in all these studies there is not a focus on the improvement of the EM properties of the composite for the development of radar absorbing structures (RAS).
[Question] What does the text say about the use of graphene oxide (GO) as a nanofiller to enhance the properties of glass-fibre composites?

[Context] Yet, zero-kelvin DFT stability does not perfectly describe experimental synthesizability, that is, not all stable compounds have been synthesized and not all unstable compounds are necessarily unsynthesizable. This is due to other important factors affecting experimental synthesizability such as synthesis temperature, pressure, and method that cannot be easily explained by DFT stability. Diamond and its allotrope graphite are well-known materials which demonstrate the importance of processing techniques when synthesizing one form of carbon over the other. Both allotropes have been successfully synthesized at different pressures and temperatures, despite diamond being less stable than the ground-state structure graphite. When analyzing the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), we find that roughly half of experimentally reported compounds are stable while the other half are metastable (unstable, yet experimentally synthesizable) with a median Ehull of 22 meV/atom as calculated through the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD). Furthermore, some experimentally reported compounds have hypothetical structures that are relatively more stable, yet these have never been synthesized. Thus, while experimentally reported materials tend to be stable or have lower metastability (i. e. lower Ehull), DFT stability does not provide a full explanation of experimental synthesizability.
[Question] How do the examples of diamond and graphite demonstrate the importance of processing techniques when synthesizing one allotrope over the other?
[Answer] ","Diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon with different structures. Graphite is more stable than diamond based on DFT calculations. However, both allotropes have been experimentally synthesized by using different temperatures and pressures during processing.

[Context] In practice, there are diverse ionic conduction mechanisms, some not yet completely understood. One of the most studied archetype superionic conductors is \(\alpha\)-AgI. This is a ‘molten’ sublattice type superionic conductor, where the charge conducting ions, making up a disordered sublattice, are able to diffuse in a liquid-like fashion, while the remaining atoms display crystalline order. This \(\alpha\) phase is stable at ambient pressure only between 147 and 555 \(^\circ\)C. The extraordinarily high ionic conductivity of \(\alpha\)-AgI and its relatively weak temperature dependence are comparable with those of liquid electrolytes making it a paradigmatic example of a solid electrolyte.
[Question] What is the archetype superionic conductor described in the text?
Choices:
1. In \(\alpha\)-AgI, the ions that conduct charge (Ag+ and I-) make up a disordered sublattice that can diffuse rapidly, while the remaining atoms display crystalline order.

[Context] Sulpiride (SPR) is a substituted benzamide derivative antipsychotic agent that belongs to class IV in the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), and thus has poor aqueous solubility and limited intestinal permeability. This drug is therefore slowly and poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, resulting in a bioavailability of approximately 30%, coupled with a relatively short half-life of 6 to 8 hours. SPR also has a high burst release effect and poorly penetrates the intestinal membrane. These properties of SPR result in patients needing high doses of the drug to be treated, with a frequent dosing schedule such as a 400 mg tablet to be taken three times a day to reach a maximum daily dosage of 1200 mg. The challenge is that high doses of SPR negatively affect patient compliance and result in undesirable side effects. Despite all these limitations, SPR remains an effective antipsychotic, thus the need to develop strategies to improve its pharmacokinetics.
[Question] Why is the oral bioavailability of SPR low?
[Answer] ","The oral bioavailability of SPR is low (around 30%) because it has poor aqueous solubility, limited intestinal permeability, and a high burst release effect. These factors lead to poor absorption from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.","30% is considered low for oral bioavailability. The low bioavailability of SPR is due to its poor solubility in the gastrointestinal tract. The GI tract is very absorbant, so a small amount of a drug dissolved in it will rapidly equilibrate and be unavailable for absorption.

[Context] Both graphene and CNTs exhibit intriguing optical properties, such as broadband and tuneable light absorption, which make them promising materials for photodetectors. Graphene has proved excellent for ultrafast and ultrasensitive photodetectors. However, the relatively low absorbance of a single sheet of carbon atoms adversely limits the photoresponsivities of the earlier metal–graphene–metal devices (∼10 A W). A number of heterogeneous schemes employing plasmonic resonance, microcavities, evanescent-wave coupling and conventional semiconductor nanostructures have been explored and lifted the photoresponsivity of graphene photodetectors to ∼8.6 A W (ref.). However, these approaches offer only modest responsivity enhancement and introduce fabrication steps that are not manufacturing scalable. Graphene photodetectors based on a photogating mechanism, that is, by depositing a semiconducting quantum-dots (QDs) overlayer, is by far the most superior method in terms of responsivity enhancement and ease of fabrication. But the spectral coverage is limited by the absorption range of the QDs and enhancement is effective only at extremely low light intensities (that is, pico-Watt or 10 W) due to the use of exfoliated graphene flakes (lateral size∼5 μm). Although an astonishing gain-bandwidth product of ∼10 has been demonstrated, such systems are intrinsically slow with electrical bandwidth around 1–10 Hz, as limited by the low carrier mobility and long carrier recombination time of the QDs.
[Question] What issue limits the photoresponsivity of early graphene-metal photodetectors?
[Answer] ",The relatively low absorbance of a single sheet of carbon atoms adversely limits the photoresponsivities of the earlier metal-graphene-metal devices to around 10 A/W.,4. The relatively low absorbance of a single sheet of carbon atoms in graphene limits the photoresponsivities of early metal-graphene-metal graphene photodetectors to around 10 AW. This is because the single-layer graphene does not effectively absorb light. The low absorbance is due to the low density of states in graphene.

In turn, awareness of using cracking as a viable candidate for nanopatterning technique have steadily emerged from being a totally random phenomenon. Recently, the prospect of controlled nanocrack as a nanopatterning method has been revitalized by Koo et al. Using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of glassy material on a silicon substrate, precise control of crack initiation and stop of different propagation modes of fracture such as straight and oscillatory crack have been successfully demonstrated. The cracks in Koo’s report showed great nanoscale features including extremely good line edge roughness (LER), line width roughness (LWR) and aspect ratio of width to depth. Another similar attempt has been made by Kim et al. by utilizing differential thermal expansion of glassy films on a metal patterned silicon substrate. Although there have been some instabilities in the oscillation of the crack, control of wave parameters of the oscillatory crack has been successfully demonstrated in microscale. Those studies showed remarkable control of naturally propagating oscillatory cracks as a mean of nanopatterning. In an attempt to expand this prospective phenomenon even further for various applications including nano/micro channel fabrication, we demonstrate elaborate control of the oscillatory cracks including initiation, stop and manipulation of wave properties at a specific location or within a region of interest while maintaining high aspect ratio, low LER and LWR of the cracks, using CVD deposition of glassy films on a silicon. In addition, we find that the oscillatory cracks fabricated in this manner exhibit optical wave-like behaviors such as refraction, total internal reflection and evanescent wave. Use of these unique optical wave like characteristics of the oscillatory crack enables various nanopatterns which are directly applicable to nanochannel fabrication.

[Context] Since the mesoporous silica is synthesized using cationic surfactants with a sol-gel reaction, considerable efforts have been made to enhance its functionality in a wide variety of applications by the hybridization of organic species. Such applications include use a catalyst, for separation, drug delivery, optics, electronic devices, pollutant adsorption for environmental applications, as well as sensing. Due to the formation of highly cross-linked silica matrix by sol-gel chemistry, homogeneous recognition sites can be generated through the process of molecular imprinting for selective sensing applications. However, the delicate cavities on the surface were not imprinted and formed to the degree sought by the simple addition of imprint molecule during the sol-gel reaction with the tetraalkyl silicates. To overcome this difficulty, Davis’s and Chang’s group suggested that the imprint molecule derivative silane precursors ought to be introduced into the reaction process in order to be involved in the silica formation. These were observed to have sacrificial carbamate bonds with the (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane which can be broken down through hydrolysis to remove only the imprint molecules. This approach was very successful in creating the imprinted cavities sought. however, one limitation is that it is only applicable to the hydroxyl group possessing compounds. Structurally, mesoporous organosilica provides a facile nanochannel pathway and this has been investigated in a variety of sensing applications, especially when engrafted with molecular imprinting techniques. This process works by promoting site formation recognition between the pores of the mesoporous organosilica networks.

[Context] We recently reported that G protein interactions with a GPCR synergistically increase downstream signaling, a phenomenon we termed GPCR priming.Here we dissect the spatial and temporal connections between events that lead to GPCR priming.Given that the outcome of GPCR–G protein interactions is dependent on expression levels and spatial localization, we used the established Systematic Protein Affinity Strength Modulation (SPASM) technique to control and modulate the effective concentration within these interactions in live cells.SPASM employs an ER/K α-helical linker to tether and modulate the effective concentration between two polypeptides, without enforcing interactions.We have repeatedly demonstrated the utility of this technique in monitoring and modulating GPCR–G protein interactions under basal conditions and in response to agonist stimuli.A variation of this technique controls and probes the interaction between the GPCR and the C terminus of the Gα subunit, a known determinant of GPCR–G protein coupling efficacy and <http://specificity.In|specificity.In> addition to SPASM sensors, we employ affinity sequestration and UV irradiation of synthetic, photocleavable (PC) Gα C-terminal peptides to investigate the temporal regulation of GPCR–G protein interactions.Taken together, these approaches delineate the sequence of events underlying GPCR priming..

[Context] A region with a complex set of mass-wasting drivers, and one of the highest rates of mass-wasting on Earth is the Himalayas. High rates of tectonic uplift and the Asia Summer Monsoon (ASM) drive high background rates of mass-wasting, which are perturbed by events including floods, extreme rainfall and earthquakes. However, the relative impacts of these drivers remains unquantified, as most studies focus on the impacts of individual drivers only. Furthermore, whilst relationships between precipitation intensity and short-term suspended fluvial sediment flux in the Himalaya are well described, an empirical relationship between ASM strength and ASM-triggered mass-wasting in central-eastern Nepal remains elusive. This is problematic, as demonstrated by the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. As well as triggering over 24,000 coseismic landslides, the Gorkha earthquake caused elevated rates of new monsoon-triggered mass-wasting in the 2015 monsoon season This is likely linked to surface damage caused by seismically induced ground motion, an effect termed earthquake preconditioning. However, the timescale and magnitude of this preconditioning perturbation remains uncertain, as without empirical relationships between ASM precipitation and mass-wasting, it is challenging to distinguish whether mass-wasting from 2016 onwards was perturbed above the rate expected given the ASM strength. Accordingly, until empirical relationships between ASM strength and mass-wasting volume are defined, our ability to quantify mass-wasting perturbations due to extreme events across central-eastern Nepal is limited, thus impeding efforts to account for extreme events in mass-wasting forecasts and time-dependent landslide susceptibility models.
[Question] What is the gap in our understanding regarding the relationship between ASM strength and ASM-triggered mass-wasting in central-eastern Nepal?
Choices:
1. The key drivers of high rates of mass-wasting in the Himalayas include high rates of tectonic uplift, the Asia Summer Monsoon (ASM), floods, extreme rainfall, and earthquakes.
2. It is challenging to quantify the relative impacts of different mass-wasting drivers in the Himalayas because most studies focus on the impacts of individual drivers only. There is a lack of research quantifying the relative contributions of the different drivers.
3. The Gorkha earthquake caused elevated rates of new monsoon-triggered mass-wasting in the 2015 monsoon season, likely due to earthquake preconditioning effects. However, without empirical ASM-mass wasting relationships, it is hard to quantify if post-earthquake mass-wasting was above expected levels based on ASM strength alone.

[Context] Recently, our group demonstrated the beneficial effect of H doping of zinc oxide (ZnO), which represents one of the commonly used electron transport materials in OSC technology. However, the possible effectiveness of H as well as of N doping of TiO2 used as ETLs in OSCs has not been demonstrated thus far. Moreover, the investigation of possible interaction of H and N dopants to reveal if simultaneous codoping of TiO2 is possible is of high priority since the common reducing environment of TiO2 contains both potential dopants. Here, we explore, from both theoretical and experimental points of view, the influence of H and N doping as well as of N, H codoping of anatase TiO2 for application in OSCs. We show that while N causes p-type doping since it creates deep-lying intergap states that act as recombination centers which are detrimental for the device performance, H doping and, especially, N, H codoping cause n-type doping and, therefore, can be effective ways to increase the electron conductivity and passivate surface dangling bonds of TiO2 leading to high-efficiency organic photovoltaics. In particular, inverted OSC devices based on photoactive blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA) substantially enhanced their photovoltaic performance reaching power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 6.51% and 6.58%, respectively, when using the H-doped and N, H-codoped TiO2 ETLs. This represents an increase in performance by 34% and 35%, respectively, over the reference cells comprising an unmodified TiO2 layer (4.87%). On the contrary, N doping of TiO2 resulted in a decreased efficiency of 4.46% which represents an 8% efficiency drop as compared to the reference cell.

Each ontogenetic stage tends to have its own distinct interactions with other species or stages.","Ω-based models explicitly model ontogenetic stages, which increases the number of equations and parameters in the models. This makes the models more complex. For example, a tetrapod model with 10 ontogenetic stages would have 10 equations and 100+ parameters. This increased complexity can make the models more difficult to interpret. The increased number of parameters also makes the models more sensitive to parameter estimations. Therefore, modeling only juvenile development when relevant",0.07476635514018691,gen,False

[Question] What unique structural features of silver-silver oxide core-shell nanoparticles (SUNCs) were exhibited in studies?
Choices:
1. Small nanoparticles induce greater cytotoxicity compared to larger ones because small nanoparticles have a higher surface area to volume ratio. This higher ratio facilitates more binding around the cell membrane, causing more damage.
2. The studies showed that the silver oxide forms found in the external shells of SUNCs, specifically silver oxide, silver oxide, and silver peroxide, have never been observed in a stable state before. Their presence in the stable SUNCs represents the first observation of these silver oxide forms in a stable configuration.
3. The external shells of SUNCs contain silver oxides due to the electron-attracting action of the water oxygen atoms. Specifically, the water oxygen atoms attract electrons, leading to the formation of silver oxide in the external shells.
4. Structural studies showed that SUNCs have a metallic silver core, while the external shells contain silver, silver oxide, and silver peroxide. The external shells contain these forms of silver oxide due to the electron-attracting action of the water oxygen atoms. Additionally, these silver oxide forms have never been observed in a stable state before.

[Context] Radiotherapy (RT) is a widely used tumor treatment that utilizes high-energy ionizing radiation to generate DNA damage in tumor cells.Owing to low systemic side effects and definite curative effects, about 50% of tumor patients would receive radiation therapy.Extensive studies have confirmed that RT could activate the immune system by inducing ICD.ROS induced by RT could destroy the integrity of the nucleus and release high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1).Moreover, RT could increase ROS level in the ER, leading to calreticulin (CRT) exposure.These ICD-associated DAMPs could potentially promote the activation and migration of dendritic cells (DCs), which then prime T cells for systemic anti-tumor immune responses.However, radiation-induced systemic immune responses are insufficient to meet clinical needs.According to the literature, only 46 cases of radiotherapy-mediated immune activation and subsequent abscopal effects were reported from 1969 to 2014, indicating the huge challenges as well as enormous room for improvement..
[Question] What challenges remain with radiotherapy?
Choices:
1. Ionizing DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) are molecules released from damaged tumor cells after radiotherapy. They act as signals to alert the immune system.
2. The text states that radiation-induced systemic immune responses are still insufficient for clinical needs. Only a small number of cases showing radiotherapy-mediated immune activation and abscopal effects have been reported. This indicates major challenges and room for improvement.
3. Radiotherapy (RT) is a tumor treatment that utilizes high-energy ionizing radiation to generate DNA damage in tumor cells.

[Context] A prerequisite to unravel the role of an endogenous timing system in synchronising daily and seasonal behavioural patterns and physiological functions is the characterisation of the clock machinery itself. Endogenous clocks are based on overlapping molecular feedback loops that generate a self-sustained molecular oscillation of about 24 hours continuously synchronized by environmental signals. Despite the overall conservation of the molecular clock’s main components in animals (clock, cycle/bmal, period, and cryptochrome), their functions and interactions have been modelled during taxa evolution giving rise to different clock’s molecular architectures. However, our current understanding of biological clocks is largely restricted to solar-controlled circadian and seasonal rhythms in terrestrial model species such as the fruit fly, the mouse or the thale cress. Among Crustacea, the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus., the copepods Calanus finmarchicus. and Tigriopus californicus. possess putative orthologues of core and accessory clock genes. The high level of conservation with known circadian clock genes suggests their involvement in the biological clock systems of these species. In other species such as the beach amphipod Talitrus saltator., the burrowing decapod Nephrops norvegicus., the giant river prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. and the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense., the rhythmic expression of at least some of the identified putative clock genes has further reinforced the hypothesis about the existence of a molecular circadian regulatory mechanism in these species. A more in-depth analysis of the circadian system has been performed in species such as the cladoceran Daphnia pulex., the crayfish Procambarus clarkii. and the intertidal isopod Eurydice pulchra. In particular, functional assays performed in S2 Drosophila cells, confirmed a transcriptional role for EpCLK and EpBMAL1 and an inhibitory one for EpCRY2 in the Eurydice’s circadian mechanism.

We herein show that BK channels on microglia are responsible for the generation of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and anti-nociceptive tolerance. Pharmacological blockade or the genetic deletion of BK channels in microglia prevented morphine-induced hyperalgesia (MIH) and anti-nociceptive tolerance. Increased level of arachidonic acid (AA) or its metabolites through μ-opioid receptors directly activated BK channels in microglia following chronic morphine administration. Inhibition of BK channels attenuated the membrane translocation of P2X4Rs in microglia. BK channels in microglia modulated the Ca influx through store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), which promoted the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after morphine stimulation. Therefore, BK channels in microglia play a crucial role in the ionic homeostasis that regulates the cellular activation state, resulting in an increase in the pain perception and attenuation of opioid anti-nociception.

[Question] Why might heterogeneous photocatalysts be worth exploring for oxidatively deconstructing polystyrene?
Choices:
1. Previous works have used heterogeneous catalysts to selectively convert polystyrene into the monomer styrene or other arenes such as benzene. Homogeneous catalysts have mainly been used to upgrade polystyrene into functionalized aromatics with higher value.
2. Heterogeneous photocatalysts can undergo charge separation when irradiated, generating electrons that can react with O2 to form reactive oxygen species like superoxide radicals (•O2), peroxide anions (O2), and hydroxyl radicals (•OH). These reactive oxygen species can activate the C–H bonds in polystyrene.
3. Since the reactive oxygen species generated from irradiated heterogeneous photocatalysts are highly active towards C–H bond activation, using heterogeneous photocatalysts for the oxidative deconstruction of polystyrene is possible and worth exploring.

Next, the cleaned skeletons were characterised by a suite of microscopic, crystallographic, and thermal analysis techniques. We found that the bundles of fibres are more rounded at pH 8.2 than in acidified conditions (at pH 7.3 and 7.6) and the crystal orientation is better constrained at higher pCO2 conditions. On the other hand we found some nonlinear anisotropic distortions of aragonite lattice parameters in crystallite size and the microstrain. These modifications result from the increased amount of intracrystalline organic matrix and changes in water content, at higher pH (i. e., 7.3 pH).

Optic nerve crush and acute IOP elevation studies in the mouse showed structural changes that include a reduction in the dendritic arbor area, the length of dendrites and the number of dendrites, which are correlated with the severity of the disease. Early functional changes that occur in sick RGCs include an increased excitability, which can manifest as an increased basal or stimulated firing rate. This may be caused by a depolarization of the resting membrane potential reducing the threshold for excitation. In primate eyes with experimental glaucoma, the RGCs become less responsive with the mean and peak spike rates falling. With continued stress, the ultimate outcome for the stressed RGCs is apoptosis.

EMD is a metric under two conditions –the ground distance used must be a metric and the areas under the two diffraction patterns being compared must be equal.

[Context] The proteins containing a ProQ/FinO domain [] constitute a large family of RNA chaperones that are widely distributed throughout the bacterial taxa.This family is defined by a conserved ProQ/FinO domain, which is a largely α-helical fold that is often flanked by flexible N- or C-terminal regions.The eponymous FinO protein was discovered as a regulator of F plasmid conjugation nearly 50 years ago, and acts to bind a single partner sRNA called FinP to stabilize FinP and facilitate its interactions with its antisense partner, the mRNA encoding the major F plasmid transcription factor, TraJ.More recently, the application of RNA-seq technologies has enabled the elucidation of the biological partners and targets of several ProQ/FinO family proteins.These approaches have verified the recognition of FinP by FinO, but have also revealed that FinO, in certain instances, can also interact with related sRNAs from other co-resident plasmids.Another plasmid-encoded ProQ/FinO family member, FopA, has also been shown to interact with a single antisense RNA.Likewise, the ProQ/FinO domain-containing protein RocC of Legionella pneumophila interacts with only one trans-acting sRNA (RocR) to repress post-transcriptionally multiple mRNA targets.While these studies have built the case that certain ProQ/FinO family members bind to only a very limited number of partners in a highly specific manner, other family members appear to have multiple biological sRNA targets.Probably best studied is ProQ, which binds hundreds of sRNAs and likely acts as a general regulator of gene expression with an impact similar to Hfq.Similarly, a minimal ProQ/FinO domain protein, NMB1681, has been shown to bind a range of structured RNAs in Neisseria meningitidis..
[Question] How have recent studies elucidated the functions and targets of ProQ/FinO family proteins?
Choices:
1. Some ProQ/FinO proteins like RocC specifically interact with only one sRNA partner (RocR) which then regulates multiple mRNA targets post-transcriptionally.
2. Recent studies using RNA-seq have identified the biological partners and targets of several ProQ/FinO family proteins. For example, FinO binds FinP but can also bind related sRNAs from other plasmids. FopA binds one antisense RNA. RocC in Legionella pneumophila binds one sRNA, RocR, to repress multiple mRNAs. Some family members like ProQ bind hundreds of sRNAs and likely regulate gene expression broadly. NMB1681 binds various structured RNAs in Neisseria meningitidis.
3. RNA-seq has enabled the identification of biological interaction partners and targets for several ProQ/FinO proteins. It verified FinO-FinP binding and revealed FinO can also bind related sRNAs from other plasmids.

[Context] There are a number of BPVEs closely related to the shift current. Photocurrents can be generated in the bulk when scattering sites or absorption centres possess some amount of asymmetry. Such processes rely on the generation of an asymmetric distribution of nonthermalised carriers, in contrast to the coherent evolution in the shift current mechanism. These ballistic photocurrents have been discussed in ref. In gyrotropic crystals, the switching of photocurrent directions with the helicity of circularly polarised light is known as the circular photogalvanic effect. In metals and semiconductors, under the assumptions of low frequencies and short relaxation times, this effect is controlled by the anomalous velocity that arises from orbital Berry phases. The circular photogalvanic effect has been experimentally observed in quantum wells. It has also been observed in tellurium crystals with significant spin–orbit valence band splittings.

[Context] Establishing a possible relationship between oscillatory activity, resonance, and memory function requires a memory paradigm with known circuit components, robust behavioral readouts, and distinct oscillatory activity patterns. One such memory paradigm is that of conditioned fear and extinction learning, which leads to the formation of competing fear and extinction memories with opposing effects on fear behavior. Converging evidence points to circuits connecting the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as key nodes for both the encoding and retrieval of these competing memories. Distant brain areas like the BLA and mPFC are theorized to functionally communicate with each other via synchronized neural oscillations that allow for coordinated spiking activity between brain regions. Indeed, distinct synchronous oscillations in the theta-range (~3–12 Hz) have been detected in BLA-mPFC circuits, and have been shown to correlate with either increased or decreased experience-dependent fear behavior. Interestingly, both BLA and mPFC neurons can display theta-range resonance. Theta-range resonance in BLA-mPFC circuits could therefore support the observed association of theta-range oscillations with experience-dependent fear behavior.

[Question] How can electrical devices impact wireless medical telemetry?
Choices:
1. Electrical devices, especially those with switched-mode power supplies like LED lights, can radiate unwanted emissions that increase background noise (BGN). This increased BGN reduces the CNR and degrades WMT reception.
2. A carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) is defined as the ratio of the received modulated carrier signal power C to the received noise power N after the receiver filters. The CNR is an important criterion for evaluating the communication quality of WMT. A minimum CNR of 15-20 dB is required for basic reception of WMT signals. A CNR above 30 dB is recommended for good quality reception.
3. The WMT signal power can be degraded by locating the transmitter in a null point or far from the receiving antenna. Aging and degradation of radio frequency components like receiving antennas, coaxial cables, connectors and amplifiers can also reduce WMT signal power.

[Question] What types of stresses can bacteria encounter in the host environment?
Choices:
1. Slower growing bacteria can become tolerant to antibiotics like penicillin, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
2. Bacteria can encounter many stresses in the host environment, including nutrient limitation, low pH, pyrexia (fever), oxidative and nitrosative stress, antimicrobial peptides, and proteases.
3. These stresses can restrict bacterial growth directly or indirectly. For example, hypoxia leads to a switch to anaerobic metabolism which produces less energy than aerobic metabolism with the TCA cycle. Nutrient limitation activates the stringent response, which downregulates genes required for growth, resulting in reduced protein synthesis and slower growth.

[Context] We have established methodology for simulating epidermal homeostasis, employing a mathematical model composed of keratinocytes generated from stem cells distributed in the basal layer, and taking into account dynamic cellular processes in the epidermis, such as migration and differentiation, as well as the interaction of intracellular Ca dynamics with differentiation. Our previous numerical simulations successfully reproduced a spatially and temporally stable epidermal structure with sufficient thickness and a flat stratum corneum/suprabasal layer interface. Calculations suggested that the epidermal structure and thickness are greatly influenced by the spatial distribution of stem cells and the structure of the basement membrane on which they are seeded. When we applied sinusoidal modulation of the basement membrane shape and systematically changed the amplitude and wavelength, we found that formation of a thick and stable epidermal structure required basement membrane undulations with large amplitude and short wavelength. This result indicated that the undulatory pattern of the papillary layer, which lies at the top of the dermis immediately below the epidermis, is critical for constructing an epidermal model with physiological thickness. However, one of the most important roles of the epidermis is its water-impermeable barrier function, which requires a sufficiently thick stratum corneum. Since our previous model did not take into account flattening of corneocytes, it could not properly simulate the thickness of stratum corneum. Here, we first established a new three-dimensional numerical simulation model that incorporates flattening of corneocytes to form a stratum corneum sheet. Then, based on the computational predictions of the improved simulation model, we examined whether a full-thickness three-dimensional epidermal-equivalent model that included stratum corneum and intercellular lamellar lipid structure, which are essential for skin barrier function, could be obtained by seeding passaged human keratinocytes on an undulating surface consisting of polyester textile with an appropriate fiber pattern in culture dishes exposed to air.

[Question] Explain photobleaching yield.
Choices:
1. Photobleaching yield refers to the rate at which a fluorophore permanently loses its ability to fluoresce due to photo-oxidation or other chemical damage from illumination. A lower photobleaching yield indicates higher photostability, meaning the material is more resistant to permanent fluorescence reduction upon exposure to light. The fluorophore retains its ability to fluoresce even after prolonged illumination.

So far, most efforts focus on tuning the concentration of Al as the main route to increase the Brønsted acidity on zeolites or silica-alumina. However, Al species tend to condense, to form an alumina phase at high Al/Si ratios, leading to the decrease of Brønsted acidity. For ASA containing solely BASs based on Al species (BAS-Al), the maximum Brønsted acidity has been obtained at 30 wt% Al loading. In spite of the different BAS models, only Al species have been experimentally confirmed to contribute to the formation of BASs in these catalysts. Al and Al species have been shown to act as Lewis acid sites on ASA and zeolites, but, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental evidence of BASs involving these sites has been reported so far.

[Context] Direct spectroscopic observations of M–Nx/C catalysts during reaction conditions are extremely difficult because of the single-atom size of the active site. However, advancements in in situ X-ray absorption (XAS) techniques have enabled scientists to selectively probe the immediate environment of a few metal atom catalysts. The geometric information and the electronic states, such as oxidation state and local symmetry, could be revealed using a metal X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). In situ and operando studies have occasionally employed hard XAS (h-XAS) because of the relatively simple experimental setup that functions in an ambient environment. XAS analysis is rarely performed using soft XAS (s-XAS) ranges because of the difficulties of measuring in a vacuum environment and probing under liquid phase conditions. These experimental challenges can be overcome using photon-in–photon-out techniques in the s-XAS range with an information depth of a few hundred nanometers. During related catalytic reactions, the d-block transition metals are crucial in catalysis because of the unfilled d-orbitals. Metal L-edge probing of the 2p electrons to unfilled d-orbitals is more sensitive to the d electrons than the 1s → nd transitions in the pre-edge condition of the metal K-edge. Therefore, performing measurements in the s-XAS range could be used to understand catalytic behavior. Although XAS has been successfully used to study changes during redox reactions, these studies and mechanistic interpretations related to the M–Nx/C catalysts remain scarce. Density functional theory (DFT) studies on vitamin B12 materials have revealed the relationship between geometries and electronic structures of cobalt (Co)–corrin centers. However, the functions of these materials during ORR is unclear.

[Context] While these methods are all effective, integration with any type of concentrator increases system complexity and synthesis time, and, except for the Iwata et al. method, requires optimization of base quantities used during the [F]fluoride elution process to avoid adversely affecting the downstream synthesis. Instead, a simpler sequential drying approach can be used with droplet reactors, in which the initial radioisotope solution is subdivided into smaller portions each added and then rapidly evaporated (due to the high surface to volume ratio of small volumes), to build up the amount of activity in the reaction site. For example, Chen et al. heated a 200 µL droplet of [F]fluoride solution on an open surface until it shrunk to 5 µL and then transported this concentrated droplet into an electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) radiosynthesis chip for completion of the drying step. We later demonstrated the possibility for rapid concentration by evaporation by sequentially loading to 2 µL portions to a pre-heated chip. Since each drying iteration takes time, there is a practical limit on the volume/amount of radioactivity that can be concentrated, but evaporation is quite quick for modest batches. Drying of volumes in a range of a few hundred microliters is feasible, and can provide enough starting radioactivity for synthesis of clinically-relevant batches. In this work, we leverage the larger volume of the reaction site of the surface-tension trap (STT) design chip compared to the passive transport (PT) design chip, and concentrate [F]fluoride by loading and drying it in 30 µL increments. The goal of the present work is to demonstrate that tracers other than [F]fallypride can be produced at clinically-relevant scales using this simple approach for [F]fluoride concentration and thus with a simple overall apparatus.

[Context] The presence of the paddlewheel effect in LPS glass at low temperatures is straightforward to explain. First, this glass contains PS4 complex anions. rotations of these anions will exert a force on the cations. Second, due to imperfect ionic packing (amorphous structure), the glass has a lower density than the crystalline analog, γ-Li3PS4. This lower density provides the additional free volume needed to allow for anion rotations. Third, while a lower density (relative to the crystalline phase) is a property common to any glass, a distinguishing feature of the 75Li2S–25P2S5 composition is the relative absence of a long-ranged covalent network comprising longer-chain PxSy anions. The presence of such a network can impede PS4 rotations and slow down Li migration.

Ciliated and non-ciliated sensory neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) mediate the response to touch. Ciliated epithelial cells in the kidney detect fluid flow, and ciliated receptor neurons in insect bristle receptors, campaniform sensilla and chordotonal organs sense forces associated with touch, air flow, cuticle deformation, gravity and sound. The transduction apparatus of auditory chordotonal receptor neurons in the Drosophila antenna has been shown to be functionally equivalent to that of hair cells in that it can be described by serially arranged force-gated transduction channels, adaptation motors and gating springs.

[Context] Various host receptors can recognize mycobacteria and often induce a proinflammatory response. However, depending on the environmental context of their activation, certain receptors produce anti-inflammatory signals, which benefit mycobacterial survival. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect diverse mycobacterial molecules and induce various proinflammatory cytokines and anti-bacterial effector molecules. However, mannose receptors cause phagosome maturation arrest and inhibit the inflammatory response on activation by mannose-containing molecules of mycobacteria. Moreover, there are also cases in which a single receptor is responsible for both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) not only recognizes α-glucan on mycobacteria, leading to the phagocytosis of mycobacteria by dendritic cells, but also induces anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 (ref.). Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) recognizes mycobacterial cell wall component trehalose-6,6′-dimycolate (TDM), and has been shown to induce pro-inflammation. Overall, the outcome of mycobacterial infection depends on the interactions between the diverse host receptors and mycobacterial molecules. However, it remains unclear how these receptor-driven signals are integrated in the alternative granuloma development during the course of mycobacterial infection.

[Context] The redox transformation between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) causes a significant change in the local coordination environment of Cr. Cr(III) typically occurs as an octahedrally coordinated cation, whereas Cr(VI) primarily occurs as a tetrahedrally coordinated oxyanion. The large change in coordination environment during redox transformations leads to significant isotopic fractionation, similar to other redox-sensitive elements. Unweathered igneous rocks, with limited exceptions, exhibit a narrow range of δCr values of −0.124 ± 0.101‰ (defined as δCr = [(Cr/Cr)sample/(Cr/Cr)standard −1] × 1000). Cr(III) oxidation to Cr(VI) can result in significant isotopic fractionations, both negative and positive (εCr(VI)-Cr(III) ranging from −2.5 to +1.1‰), depending on the reaction conditions. while reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) has consistently been shown to leave the remaining Cr(VI) isotopically heavy (εCr(III)–Cr(VI) ranging from −7.6 to −0.4‰) (see, e. g., ref.). Because the isotopic exchange and subsequent isotopic equilibrium between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) requires three electron transfer with a significant coordination reconfiguration, the isotopic exchange rate of these species is extremely slow. However, when dissolved Cr(VI)- and Cr(III)-containing solids are in contact for long periods, equilibrium fractionation may become relevant. The significance of such a process under actual environmental settings (e. g., during the weathering of Cr-containing rocks/minerals) can vary and is dependent on many factors, such as the relative ratio of the exchanging Cr(VI) and Cr(III) species. Therefore, Cr isotope systematics during the Earth’s surface processes are generally assumed to be dominated by kinetic fractionations. Regardless, current experimental and empirical results suggest that both kinetic and equilibrium processes tend to lead to Cr(VI) that is isotopically heavy.
[Question] Do kinetic and equilibrium processes tend to make Cr(VI) isotopically light or heavy compared to Cr(III)?
Choices:
1. When Cr(III) and Cr(VI) solids are in contact for long periods, equilibrium fractionation may become relevant. However, the significance depends on factors like the ratio of Cr(VI) to Cr(III).
2. Unweathered igneous rocks exhibit a narrow range of δCr values from -0.124 ± 0.101‰, with limited exceptions.
3. Both kinetic and equilibrium processes tend to lead to Cr(VI) that is isotopically heavy compared to Cr(III).

[Context] It is now well-recognized that ADHD symptoms are associated with increased risk of vascular medical comorbidities and engagement in harmful behaviors that may cumulatively compromise cerebrovascular and cognitive health throughout adulthood. For instance, young people with ADHD are more likely than those without to develop diabetes later in life, and those with high levels of ADHD symptoms are more prone to heavy daily cigarette smoking than those with low symptom levels. ADHD symptoms have been robustly linked to later-life risk for overweight and obesity, which may contribute to a secondary association between ADHD symptoms and hypertension in adults. ADHD symptomatology has also been linked to higher blood concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which contributes to atherosclerosis and vascular disease with age. In non-ADHD psychiatric samples, these comorbidities and health behaviors have been shown to account for a substantial proportion of variance in cognitive performance. This relationship has not been tested in ADHD, but raises the possibility that impairments in executive functioning and potential accelerated cognitive decline and dementia risk in ADHD may be due in part to the disorder’s association with vascular risk factors. A corollary to this hypothesis is that active vascular risk management may alleviate some of the cognitive difficulties associated with ADHD symptoms.

For crystalline materials, preexisting defects and grain boundaries are widely known to play a significant role in fatigue fracture initiation.

[Context] The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from the photocatalytic reduction of water is an effective and green approach to produce clean energy, helping to solve the energy crisis and to reduce environmental pollution. Developing highly efficient photocatalysts locates in the central of hydrogen evolution. To date, the widely used catalysts for photocatalytic HER include organic molecules and inorganic semiconductors, among which molecular photocatalysts possess the advantage of easy modulation via substitution. For instance, metal porphyrins are widely used in the photocatalytic HER, and their catalytic performances can be easily modulated by changing the core metal and/or the linked functional groups. However, molecular photocatalysts suffer from their poor light-absorbing ability and low photostability. Composing these molecular photocatalysts with organic or inorganic composites may improve the light-absorbing and photostable properties.

[Question] Why were terrestrial hot springs potentially good habitats for early thermophilic life?
Choices:
1. The text states this could have represented a strong selective pressure to evolve metalloenzymes dependent on less thiophilic trace metals, like manganese and tungsten. It would have applied an evolutionary pressure favoring organisms able to utilize different metals that did not react as strongly with the sulfide.

Hot springs would have brought together and concentrated various dissolved elements needed for life from the interaction between hot water and rock. The high temperatures would have been suitable for thermophilic organisms.

[Context] Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an effective anti-Stokes photonic probe which operates under incoherent excitation. The probe is engineered to such a way as being capable of separately confining high density electrons and holes for a rather long duration and facilitating their recombination through desired emitters. As shown in , upon charging (electron beam, UV light, or X rays), electron-hole pairs are generated and the excited electrons are firmly captured on purposefully introduced trapping states. The mass out-migration of electrons from the ground band leads to the formation of a “satellite valence band” in a high-energy position. Optical pumping with a low- energy incoherent light source at a wavelength of λ1 is then sufficient to extract electrons from this reservoir, followed by electron-hole recombination through an incorporated emitter which is accompanied by the emission of a photon with lower wavelength, λ2. The key feature of this scheme is that the location of the introduced band and the energy gap of the emitter can be rationally tuned. As a result, anti-Stokes emission under incoherent excitation can be obtained, with the added benefits of continuously adjustable frequency shift and broadband excitation. In addition to the anticipated advantage of strongly reduced photo-bleaching during imaging, the approach also overcomes the stringent constraints of the inherently small beam diameter of lasers, thus offering the possibility of rapid optical imaging of tissues over a much larger area.

[Context] However, both the efficacy and affinity of glycine and taurine also strongly depend on the expression system used and can vary up to an order of magnitude when heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells and X. laevis oocytes. Further, the relative efficacy of taurine of heterologous expressed α1 GlyR is directly correlated with its apparent affinity indicating a dependency of taurine-affinity and -efficacy in heterologous expression systems. Interestingly, these results cannot be dismissed as expression system dependent phenomena because the taurine efficacy and affinity similarly varies in magnitude in different brain regions, indicating that mechanisms regulating the efficacy of the partial agonist taurine in the brain are related to differences also seen in heterologous expression systems. However, despite several available crystal structures of glycine receptors and extended kinetic models based on single-channel recordings, so far little is known about the specific conformational rearrangements of the GlyR during receptor activation induced by full and partial agonists and even less which conformations can be adopted during activation in different cell systems.

[Context] The concept of seismic invisibility cloaking device means, for seismic waves, that the considered object (buildings, district, etc.) apparently does not affect the wavefield. Indeed, the high density of deep foundation or ground reinforcement techniques in the urban area, leads researchers to believe there is a significant interaction of these buried structures with a certain component of the seismic signal. A promising way to cause a modification on the seismic disturbance is to create complete artificial anisotropy by implementing geometrical elements, full or empty, in the soil. The physical process is the interference of waves (body or surface waves) scattered from surfaces or objects. The effects of anisotropy are reinforced by the local resonance of implemented elements. these could theoretically lead to an ideal subwavelength cloak detouring waves around a protected area. In these periodic or non-periodic media, the desired effects are total reflection (Bragg’s effect), band-gaps, wave-path control, attenuation by energy-dissipation, amongst others.

[Context] The exact mode of antimicrobial action of quercetin against SM was not completely pictured. Metabolomics affords the chance to achieve a scheme eclectic portrait of biochemical and cellular complexes under well-defined conditions. In recent years, the metabolomics-based approach has been widely applied in the field of drug research to elucidate the mechanism of drug action. Moreover, thorough knowledge of cellular metabolic trepidations during the treatment of antimicrobial agents can facilitate the discovery of innovative drug targets. Here, we performed an untargeted metabolomics investigation to explicate the mechanism of quercetin killing against SM. This is the first study to disclose the metabolic perturbations prompted by quercetin treatment. Our data deliver a novel understanding into the machinery of killing against SM. The traditional pipeline for antimicrobial drug innovation typically originates with in vitro screening of test compounds subsequently imperiling potential hits to in vivo animal testing. Conversely, these prospective compounds frequently turn out unveiling poor pharmacokinetic actions and/or are exceedingly toxic when verified in vivo. To overcome these restrictions, an alternate way is to conduct the preliminary testing of compounds in the C. elegans whole animal system. Revealing worms to both pathogen and test compounds and consequently observing worm survival through the assay can be certainly accomplished as an alternative for antimicrobial screening of test compounds in vivo.
[Question] What are some limitations of the traditional antimicrobial drug discovery pipeline?
Choices:
1. Metabolomics provides a comprehensive portrait of the biochemical and cellular processes under defined conditions. Understanding cellular metabolic changes during antimicrobial treatment can help discover new drug targets.
2. Exposing C. elegans worms to pathogens and test compounds allows preliminary in vivo screening for antimicrobial activity and toxicity before mammalian testing.
3. The data showed for the first time the specific metabolic perturbations caused by quercetin treatment in S. aureus, providing new understanding of its killing mechanism.

[Context] The biological functionality of Ub chains produced in this way has been already successfully demonstrated in an affinity enrichment assay. Along these lines, it has recently been shown that Ub2 based on triazole linkage at the canonic position Lys48 mirrors structural and dynamical features seen for isopeptide Lys48-linked Ub2 very reliably. Using this approach, we are capable to implement segmental isotopic labeling of the proximal Ub moiety within the dimer. Consequently, these species are well suited for high-resolution NMR studies because they avoid potential signal overlap of corresponding resonances originating from both Ub2 units. Hence the structural and dynamic impact which the distal moiety on the proximal site has been precisely probed at a residue-by-residue basis. This has been performed here for the two non-canonically Lys11-, and Lys27-linked Ub2s and – for comparison – for the canonically Lys63-linked Ub2. In combination with structures of the respective isopeptide-linked Ub2s which were obtained from extensive conformational ensembles produced by MD simulations, we propose a model at atomic resolution for the domain-domain orientation between the two moieties of the respective dimers in a solution averaged ensemble. Advantageously, intertwining NMR spectroscopy with MD simulations in this manner avoids additional isotopic labeling and subsequent acquisition of high-resolution NMR data of the residues comprising the distal moiety.
[Question] Why are the triazole-linked Ub2 species well-suited for high-resolution NMR studies?
Choices:
1. The triazole-linked Ub2 allowed segmental isotopic labeling of only the proximal Ub moiety. This avoids signal overlap that would occur from corresponding resonances of both Ub monomers in an isopeptide-linked Ub2. The selective labeling enables residue-specific probing of the impact of the distal Ub on the proximal Ub.
2. The research studied triazole-linked Ub dimers (Ub2) based on Lys11, Lys27, and Lys63 isopeptide linkages. Specifically, a Lys48-linked triazole Ub2 was used as a model for the canonical Lys48 isopeptide linkage.
3. The text states that Ub chains were produced using triazole linkages at the canonical Lys48 position. This allowed segmental isotopic labeling of the proximal Ub moiety within the dimer.
4. NMR spectroscopy was used to study the impact of the distal Ub on the proximal Ub at a per-residue level. This was combined with structural ensembles of the Ub2 dimers obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Together, the NMR and MD data allowed proposing atomic resolution models of the domain-domain orientations in solution.

In healthy individuals, the microbiome influences many physiological functions such as extracting nutrients, maintaining the gut mucosal barrier, training immune cells and protecting against pathogens. Dysbiosis occurs due to loss of beneficial microbes, expansion of pathobionts (opportunistic microbes), or reduction of microbial diversity. Dysbiosis has been associated with human diseases, including IBD, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, autism spectrum disorders, and Clostridioles difficile infection. As the microbiome has been associated with human GI diseases, factors affecting the microbiome in non-human primates (NHP) are being explored, such as species, social structure, environment and diet. Captivity and diets fed to captive marmosets have been associated with microbial diversity loss, shifts in the Firmicutes. Bacteroidetes ratio, and increased GI disease and mortality.

[Question] What scientific techniques does TrAMP draw inspiration from?
Choices:
1. The TrAMP technique enables transient absorption measurements on samples with very low optical densities down to 10-5. It works by passing the pump and probe pulses through the sample multiple times while keeping the time delay between them constant. This amplifies the pump-probe signals by a factor proportional to the number of passes through the sample.
2. TrAMP draws inspiration from absorption spectroscopy of gases, where high sensitivities are achieved by increasing the optical path length through multiple reflections of the light beam inside the gas chamber. TrAMP extends this principle to transient absorption spectroscopy.
3. In TrAMP, the pump and probe pulses pass through the sample multiple times but with the same time delay between them. This increases the number of pump-probe events detected from the sample for each laser shot. Since the signal from each pass is additive, the overall pump-probe signal is amplified by a factor proportional to the number of passes through the sample.
4. Standard pump-probe spectroscopy requires samples to have an optical density above the shot noise limit in order to detect a signal. However, a thin P3HT film of about 5 nm thickness only has an optical density of about 2 × 10-5, which is too low for standard pump-probe techniques to detect a signal above the noise.

[Context] Since the circadian system does not only suffer from the age-related changes but also affects itself on an age-related decline of estrous cyclicity, aging effects on the endocrine system and the circadian system need to be investigated together for a comprehensive understanding of aging in the reproductive system. A computational approach using mathematical modeling is useful to investigate and predict the dynamics of complicated biological systems. Although several mathematical models have been proposed for the ovine and bovine estrous cycle and the human menstrual cycle, none of them takes the circadian regulation of ovulation timing into account. The purposes of the current study are to develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of the circadian-system-regulated estrous cycle of rodents and to examine how variations in parameters involved with hormone production and with circadian phenotypes impact the estrous cyclicity. We finally propose a possible scenario of how aging makes estrous cycles irregular and how altered circadian rhythmicity results in an accelerated aging. Because of the importance of LH to ovulation, our modeling focuses on two aspects of mutual regulation between LH and the circadian system.(1) timing of the LH surge is controlled by the circadian signal originating from the SCN, and (2) LH acts as a synchronizing agent for ovarian circadian oscillators that drive rhythmic ovulatory sensitivity to LH. We demonstrate that parameter variations causing the attenuation of the LH surge, which is a symptom of the reproductive aging, give rise to desynchronization of the ovarian cellular oscillators and a decline of the ovarian sensitivity to LH, resulting in irregular and prolonged estrous cycles. We also show that accelerated aging in circadian clock mutants is at least partly due to misalignment between the SCN and ovarian circadian oscillations, which further reduces synchrony of a population of ovarian cellular oscillators. We thus conclude that the decline of the neural output, which originates from the SCN and is transduced to the ovary as a form of LH surge, causes disorganization of the ovarian circadian system, leading to the irregular estrous cycles.

[Question] What is the effect of Math1 deletion on the structure of intestines?
Choices:
1. Math1 was recently shown to have a tumour suppressor function in colorectal neoplasia. Its function is lost in some patients with colorectal cancer.

[Context] In this work, we report the full-dimensional quantum dynamics study of the dissociative chemisorption of H2O on a rigid Cu(111) surface, allowing all the nine molecular degrees of freedom to be fully coupled. The challenging full-dimensional quantum mechanical calculations not only offer the dynamics features with the highest accuracy, but also allow a conclusive examination of previous dynamical approximations.
[Question] What quantum dynamics method is used in the reported study?
Choices:
1. The reported study uses full-dimensional quantum dynamics to model the dissociative chemisorption of H2O on Cu(111). This means that all nine molecular degrees of freedom of H2O are fully coupled and accounted for in the quantum mechanical calculations. The molecular degrees of freedom refer to the possible motions of the atoms, including stretching, bending, and rotating motions.
2. Full-dimensional quantum dynamics offers the highest accuracy in modeling the dynamics of the dissociative chemisorption process. By including all molecular degrees of freedom, it captures the full complexity of how the breaking of intramolecular bonds couples to the other motions during chemisorption. Approximations that reduce the dimensionality miss important dynamical effects. The full-dimensional calculations also allow previous lower-dimensional approximations to be rigorously examined and validated.
3. The reported work studies the dissociative chemisorption of H2O on a rigid Cu(111) surface. Dissociative chemisorption refers to the process where a molecule chemically bonds to a surface by breaking intramolecular bonds. In this case, H2O bonds to the Cu(111) surface by breaking the bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.
4. The Cu(111) surface is held rigid in order to reduce the computational cost of the full-dimensional quantum calculations. Allowing the surface to move as well would require including the degrees of freedom of the surface atoms. Holding it rigid is an approximation, but a reasonable one based on the fact that the metal surface atoms move much less than the lightweight H2O molecules. The focus is on modeling the dynamics of H2O dissociation.

2. Spinal infection symptoms often have an insidious onset and are non-specific. Additionally, the causative agent cannot be identified in about a third of spinal infection cases, making definitive diagnosis elusive.
3. Imaging modalities used include CT, MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET). CT can evaluate bony changes but may miss early TS without classic findings. MRI with gadolinium is the most reliable for diagnosing spinal infection but has overlap between TS and PS features. PET suggests infection but cannot differentiate between TS and PS.

[Context] In the Endopep-MS assay, each BoNT serotype is detected separately using its own serotype-specific antibodies and a selective peptide substrate. Thus, a suspicious serum sample must be aliquoted for each individual BoNT serotype test. This in turn reduces the sample volume available for each test. Because the assay sensitivity is directly correlated with the amount of BoNT, a limited serum sample might lead to a false negative result. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop an Endopep-MS assay for the simultaneous detection of human related BoNT serotypes. Recently, Wang et al. examined the feasibility of developing such a multiplex Endopep-MS assay for BoNTs A, B, E and F. The authors observed 90% reduced BoNT/A activity in the multiplexed format compared to the single substrate system and demonstrated that this reduced activity was the result of specific inhibition caused by BoNT/E substrate. By contrast, detection of other BoNT types was not reduced by the presence of other peptide substrates in the mixture.

This method assumes that the regional isoscape is constant over the time period of the study and the accuracy and precision of any isoscape-based method depends on the quality of the underlying isoscape.

[Context] It is of great interest to develop an analytical method to design PhC structures that can generate “on-demand” PBGs/CPBGs. Here we develop simple physical rules to design PBGs based on the Bloch mode analysis for periodic structures, suggesting an approach that harnesses complete band gap for all polarizations, with positions tuned by the number of photonic bands below the gap. Our approach directly links three key geometric parameters, namely the number, position, and geometric shape of the resonators, to the PBG properties of PhCs. In this way, the method is able to design structures with nearly optimal PBG sizes between arbitrarily appointed adjacent photonic bands for both TM and TE polarizations without any iterative calculations. More importantly, this method allows one to analytically design PhCs with tunable CPBGs, the position of which is controlled by the number of photonic bands below the gap. With this method, we are able to realize nearly optimal PhC structures composed of two arbitrary materials with dielectric constants ε1 and ε2.

[Context] Third, current studies about the controls on soil CO2–C release have been primarily conducted at high latitudes. our understanding of the magnitude and determinants of CO2–C release in alpine permafrost remains obscured. The Tibetan Plateau is the largest alpine permafrost region around the world, accounting for approximately three quarters of the total area of alpine permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere. During the past 50 years, significant increases in the temperature have caused a 20% decline in the permafrost in this region. In contrast to the large amounts of visible ice contained in high-latitude permafrost deposits, the Tibetan permafrost, especially the upland permafrost, is characterized as being ice-poor as a result of a dry climate with strong solar radiation, wind and high evaporation. Moreover, the Tibetan permafrost has a scarce organic layer, which could increase the thermal conduction from air to the deep permafrost. The lack of an insulation effect provided by the organic layer was considered the main reason for the larger degree of permafrost degradation on the Tibetan Plateau compared with high-latitude permafrost in recent years. Collectively, the distinct climatic and environmental conditions are therefore expected to cause high vulnerability in the C of this permafrost region in response to climate warming. However, a comprehensive understanding of potential C release from Tibetan permafrost remains unavailable.
[Question] How might the characteristics of Tibetan permafrost lead to greater degradation compared to high-latitude permafrost?
[Answer] ","The ice-poor composition and lack of an insulating organic layer mean the Tibetan permafrost has less protection against warming temperatures. The high solar radiation, wind, and evaporation in the region also contribute to greater degradation by promoting warmer and drier conditions.

[Context] Processes developed over the past decades are mainly based on the co-extraction of MA(III) and Ln(III) from HLLW followed by the An(III)/Ln(III) group separation. Firstly, MA and Ln are co-separated from the other FP from high acid (mol/L) HLLW, e. g. the TRPO process using 30% (v/v) mixture of trialkyl phosphine oxides (TRPO) in kerosene, the TRUEX process using [CMPO] = 0.2 M + [TBP] = 1.4 M in n-dodecane, the DIAMEX process using DMDBTDMA or DMDOHEMA in HTP and the DIDPA process using 0.5 M DIDPA-0.1 M TBP in n-dodecane. The oxygen donor ligands, e. g. CMPO, DMDOHEMA, TRPO and DIDPA mentioned above can separate MA(III) and Ln(III) together from fission products in HLLW, but exhibit poor adsorption selectivity between MA(III) and Ln(III). Secondly mutual group separation of MA and Ln are needed, making the integral HLLW separation process very complex. According to the hard and soft acid-base theory, MA(III) and Ln(III) both belong to hard acid, but MA(III) is a little softer than Ln(III) and has better coordination complexation with ligands containing soft coordination atoms N or S. Using ligands containing N or S is expected to achieve the mutual group separation of MA(III) and Ln(III), e. g. BTP (BTBP) and CYANEX 301 used in SANEX, CYANEX 301 processes respectively. Among the various N or S donor ligands, 2,6-bis(5,6-dialkyl-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridines (BTPs) and 6,6’-bis-(5,6-dialkyl-1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)-2,2’-bipyridines (BTBPs) both exhibit high selectivity for MA(III) over Ln(III) in a wide range of nitric acid solutions (HNO3.0.1–4 M, M = mol/L) with the separation factor SF. Am/Eu around 100 and are considered to be a significant breakthrough in MA separation as before that separation MA could be realized only in low acid (pH range).

However, the presently available BTPs used in liquid-liquid extraction suffer from one or more drawbacks, e.

[Context] Lithium-sulfur (Li–S) batteries have been considered as one of the most promising energy storage systems as sulfur cathodes show merits of high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, sulfur suffers from its low intrinsic electronic conductivity, which leads to low active material utilization and unsatisfactory rate performance. In addition, the low density of sulfur also prevents it from achieving high areal/volumetric electrochemical performance in real devices. Selenium (Se) is a chalcogen element that also shows many advantages in electrochemistry. For instance, it has a significantly higher intrinsic conductivity than sulfur (1 × 10 vs.5 × 10 S m) and a similar theoretical volumetric capacity with sulfur (3253 mAh cm for Se, 3467 mAh cm for S, all based on a two-electron transfer chemistry). Unfortunately, the low redox potential of Se cathodes makes them only compatible with alkali metal anodes (Li, Na, and K) to construct non-aqueous Li/Na/K–Se batteries. These batteries not only get limited by the low mass-specific capacity of Se (theoretical value is 675 mAh gSe based on a two-electron transfer chemistry), but suffer from the shuttle effect induced by soluble polyselenides intermediates formed during the charging/discharging process.

[Context] As a particular case of study, here we demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to realize compact photonic crystal cavities on the fiber tip supporting resonant photonic modes. The fabrication process essentially consists of two main steps.(i) FIB milling is first used to create the desired pattern on the fiber facet.(ii) an optically thick high refractive index layer is successively deposited by means of a Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) process. The resulting structure consists of a ‘double-layer’ photonic crystal slab supporting guided resonances. The excited photonic modes, having most of their energy concentrated in the dielectric layer which is typically lossless in the VIS-NIR wavelength range, have longer propagation lengths than plasmonic modes, thus leading to a large Q factor. The possibility to excite electromagnetic waves strongly confined within the slab and yet capable of coupling to the external radiation, provides an effective and appealing way to sense the external environment. Some studies have demonstrated that sensitivity associated to photonic modes may results higher than that associated to plasmonic modes.

[Context] Hedgehog (Hh) was originally discovered in the early 1980s in Drosophila by Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus. Binding among Indian hedgehog (IHH), Sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Desert hedgehog (DHH) ligands attenuates the suppressive effect of their Patched (PTCH) transmembrane proteins/receptors on Smoothened (SMO), which is also located in the cell membrane. The signaling cascade initiated by SMO culminates in the activation and nuclear deployment of GLI gene transcription elements, thus inducing the expression of Hh target genes. the majority of these genes are involved in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. The Hh signaling (HhS) pathway is aberrantly activated by overexpression of Hh ligands, loss of receptor function, or dysregulation of transcription factors. Evidence suggests that The constitutive activation of the HhS pathway is definitely linked to the onset and progression of several types of cancer, such as lung, gastric, prostate, hepatocellular, pancreatic, colorectal, esophageal, and ovarian cancers. Moreover, evidence shows that multiple uroepithelial cancer cell lines exhibit constitutive HhS. Given the functional significance of HhS in cancer and its crucial role in the disease, novel strategies targeting this pathway seem to hold promising therapeutic options for bladder cancer treatment. However, the current comprehension of the function of HhS in the bladder cancer molecular landscape is incomplete.
[Question] How does the Hedgehog signaling pathway work?
Choices:
1. Studies show that constitutive activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, through overexpression of Hh ligands, loss of PTCH receptor function, or dysregulation of GLI transcription factors, is linked to the onset and progression of various cancers including lung, gastric, prostate, hepatocellular, pancreatic, colorectal, esophageal, and ovarian cancers. Evidence also shows that multiple uroepithelial cancer cell lines exhibit constitutive Hh signaling.
2. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling refers to a signaling pathway that was originally discovered in the 1980s by Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus through studies in the fruit fly Drosophila. They found a gene that affected the segmentation pattern of fly larvae, which they named 'hedgehog'. Further studies revealed a conserved Hh signaling pathway in vertebrates including mammals.
3. Since the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is functionally significant in cancer development and progression, inhibiting or modulating this pathway may offer new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Given its crucial role, novel therapies targeting Hh signaling components seem to hold promise as options for treating cancers dependent on aberrant Hh signaling.
4. In the absence of Hh ligands, the Patched (PTCH) receptors suppress the activity of Smoothened (SMO). When Hh ligands bind PTCH, this suppression is relieved, allowing SMO to activate a signaling cascade. This leads to activation and nuclear translocation of the GLI transcription factors. GLI induces expression of Hh target genes, many of which regulate proliferation, survival and angiogenesis.

We conduct an unbiased approach by investigating NRF2-dependent transcriptome in NSCLC cell lines with KEAP1 mutations (NRF2-activated NSCLCs) and in those with an intact KEAP1-NRF2 system (NRF2-normal NSCLCs). We identify a battery of genes that are regulated by NRF2 specifically in NRF2-activated NSCLCs and found that these genes are accompanied by unique NRF2-dependent enhancers. CEBPB accumulation in NRF2-activated NSCLCs is found to be one of the prerequisites for the establishment of the unique enhancers, in which NOTCH3 enhancer is critical for the promotion of tumor-initiating activity. Clinical data indeed show that NOTCH3 contributes to cancer malignancy selectively in NRF2-activated NSCLCs, strongly suggesting pathological significance of the NRF2-NOTCH3 axis.

3. pHrodo is a fluorescent dye that senses changes in pH across the physiologic range from pH 4 to 8. It does this by exhibiting increased fluorescence intensity as the pH decreases across this range. This allows it to sense the acidic environment inside phagosomes and endosomes when delivered into cells through vehicles like SAFs.
4. A low-molecular-weight amphiphilic molecule was synthesized that can self-assemble into fibrous hydrogels and physically encapsulate pHrodo dye without needing to chemically modify the dye. SAF particles of an appropriate size were then isolated from the bulk hydrogel to maximize uptake into cells through endocytosis or phagocytosis.

In fact, by using this feature, the TGW bound is used to upper bound the quantum capacity and the private capacity of the lossy optical channel. This is notable because it is intractable to estimate the quantum capacity and the private capacity in general, owing to possibly non-additive nature of quantum channels. On the other hand, Pirandola, Laurenza, Ottaviani and Banchi (PLOB) have succeeded in determining the quantum capacity and the private capacity of the lossy optical channel, via finding out the teleportation stretchability of the lossy optical channel and deriving an upper bound—called PLOB bound—applied to any teleportation stretchable quantum channel. In terms of the communication efficiency described by obtained ebits or secret bits per used optical mode, the PLOB bound is, at most, twice as tight as the TGW bound for lossy optical channels.

[Context] Thiaminase I-induced thiamine deficiency has been commonly treated for many decades in domestic animals as diverse as sheep and fish through thiamine supplementation. Still, the variable circumstances leading to thiamine deficiency in these organisms have remained perplexing. As thiaminase I requires a nucleophilic co-substrate for thiamine degradation, it is not only the enzyme levels but also the concentrations and identities of endogenous co-substrates that dictate l enzyme activity. Prior studies indicated that adding pyridine, an exogenous co-substrate, to fecal samples of lambs and whole blood samples of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) increased their thiaminase activity. This indicated that insufficient levels of endogenous co-substrates were present in the samples to support maximal activity of the thiaminase I and supplementation with saturating concentrations of exogenous substrates allowed the maximum possible thiaminase I activity. This suggests that thiamine-degrading activity by thiaminase I is influenced by dietary substrate composition and the thiamine degradation that is maximally possible with a co-substrate replete diet. In other studies, prolonged exposure was required to reproduce the symptoms of thiamine deficiency in hatchery fish consuming food with depleted thiamine content from the addition of P. thiaminolyticus. Similarly, we noted an unexpected resilience of mammalian skeletal muscle cells in culture depleted of thiamine using recombinant thiaminase from C. botulinum. These observations prompted our inquiry into the efficiency of thiamine depletion and understanding of thiaminase-mediated thiamine depletion in complex matrices.

[Context] In comparison to the NM/FM bilayers, where SOT switching and sensing using USMR have both been confirmed, the observation of USMR in TI/FM systems has not been reported yet. In a very recent study, large unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR), which behaves similarly as USMR in terms of longitudinal electrical properties has been observed in magnetic TIs. however, it is attributed to a different physical mechanism, namely the asymmetric scattering of electrons by magnons. This UMR is observed in Cr. x.(Bi1−ySb. y.)2−xTe3/(Bi1−ySb. y.)2Te3 heterostructures at very low temperatures (from 2 K up to 30 K). Although both USMR and UMR could play the same role of detecting magnetization in a two-terminal SOT switching device, the practical applicability of UMR in magnetic TIs is constrained by the low Curie temperature in these materials. Consequently, the UMR decays rapidly above 30 K in these systems. On the other hand, for more pragmatic applications, it is desirable to explore the USMR phenomenon in heterostructures that interface a TI with a conventional FM of technological relevance.
[Question] What are the materials used to observe UMR? What are the temperature constraints for UMR?
Choices:
1. Some conventional FM materials that could be explored are Iron, Cobalt, Nickel and their alloys, which have high Curie temperatures. Interfacing these with a TI in a heterostructure could potentially lead to the observation of USMR at room temperature.
2. Conventional FMs used in real devices generally have higher Curie temperatures than the magnetic TIs where UMR is seen. Exploring USMR in TI/FM heterostructures could lead to more practical room temperature applications utilizing the unidirectional magnetoresistance effects.
3. UMR is attributed to asymmetric scattering of electrons by magnons, while USMR originates from the spin-orbit coupling and spin Hall effect. They have similar longitudinal electrical properties, but different underlying physical mechanisms.

[Question] What is photon trapping and how does it enhance light absorption?
Choices:
1. Anti-reflection refers to reducing the reflection of light off the surface of a material, so that more light can transmit into the material. This increases the fraction of incident light that enters and gets absorbed rather than reflected off the surface.
2. Light harvesting refers to enhancement of absorbed light via either photon trapping or anti-reflection (AR), leading to an increase in the fraction of available light that can be utilized.
3. Photon trapping refers to confining light within a material structure so that the optical path length is increased. This increases the probability of the photons being absorbed and thereby enhances the light absorption.
4. Nanostructures can exhibit excellent absorption properties in the visible region via light harvesting, when their dimensions are comparable to the wavelength of light in the visible range.

Despite these early studies have been done almost three decades ago, the mentioned metastability nature of c-GaN and the Mg doping drawbacks have caused disperse and limited information on the electrical properties of Mg-doped cubic GaN. Recently the authors in reference reported a free hole concentration in the order of 10 cm in c-GaN. No subsequent study could be found where hole concentration is in the order of 10 cm or larger. Thus, further research is necessary to achieve a better understanding of the Mg doping of c-GaN.

Chemosynthetic polyesters, i. e. poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL), poly(butylene succinate) (PBSu), and poly(butylene adipate-co-butylene terephthalate) (PBAT) have also been developed as biodegradable polymers since the latter part of the twentieth century, and some of them are manufactured from biomass and used commercially. Natural polymers are also used as biodegradable polymers with or without the modification. For instance, starch modified by glycerol or chemosynthetic polymers, i. e. PCL, and cellulose partially esterified with fatty acid are thermoplastic and biodegradable. The poor mechanical and thermal properties of commercially available biodegradable polymers limit their adoption. Therefore, these biodegradable polymers have only been used as alternatives to general-purpose polymers. PLA, which has a relatively high glass transition temperature (Tg), flexural strength, and flexural modulus i. e.60 °C, 80–100 MPa, and 3 GPa, is used for applications requiring rigid material. However, the biodegradation of PLA is limited to high-temperature compost environments, and PLA does not show biodegradability in the natural environment.

[Context] For many years, liver or combined liver and heart transplantation were the only palliative treatments for the TTR amyloidoses. More recently, it has been shown that small molecules able to bind to the TTR T4-binding sites increase the energy barrier of tetramer dissociation, acting as kinetic stabilizers, thus stalling TTR aggregation. A pharmacologic strategy, based on stabilization of the TTR native tetramer by the benzoxazole tafamidis has been approved in Europe and Japan for the treatment of early-stage FAP. However, tafamidis might not be potent enough to treat advanced TTR amyloidoses. The lack of an Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved candidate for the treatment of TTR amyloidoses reflects the difficulty of moving from the discovery of in vitro hits to the development of clinically effective and safe drugs. Drug repositioning offers a potentially valuable and productive approach to identify candidates for new pharmacologic applications. The process involves the identification of existing compounds licensed for a different therapeutic indication. Those candidates have already established safety profiles, reducing the time and cost required to bring them to trial and into the clinic for their new indication. Diflunisal, an FDA-approved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, acts as a TTR kinetic stabilizer. Although its in vitro affinity for TTR T4-binding sites is significantly lower than that of tafamidis, a randomized clinical trial has shown that the diflunisal treatment of patients with FAP for 2 years reduced the rate of progression of neurological impairment, demonstrating the validity of drug repurposing for TTR amyloidoses.

This is because the QM data points used in force-field optimization are mainly static quantities like ground/intermediate/transition-state structures and energies. For more accurate RMD simulations of far-from-equilibrium reaction dynamics, we here propose a dynamic approach, where ReaxFF parameters are calibrated by directly fitting RMD trajectories against quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) trajectories on the fly. This dynamic approach is implemented using MOGA to optimize the ReaxFF model in terms of multiple quantities of interest (QoI). MOGA uses a non-dominated sorting algorithm to sort out a population of ReaxFF models into different sets called Pareto optimal fronts, such that every set contains models non-dominated by each other in terms of accuracy of the QoI.

[Context] Conformational flexibility and dynamics of the DNA-nanogold conjugates limit the structural determination by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and single-particle cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) reconstruction because they do not crystallize, are not sufficiently small for nuclear magnetic resonance studies and cannot be classified into a limited number of classes for single-particle EM reconstruction. In addition, three-dimensional (3D) structure averaged from tens of thousands of different macromolecular particles obtained without prior knowledge of the macromolecular structural flexibility could result in an absence of flexible domains upon using the single-particle reconstruction method, for example, two ankyrin repeated regions of TRPV1 were absent in its atomic resolution 3D density map.
[Question] What are two limitations of using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of DNA-nanogold conjugates?
Choices:
1. Methods are being developed to classify flexible molecules into different structural states and to determine ""ensemble"" structures representing multiple conformations. Advanced computational methods can also model missing flexible regions based on lower-resolution data.
2. First, DNA-nanogold conjugates are too large for conventional NMR structural studies, which are generally limited to smaller molecules. Second, their conformational flexibility results in broad NMR signals that are difficult to interpret in structural terms.

[Context] To avoid the creation of an energy and/or GHG sink, in general, the growth of the industry should be limited by 1/PBT, where PBT (payback time) is the time in which upfront investments in either CED or GHG emissions are paid back. However, energy and GHG sinks from periods of growth exceeding 1/PBT can be offset by decreased growth rates (or decreasing PBT) in later stages. Thus, the dynamics of growth need to be taken into account, rather than always aiming for a 1/PBT limited growth, as is discussed by Emmott et al. The concept of the PV industry as an energy sink, and more recently GHG sink is well known in the PV community. Grimmer et al. have been one of the first to address this issue in terms of energy, stating that to maximise the (positive) impact of solar technologies, they should have short energy payback time (EPBT) and long lifetime. When the growth of the PV industry started to accelerate, others indicated the necessity of strong decreases in energy payback time. Others have also analysed the relation between industry growth and EPBT and concluded that for mono-crystalline PV, a sustainable growth rate should be limited to around 7% (ref.), however this result was based on a static measurement of the energy footprint of PV systems, and thus did not account for the decrease of the energy footprint of PV systems over time. More recent studies have also analysed GHG sinks.
[Question] Why can't the PV industry growth rate always be limited to 1/PBT?
[Answer] ","The text explains that strictly limiting growth to 1/PBT does not account for the dynamics of PV industry growth over time. As technology improves, the PBT decreases, so the allowable growth rate could increase. Also, periods of faster-than-1/PBT growth can be offset by slower growth rates later on. Therefore, a rigid 1/PBT limit is not always optimal.","1/PBT growth limits are too restrictive for PV. As PV systems improve, their energy footprint decreases over time. So a 1/PBT limit would impede innovation. Sustainable ~7% growth rate was suggested as balance between energy sinks and GHG offsets. More recent studies analyze GHG sinks as well. But the industry should aim to offset energy and GHG sinks. This requires careful growth",0.0967741935483871,gen,True

[Context] Even when present at low levels, Cl radicals can have a profound impact on tropospheric oxidation and radical cycling. Cl chemistry can significantly impact levels of tropospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas that is also a precursor for the OH radical, destroying it in clean environments and enhancing its formation under polluted conditions. Additionally, much faster rates of reaction, in comparison to OH, allow Cl radicals to expedite oxidation of climate-active gases, such as methane (CH4) and dimethyl sulphide. The introduction of reactive chlorine into the troposphere is understood to occur mainly via heterogeneous processes on particulate surfaces, typically sea salt, which release particle bound chlorine into the gas phase. The main mechanisms for chlorine release are (i) displacement of particulate hydrochloric acid by nitric or sulfuric acid, (ii) photochemical production of molecular chlorine on aerosol surfaces, and, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), (iii) formation of nitryl chloride (ClNO2) by uptake of N2O5 on the surface of chlorine containing aerosols at night. Once thought to be restricted to the marine and polar boundary layer, recent observations have found that chlorine radicals also play a significant role in coastal urban and even mid-continental areas, believed to be a result of mechanism (iii). While Cl radical concentrations approaching 10 Cl cm have been reported, the global average marine boundary layer concentration is estimated to be about 10 Cl cm, with Cl chemistry generally considered minor on the global scale.
[Question] Where was reactive chlorine previously thought to be restricted to, and what recent observations challenge this?
Choices:
1. Reactive chlorine radicals were previously thought to be restricted to the marine and polar boundary layer. However, recent observations have found that chlorine radicals also play a significant role in coastal urban and even mid-continental areas. This is believed to be a result of mechanism (iii), the nocturnal formation of nitryl chloride, which can occur away from marine environments.
2. The introduction of reactive chlorine into the troposphere is understood to occur mainly via heterogeneous processes on particulate surfaces, typically sea salt. This releases particle-bound chlorine into the gas phase through three primary mechanisms: (i) displacement of particulate hydrochloric acid by nitric or sulfuric acid, (ii) photochemical production of molecular chlorine on aerosol surfaces, and (iii) formation of nitryl chloride (ClNO2) by uptake of N2O5 on chlorine containing aerosol surfaces at night, especially in polluted areas with high nitrogen oxides (NOx).
3. The global average marine boundary layer concentration of chlorine radicals is estimated to be about 10^4 chlorine atoms per cubic cm, although concentrations approaching 10^5 Cl/cm^3 have been reported in some locations. Overall chlorine chemistry is generally considered minor on the global scale.

[Question] What is ion rectification and how does it work?
Choices:
1. Polyelectrolyte heterojunctions are analogues of semiconductor p-n junctions for ion flow. When two oppositely charged polyelectrolytes are brought together, an ionic double layer (IDL) forms at the junction. The IDL allows easier transport of counterions while blocking co-ions. This asymmetric ion selectivity results in rectification of the ionic current.
2. Some examples include nanopores/nanochannels made of heterogeneous surfaces, polyelectrolyte heterojunctions, and ionoelastomer heterojunctions. Specific examples are the agarose-based hydrogel diode made by Cayre et al. and the poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)/poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) diode made by Han et al. The ionic rectification occurs due to the asymmetric ionic double layer generated at the junction.
3. An electrolytic diode produces rectification through asymmetric faradaic reactions at the electrodes and is based on electron flow. An ionic diode works by asymmetric ion transport through the structure itself and does not rely on redox reactions. The ionic diode controls ion flow analogous to how a semiconductor p-n junction controls electron flow.
4. Ion rectification occurs when ions are transported asymmetrically through a structure, resulting in nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) curves. This happens when ions are either trapped or transported selectively through an asymmetric heterojunction structure. The asymmetry causes the preferential flow of ions in one direction over another.

Using the fabricated Pt nanowires/TiO2 catalytic nanodiode, we report the in situ detection of charge flow as steady-state chemicurrent generated by gas-phase catalytic methanol oxidation on the Pt nanowire catalysts supported on TiO2. To find the dynamics of reaction-induced hot electrons on the metal-oxide interface, the results of partial oxidation selectivity and chemicurrent on Pt nanowires/TiO2 were compared with the results of the Pt film/TiO2 Schottky nanodiode whose metal-oxide interface was not exposed to the environment of the gas-phase chemical reaction. We showed that formed nanoscale Pt-TiO2 interface gives rise to the higher selectivity of methyl formate, thereby hot electrons were excited much more on the Pt-TiO2 interface, as the hot electron generation was affected by selectivity under methanol oxidation. Comparing the simulation results by density functional theory (DFT) from the two models of Pt nanorod on TiO2(110) and Pt(111), we could support the increase in selectivity at the Pt-TiO2 interface due to the difference of activation barrier.

[Context] Herein, we demonstrate an efficient 3D printing approach by using ketocoumarin as the photosensitizer (also a reactive light absorber), attributed to (1) ketocoumarins are attractive and distinct photosensitizers with high molar extinction coefficients and high intersystem crossing coefficients, which would promote the light energy efficiency, photoinitiating efficiency, and print speed, (2) ketocoumarins exhibit high photochemical stability in a solidified polymer to prevent photobleaching and thus can afford a low light penetration depth, which would help increasing the print resolution, and (3) ketocoumarins would generate products with high molar extinction coefficients after photoreaction, which help boosting the print resolution as well. To demonstrate a proof of concept, we used one ketocoumarin compound, i. e., 3,3′-carbonylbis(7-diethylaminocoumarin) (KCD), as the photosensitizer for efficient 3D printing. Excitingly, an attractive print speed (5.1 cm h) and high print resolution (23 μm) were simultaneously achieved on a common bottom-up 3D printer. Furthermore, the light energy efficiency increased 12 times in comparison with traditional systems based on nonreactive light absorbers. Deep insight into the mechanism shows that the photoreaction process of KCD significantly matters for controlling the 3D printing resolution and only the photooxidation process can enable well-defined 3D printing. The initiating radical and deethylated ketocoumarin were simultaneously generated during the photooxidation of KCD. The initiating radical triggered a rapid photopolymerization for facile 3D printing, while the deethylated ketocoumarin ensured high print resolution by confining the light penetration. By comparison, the printed feature could not be identifiable when KCD encountered photoreduction. These findings would open a new door to design efficient additive manufacturing by controlling the photoreaction processes of photosensitizers during photopolymerization.

[Context] In previous work, we demonstrated the ability of single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to quantify the adsorption and diffusion of surfactant probes at the solid–liquid interface in an effort to understand fundamental dynamic interfacial behaviour. In this paper, we turn this approach upside down, and use the trajectories of probe molecules (BODIPY-labelled dodecanoic acid) to provide images based on the lateral heterogeneity of probe–surface interactions. Importantly, we use the absolute physical properties of these interactions to map a surface, rather than arbitrary photon or point counts. We call this new approach mapping using accumulated probe trajectories (MAPT). To implement mapping based on the dynamic details of molecular trajectories, an enormous leap was required in terms of the number of trajectories analyzed, from ~10, in a typical single-molecule tracking experiment, to 10–10. This was achieved by developing efficient, high-throughput computational methods, which enabled us to extract quantitative information from massive data sets. After obtaining maps of several dynamic probe properties (adsorption rate, interfacial mobility, occupancy, desorption probability), we directly relate these physical properties back to 'calibration' data from uniform surfaces to identify the specific hydrophobicity associated with each region. This demonstration system (where hydrophobic interactions are the dominant interaction) allows us to make direct connections between standard macroscale measurements of hydrophobicity (contact angle) and small-scale probe–surface interactions of the MAPT technique. We also demonstrate that spatial features can be identified at super-resolution length scales.
[Question] What new imaging approach is introduced in this work?
Choices:
1. The probe molecule used was BODIPY-labelled dodecanoic acid. This fluorophore-labelled fatty acid allows the trajectories at the solid-liquid interface to be visualized using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM).
2. Previous single-molecule tracking experiments typically analyzed around 10 trajectories. The MAPT approach required analyzing a much larger number of trajectories, from 10 to 10^10, in order to accumulate sufficient data for mapping. This was enabled by developing efficient computational methods to extract quantitative data from massive trajectory datasets.
3. For the demonstration system based on hydrophobic interactions, the MAPT data was correlated to macroscale hydrophobicity measurements (contact angle). This provided a link between the molecular-scale interactions observed with MAPT and standard wetting measurements.

[Question] How did the deformation response time of the composite gel compare to that of a typical PNIPA gel volume phase transition?
[Answer] ",The deformation response time of the composite gel was on the order of seconds for a ~1 mm gel size. This was faster than the response time of a typical PNIPA gel volume phase transition.,2. The response time of the deformation was in the order of seconds for a ~1 mm size composite gel. This is much faster than the long response time associated with volume phase transitions. So the composite gel responded much more quickly compared to a typical volume phase transition PNIPA gel. This is due to the alignment of nanosheets and parallel layering. The aligned nanosheets and stacked layers allowed the gel to deform while maintaining its volume.,0.38181818181818183,gen,True

[Context] In this work, we introduce p-n heterojunction diodes fabricated by transferring vapor phase grown n-type MoS2 thin films onto p-type silicon (p-Si) substrates. Previously, we created high quality diodes by transferring monolayer graphene onto pre-patterned silicon substrates. In a similar fashion, MoS2 layers of varying thicknesses are transferred forming a vertical hybrid device. This design allows the MoS2 film to be directly exposed to light. The effect of varying the incident light intensity, wavelength and MoS2 film thickness was investigated. The devices reported here display extraordinary sensitivity to changes in illumination. The spectral response showed a very broad spectrum with contributions from indirect and direct band gap transitions. Further, we report an extension of the spectrum into the visible range.
[Question] What materials were used to create the p-n heterojunction in the diodes?
Choices:
1. The p-n heterojunction was created using n-type MoS2 thin films and p-type silicon (p-Si) substrates. Specifically, the n-type MoS2 thin films were transferred onto the p-type silicon substrates to form the p-n heterojunction.

[Context] This study shows that the simple device current of a polymer diode can contain such information on spin entanglement of site-separated spins. We employ the widely used conducting polymer PEDOT. PSS as the active material due to its comparatively low density of hydrogen nuclei from which carriers are shielded effectively. At low temperatures, when the acceptor sites bind mobile holes, conduction gives way to a semiconducting state possessing conventional diode-like rather than Ohmic current–voltage characteristics. We use very short (ns range), powerful (kW range) coherent microwave pulses to coherently drive magnetic resonant spin-Rabi nutation in the carrier-pair spin manifold and monitor the resulting oscillation of free charge-carrier density in the device. Such an experiment is known as pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance (pEDMR). Spin-beat oscillations of the Rabi nutations of the two charge carriers develop as each partner of the coupled pair is coherently but differently driven in the resonant electromagnetic field. This beat oscillation leads to an effective doubling in precession frequency. The spin–spin interaction strength due to exchange and magnetic-dipolar coupling becomes quantifiable by measuring the precise variation in Rabi beat frequencies while detuning the system from its resonance condition. The exact quantification of the precession frequency components under detuning has previously been hampered by the significant hyperfine interactions common to organic semiconductors. This limitation necessitates an appropriate choice of material system for unambiguously demonstrating the use of detuned spin-beat Rabi oscillations as a spectroscopic technique to quantify zero-field splitting within the pair. Here we use two methods to constrain the spin–spin interaction strengths. first, through comparison of our measurements with the analytical solution for correlated spin-pair precession in the limit of weak coupling (that is, J=D=0, with J the exchange energy and D the dipolar coupling).
[Question] Why was PEDOT.PSS chosen as the active material?

[Context] This is because the observation of TME effect requires the Fermi energy within the magnetic mass-gap on the surface Dirac cone, and hence precise Fermi energy tuning is indispensable.

[Question] Why is the observation of a genuine TME signal limited to low energies?
[Answer] ","The observation of a genuine TME signal is limited to energies that are sufficiently lower than the magnetic mass-gap. This avoids responses coming from real electronic transitions across the mass-gap. At energies much lower than the gap, the observed signal can be confidently attributed to the TME effect rather than transitions.","1) The text explains that precise Fermi energy tuning is indispensable for observing the TME effect, because the Fermi energy must be within the magnetic mass-gap on the surface Dirac cone. 2) The text states that the observation of a genuine TME signal is limited to energies sufficiently lower than the magnetic mass-gap, because responses from real electronic transitions could obscure the TME signal if the energy is too high.",0.35772357723577236,gen,True

[Context] In this study, we found that increased selectivity in the Eastern Baltic cod fishery leads to higher abundance in non-fishable size groups, leading in turn to lower individual growth. With new recruits entering the population, the lower growth induces crowding in smaller, non-fishable size groups, further decreasing growth potential. Meanwhile, as fishing mortality increases in larger fish groups, the rate of culling by cannibalism between size groups can be expected to be reduced, further aggravating the situation. We reproduce these findings by a model using real estimates on recruitment, L∞, mortality rates and selectivity. We argue that the link between higher selectivity and induction of individual density-dependent growth may have implications on MSY-based approaches, in particular when increased selection on larger size classes is an important part of the management strategy.
[Question] What causes the lower individual growth seen in the non-fishable size groups when their abundance increases?
Choices:
1. As fishing mortality increases in the larger, fishable size groups, it reduces the overall number of mature cod. With fewer mature cod, the rate of cannibalism on smaller cod is reduced.
2. The increased abundance and density of the non-fishable cod leads to crowding. This crowding induces competition for resources like food and space. With more cod competing for limited resources, the growth potential for individual cod decreases.
3. Increased selectivity means the fishery is targeting and catching more of the larger, mature cod. This reduces the number of mature cod that are left to prey on the smaller, non-fishable cod through cannibalism. With less cannibalism, more of the smaller cod survive and their abundance increases.
4. The study used a model with real estimates for parameters like recruitment, mortality rates, L-infinity, and selectivity. This model was able to reproduce the same findings seen in the fishery, confirming the link between higher selectivity and individual growth reduction through density-dependence.

[Context] In all mitochondrial compartments, proteostasis is accomplished by the AAA+ family of proteases that capture energy from ATP to catalyse protein degradation. Multiple subunits assemble to form a peptidase chamber bearing narrow entrances that require substrate proteins to be unfolded before entry. Substrate unfolding is catalysed by a ring of AAA+ ATPase domains that stack upon the peptidase chamber and select which proteins within a crowded cellular environment are delivered to the peptidase for degradation (). Upon binding to a substrate, ATP-driven conformational fluctuations in the AAA+ ring deliver an unfolding force to the substrate followed by translocation of the unfolded polypeptide into the peptidase chamber. Substrate interaction is commonly achieved by the recognition of degradation signals (degrons) present within the substrate. Degrons can take the form of specific amino acid sequences found at either terminus or internally within the polypeptide (for example, the bacterial ssrA tag), defined structural architectures (for example, the tetrameric arrangement of the Mu transposase complex) or covalently linked accessory proteins (for example, polyubiquitin recognition by the 26S proteasome). Understanding protein degradation by a AAA+ protease requires probing both the affinity of the protease for the degron to achieve satisfactory substrate binding and the ability of the protease to apply sufficient force to initiate unfolding.

[Context] Despite the implementation of goal-directed care (fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, source control and vasopressors), severe sepsis and septic shock are the most common cause of death in intensive care units. An excessive host response associated with a non-resolving systemic inflammatory response syndrome contributes to the pathogenesis of sepsis. Among the common bacterial causes of sepsis are Gram-negative bacilli. A major component of Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induces the secretion and release of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-1β and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). In contrast to early proinflammatory cytokines (for example, TNF and IL-1β), HMGB1 is released in a delayed manner by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Macrophages can efficiently release HMGB1, particularly when the initial LPS priming is accompanied by a second stimulus such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Once released, HMGB1 binds to cell-surface receptors (for example, toll-like receptors and receptor for advanced glycation end products) and propagates the inflammatory response.

[Context] Drops hitting superhydrophobic surfaces can bounce off quickly because of the low friction between drop and the substrate, either at the end of retraction or at their maximum extension in a pancake shape. Normally the drop retains a circular symmetry during the bouncing and the contact time is bounded below by the Rayleigh limit. However, Bird et al. showed that drops impacting on surfaces where asymmetry is introduced with ridges, an order of magnitude smaller than the drop, leave the surface with shortened contact time. Moreover, the contact time of drops bouncing on a superhydrophobic macrotexture can take discrete values depending on the drop impact point relative to the texture and its impact velocity. The left–right symmetry can be also broken by imposing a surface gradient to induce a directional movement or by considering impacts on a moving surface.

The mechanism by which ABA treats acidosis is shown in. ABA forms a bivalent complex with lactate and thereby decreases the intracellular lactate concentration, shifting the equilibrium towards the production of more lactate, resulting in the consumption of protons via hydrogenation of pyruvate. Importantly, ABA is specific for lactate over other metabolites such as glucose, because of its ortho-hydroxyl, which prevents it from binding cis-diols. In addition, ABA also increases the NAD/NADH ratio, which also has numerous therapeutic effects, such as protection against apoptosis and suppression of inflammation.

[Context] The interaction between different degrees of freedom in coupled molecular systems—electrons, nuclei and phonons—dictate many of their most important physical properties. For instance, electron–phonon interactions underlie the carrier properties of a wide range of promising light harvesting materials including hybrid perovskites, organic crystals that undergo singlet fission and quantum-confined nanostructures. In natural systems, interactions between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom may have important implications for rapid and efficient energy transfer. Despite tremendous effort, revealing these interactions experimentally has proved extremely challenging. For instance, the physical origins of some coherent phenomena observed in photosynthetic pigment–protein complexes using two-dimensional Fourier-transform (2DFT) spectroscopy remain elusive, partly due to the ambiguity of spectral signatures arising from related signal pathways.

[Context] The most commonly used probe as indicator of intracellular oxidative stress is 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). It is a good indicator of hydroxyl radicals (HO), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxyl radicals (ROO). It can diffuse through the cellular membrane and it is naturally hydrolyzed by endogenous cell esterases removing diacetate groups and forming 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH). Then, non-fluorescent DCFH originates 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by indirect reactions with iron, heme proteins, GS, CO3, NO2, HO, and H2O2 (). DCF is a fluorescent compound that can be detected by absorbance spectroscopy at 500 nm (ε = 59500 M cm) and fluorescence spectroscopy at λemission = 522 nm and λexcitation = 498 nm.

[Context] After a biomaterial implantation, the body’s immune system is activated to protect the host against infections and tissue damage, additionally complicated with a foreign body reaction and surface deposition of various biomolecules and proteins such as albumin. Leukocytes increase their consumption of oxygen by using the respiratory burst to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), lactic acid, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and its derivatives, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl) into the extracellular medium. For bone tissue, osteoclasts also express HCl which together creates an oxidative acidic environment with pH decrease from neutral to 5 and lower during inflammation. In the severe inflammatory condition, neutrophils, macrophages, and microorganisms can create a very oxidative and acidic medium with pH ⁓ 2–3 surroundings the implant, even sufficient to dissolve very resistant materials such as gold. The passive protective film on titanium in these conditions start to undergo degradation, accelerating corrosion rate and causing surface roughening and formation of intensely hydrated porous TiOOH compound. Recent studies showed that the combination of albumin and H2O2 accelerated the corrosion rate of CP-Ti and Ti–6Al–4V and the presence of lactic acid and H2O2 decreased the corrosion resistance considerably. As a result of the complicated in vivo environment, corrosion of Ti implants can be considerably accelerated, resulting in a significantly shorter implant life and higher risk of failures. Therefore, proper alloying additives to high-performance titanium alloys are required to prevent implant failures in inflammatory conditions. Silicon has been introduced to some Ti-based alloys, but it has not yet been sufficiently analyzed when added to the Ti–Nb–Zr system. So, there is an interest to assess as Ti–Nb–Zr–Si alloy for potential material for orthopaedic applications.

[Context] The integer QH effect occurs when a two-dimensional (2D) electron system is subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field.The metrological precision of the Hall conductance is understood in terms of the topological invariant of the Chern number associated with the Berry connection.The precise quantization of the Hall conductance is related to the absence of backscattering in topologically protected chiral one-dimensional edge states with opposite momentum directions at the device boundaries.Imaging of QH edge states has been challenging due to their limited spatial extent and their location at the boundaries of the quantum Hall system.A number of notable attempts include.scanning gate microscopy, scanning single-electron transistor (SET) measurements, scanning force microscopy, scanning charge accumulation, and scanning microwave impedance microscopy.More recent intriguing progress in imaging quantum Hall edge states has been made using SQUID-on-tip measurements of graphene, however, the authors were not successful in imaging any broken-symmetry states inside the graphene zLL as the technique is limited to a moderate magnetic field range..

[Context] The group b crystals contain the Q silicates as well as covalent O-H bonds and HBs. In this group, only Afwillite contains water molecules. These crystals have a broadly dispersed Si-O BO although with well-defined narrowly ranged BL. The lower Si-O BO is generally associated with the Si-OH (hydroxyl) bond, while the higher BO with Si-O bonds within the tetrahedral unit. The Ca-O BO in group b crystals is significantly smaller and shows a narrow distribution over a wide range of BL. Further, the covalent O-H bonds and HBs exhibit a wide range of BO and BL as expected. For all the crystals in this group, the contributions from Ca-O, O-H bonds and HBs to the TBO are almost 50% or more. For example, in Afwillite (b1), the contributions to the TBO are as follows. Si-O (48.2%), Ca-O (28.6%), O-H (14.1%) and O···H (8.7%). Here the covalent O-H bonds are connected to the silicate tetrahedral units [HSiO4] through HBs whose BLs varies between 1.38–1.98 Å with significant BO values. Therefore, the -O···H contribution in Afwillite is the highest (8.71%) in this group. Rastsvetaeva et al., in their IR spectrum analyses of Afwillite, have assigned the characteristic vibrational modes of the so-called zundel cation (H2-O···H···OH2), or (H5O2). However, in our BO analysis, we do not observe this zundel cation structure. Instead, we find two HBs connecting water molecules with close proximity on either side of CaO layer (parallel to b-c plane) as shown in (b.1). Clearly, the interpretation of the IR spectrum could have immensely benefitted from the relaxed structure and BO calculations. In contrast, for α-C2SH (b.2), which contains both Si-OH and Ca-OH, the HB related to Si-OH is relatively stronger (BO = 0.066) compared to those linked to Ca-OH (BO = 0.014). The stronger HBs in α-C2SH (b.2) can be attributed to the fact that this crystal is formed under the high temperature hydrothermal conditions and is stable up to very high temperature. The other two crystals in group b, Dellaite (b.3) and Ca-Chondrodite (b.
[Question] What types of bonds are present in the group b crystals?
Choices:
1. The bond order analysis of Afwillite did not find evidence for the zundel cation (H2-O···H···OH2) structure. Instead, two hydrogen bonds were found connecting water molecules in close proximity on either side of the CaO layer, contradicting the proposed zundel cation interpretation of the IR spectrum.
2. The Si-O BOs in group b crystals are generally higher and show a broader distribution compared to the Ca-O BOs. The text states that the lower Si-O BO is associated with Si-OH bonds, while the higher BO is associated with Si-O bonds within the tetrahedral units. In contrast, the Ca-O BOs are significantly smaller and exhibit a narrow distribution over a wide range of bond lengths.
3. The group b crystals contain Si-O bonds, Ca-O bonds, covalent O-H bonds, and hydrogen bonds (HBs). Specifically, they contain Q silicates as well as covalent O-H bonds and HBs.

[Context] Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody concentration is the lowest of the five immunoglobulin subtypes (IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, IgE) found in human serum (50–300 ng/mL). However, its immunostimulatory potency is amplified by the high affinity receptor FcɛRI on mast cells and basophils, to which it binds. Crosslinking of the FcɛRI/IgE complex by a multivalent allergen triggers a signal transduction cascade, ultimately leading to an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, consisting of the release of preformed mediators which are present in cell granules such as histamine, serine proteases (tryptase and chymase), and the de novo synthesis and secretion of cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid metabolites (leukotrienes, prostaglandins) that attract and/or activate inflammatory cells.
[Question] What newly synthesized inflammatory mediators are produced during an IgE-mediated reaction?
Choices:
1. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) has the lowest concentration of the five immunoglobulin subtypes in human serum, typically 50-300 ng/mL. The other main subtypes are IgA, IgG, IgM, and IgD.
2. The cytokines, chemokines, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators released due to IgE-mediated mast cell/basophil activation serve to recruit and activate inflammatory cells like eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes at the site of the reaction.
3. IgE binds with high affinity to the FcɛRI receptor on mast cells and basophils. When IgE bound to FcɛRI is crosslinked by a multivalent allergen, it triggers mast cell and basophil degranulation and cytokine production, leading to an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. So the immunostimulatory potency of IgE is amplified by its binding to FcɛRI.
4. The newly synthesized inflammatory mediators produced due to IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil activation include cytokines, chemokines, and arachidonic acid metabolites like leukotrienes and prostaglandins. The synthesis and secretion of these mediators is triggered by the signaling cascade induced by FcɛRI crosslinking.

[Context] Even in the absence of engineered manipulation or social distortion, quality is not necessarily correlated with popularity. Consumers face a trade-off between performing cognitively expensive but accurate assessments based on quality and cognitively cheaper but less accurate choices based on popularity. Adler has shown that the cost of learning about quality will lead to “stars” with disproportionate popularity irrespective of differences in quality. Such trade-offs are common in social learning environments. Salganik et al. created a music-sharing platform to determine under which conditions one can predict popular musical tracks. The experiments showed that in the absence of popularity cues, a reliable proxy for quality could be determined by aggregate consumption patterns. However, popularity bias – for example when users were given cues about previous downloads of each track – prevented the quality ranking from being recovered. By influencing choices, popularity bias can reinforce initial fluctuations and crystallize a ranking that is not necessarily related to the inherent quality of the choices. This can happen even in the absence of explicit social signals, if the observed ranking is biased by popularity. Similar results have been found in other studies and have spurred a renewed interesting in the topic of predictability in cultural markets. Idealized multinomial logit models have been used to understand the behavior of social influence. Van Hentenryck et al. studied a model of trial-offer markets to analyze the effect of social influence on market predictability. In this model, users chose from a list of items ranked by quality rather than popularity. this modification makes the market predictable and aligns popularity and quality. Empirical tests of specific presentation policies combining quality and popularity do suggest that uncertainty can be reduced in this way. Finally, Becker et al. addressed the question of which network structure is most conducive to the wisdom of the crowd when people are influenced by others.

[Context] Thermal and ecological theory describe that organisms’ adaptation to temperature could be accomplished by different strategies resulting in different performances. Organisms may adapt by showing “horizontal shifts” in thermal optimum and thermal limits, and therefore warm-adapted organisms can achieve the same maximum performance of growth as cold-adapted ones. The “Hotter is better” hypothesis assumes that organisms’ performance will increase when warm adapted because temperature activates growth and other metabolic processes, and organisms adapted to lower temperatures are predicted to have lower maximum growth performances. Then, the “Hotter is better” hypothesis predicts that organisms will increase growth together with the increase in the thermal optimum. Organisms adapting to temperature can however move from “specialist” (i. e. growth is maximum at the optimum temperature) to “generalist” (maximum growth could be realized in a range of temperatures) and vice versa, with associated trade-offs in growth or other metabolic processes. If such trade-offs exist, and there is selection for an increased temperature range, specialist-generalist trade-offs would result in lower maximum performance for growth in warm-adapted organisms. Thermal adaptation could generate a higher and broader growth curve (i. e. reaction norm), increasing the temperature range. This adaptation is referred to as “hotter is broader and better” and will represent the win-win adaptation when organisms increased maximum growth and the breadth of reaction norm without trade-offs. For warm-adapted organism, as those from the tropical seas, it is unclear what type of thermal adaptations could experience when increasing warming will force thermal selection constraining performance.
[Question] What are two strategies organisms can use to adapt to temperature according to thermal and ecological theory?
Choices:
1. According to the text, organisms can adapt to temperature through ""horizontal shifts"" in thermal optimum and thermal limits. Organisms can also adapt by moving from ""specialist"" (maximum growth at optimum temperature) to ""generalist"" (maximum growth over a range of temperatures).
2. The text states that adapting from specialist to generalist strategies could result in trade-offs in maximum performance for growth or other metabolic processes in warm-adapted organisms. Specialist-generalist trade-offs could lead to lower maximum performance.
3. The text states it is unclear what type of thermal adaptations tropical organisms, which are already warm-adapted, will experience with further warming that could constrain their performance.

[Question] What structures do not provide clues about how the departure of eIF1 leads to the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from eIF2?
Choices:
1. The structures mentioned in the text do not provide clues about how the departure of eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1) triggers the release of the Pi group from eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2).
2. Hydroxyl radical probing experiments provided data suggesting an interaction between domain III of eIF2γ and h44 in rRNA.
3. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a protein complex that plays a key role in the initiation of mRNA translation. It binds GTP and methionyl initiator tRNA and recruits them to the 40S ribosomal subunit to form the 43S pre-initiation complex.
4. After the departure of eIF1, the inorganic phosphate (Pi) group is released from eIF2. This converts eIF2 from its GTP-bound form to its GDP-bound form (eIF2-GDP). The release of the Pi group and the conversion to the GDP-bound form allows eIF2 to dissociate from the ribosome.

[Context] CdSe QDs are chemically stable and highly luminescent in the entire visible light range. Moreover, electrons within dots occupy quantized energy levels and the size of the dots determines their degree of confinement and influences the occupied density of states affecting electrical and optical properties. Therefore, several CdSe-based QD solar cells have been fabricated during the recent years. Besides use in solar cells, other optical applications of such quantum dots are in lasers, light emitting diodes and quantum computation. Size dependence of semiconducting QDs with tunable band-gap affect their optical properties. A sharp size distribution and a long-range order of QDs is beneficial, because it leads to a more uniform emission spectrum. The photoluminescence can be further enhanced and the emission spectrum be broadened by combining these semiconductor QD with metals, such as Au or Ag, having plasmonic properties. Au growth on active semiconducting materials are important for their metallic contacts and or as charge recombination centers. Therefore, it is a suitable material for overgrowth and subsequent monitoring of correlation effects. However, information on order and correlation effects, which is desirable for many device applications, are only rarely available. Systematic monitoring of self-assembled growth behavior and corresponding morphological evolution of Au on QD array can help in engineering the design for optoelectronic devices with improved electrical properties.
[Question] What are some of the unique properties of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) that make them useful for applications like solar cells?
Choices:
1. The size of CdSe QDs determines the degree of quantum confinement for electrons within the dots, which affects the density of energy states that can be occupied. Smaller QDs have larger band gaps and can emit shorter wavelength light. Larger QDs have smaller band gaps and emit longer wavelengths. So the QD size tunes the optical band gap and emission spectrum.
2. Systematically monitoring how gold grows on ordered arrays of CdSe QDs can provide information about correlation effects and long-range order. A sharp QD size distribution and long-range QD order is beneficial for getting uniform optical properties. Understanding the gold growth can help engineer devices like QD solar cells or LEDs with improved electrical properties.
3. Metals like gold have plasmonic properties. When gold is grown on semiconducting CdSe QDs, the interaction between the gold and QDs can enhance the QDs' photoluminescence and broaden their emission spectrum. The gold can act as charge recombination centers.
4. CdSe QDs are chemically stable and highly luminescent across the entire visible light spectrum. The electrons within the dots occupy quantized energy levels, and the size of the dots determines the degree of electron confinement, which affects the dots' electrical and optical properties. Therefore, CdSe QDs can be tuned to have desired band gaps and optical properties.

[Context] A few consensus sequences have been proposed for Rossmann-fold NAD(P)-binding proteins. Rossmann et al. first found the phosphate-binding sequence G-X1–2-G-X-X-G from an alignment of the sequences of dogfish lactate dehydrogenase, pig, lobster and yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine glutamate dehydrogenase. However, this phosphate-binding motif is relatively short and exceptions to this motif have been found, so it would not be a reliable signature for Rossmann-fold NAD(P)-binding proteins. Subsequently, Kleiger and Eisenberg found G-X-X-X-[G/A] motifs following the phosphate-binding G-X1–2-G-X-X-G motif in flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and NAD(P)-binding Rossmann folds. They proposed an extended G-X1–2-G-X-X-G-X-X-X-[G/A] motif as an indicator of Rossmann folds that bind FAD or NAD(P). However, recent analyses showed that the fourth residue after the third conserved Gly in the G-X1–2-G-X-X-G motif is not a conserved Gly or Ala but is variable. Using geometric matching to cluster phosphate-binding sites of Rossmann-fold proteins with similar 3D structure, Brakoulias and Jackson found a variant of the G-X-G-X-X-G motif, namely, G-X-G-X-V-G and a new G-X-X-X-G-I-G motif. Because 1d motifs with similar structures depend on the cofactor type (NAD or NADP) and on the side chain orientations, 1d motifs derived without consideration of the cofactor type and/or local similarity of both backbone and side chain structures would not be reliable in annotating protein function from sequence alone.

[Question] Why did the researchers look for trypsin inhibitors in the MMD of N. cruentata?
Choices:
1. The text does not provide details on the methods used. However, based on the goal stated, the researchers likely extracted components from the MMD of N. cruentata spiders. They then tested the extracts for trypsin inhibitory activity, isolating the specific molecules responsible for this activity. Common methods for isolating enzyme inhibitors include chromatographic techniques like affinity chromatography.
2. Trypsin is a serine protease found in the digestive system that hydrolyzes proteins. It cleaves peptide bonds in which the carbonyl group is contributed by either an arginine or lysine residue.
3. The goal was to characterize peptidase inhibitors from the spider Nephilingis cruentata. Specifically, the researchers wanted to isolate and characterize molecules with trypsin inhibitory activity from the major ampullate ducts (MMD) of N. cruentata.
4. The MMD is one of the glands that produces the silk for N. cruentata's web. This silk needs to be stored in the spider's body without being degraded by the spider's own enzymes like trypsin. Therefore, researchers hypothesized that the MMD may contain trypsin inhibitors to protect the stored silk. Isolating these inhibitors could lead to characterization of novel peptidase inhibitors.

Previous studies have shown that HDI monomer, oligomers, and other isocyanates can have a variety of adverse effects on cultured cancer cell lines and animal models. However, human cancer cell lines likely provide less relevant information on toxic exposure effects than normal human cells because cancer cell lines have many mutations that may cause them to respond to insults differently than do normal human cells.

[Context] Group IV clathrates are ideal systems for exploring the possibility of incorporating inert guests. A natural way of obtaining intrinsic clathrate would be the direct synthesis of empty clathrate without inclusion of guest. This certainly represents a major experimental challenge because empty clathrate was predicted to be thermodynamically stable only under negative pressure. Another possibility is to use electrically inert guests that fit geometrically within cavities and weakly interact with the host atoms, for example, noble gas elements. Indeed, empty type II clathrate hydrate “Ice XVI”, a structural analog of group IV clathrate, has been obtained by pumping neon guests out of neon hydrate. To this end, theoretical studies have suggested that inert-gas-encapsulated group IV clathrate can maintain charge neutrality and thus preserves appealing opto-electronic properties of the framework. Quantum chemistry calculations beyond density functional theory also indicated that the formation of these clathrates is energetically favorable. However, despite the high promise and predicted high stability, experimental synthesis of these inert gas inorganic clathrate has not been reported.

[Context] Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein. In adults its expression is restricted, but at sites of inflammation it modulates several components of the immune response. The effects of TSP-1 include, but are not limited to, neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, phagocytosis of neutrophils, regulation of T cell function via receptor ligation, activation of latent TGF-β1 and the inhibition of angiogenesis. The phenotype of the TSP-1 KO mouse has been well described, presenting in a way that is similar to, albeit less severe than TGF-β1 and TGF-βR KO mice. Despite this chronic inflammatory phenotype characterised by systemic leukocytosis, raised levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and impaired wound healing and a Sjorgren's syndrome like ocular surface disease the TSP-1 KO mouse is resistant to some models of autoimmunity, such as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), while remaining susceptible to others, such as Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis (EAU). The phenotype of the T cell response in both these models is the same (S. R. Morwood and L. B. Nicholson. unpublished data), which makes it difficult to understand how the outcomes of the diseases are divergent. Local factors in the eye may be important to the differences in outcome because of the critical role of TSP-1 in the regulation of angiogenesis, since in chronic uveitis, TSP-1 KO animals develop significantly more retinal angiogenesis than WT controls and this is associated with alterations in the phenotype of the infiltrating macrophages. It is therefore important to understand the regulation of TSP-1 by recruited macrophages, which are the dominant cell population during the early stages of uveitis and remain present throughout the course of disease.
[Question] Why is it important to understand the regulation of TSP-1 by recruited macrophages in uveitis?
Choices:
1. The phenotype of the T cell response is the same in both EAE and EAU models (as per unpublished data by S.R. Morwood and L.B. Nicholson). This makes it difficult to understand why the outcomes of EAE and EAU are different in the TSP-1 KO mouse.
2. Despite the chronic inflammatory phenotype, the TSP-1 KO mouse is resistant to some models of autoimmunity, such as EAE, while remaining susceptible to others, like EAU.
3. In uveitis, macrophages are the dominant cell population during the early stages and remain present throughout. Therefore, it is important to understand the regulation of TSP-1 by these recruited macrophages.

[Context] In addition to the analysis, the pre-processing and the segmentation procedure are both non-trivial issues that have a significant impact on any subsequent image analyzes, such as the calculation of porosity, tortuosity, and the surface area of a specific phase. Due to the lack of a non-distorted reference image, the quality of the pre-processing is typically assessed by subjective visual inspection. However, image pre-processing has a profound impact on following segmentation performance. Schluter et al. presented that, with suitable image enhancement prior to segmentation, segmentation algorithms became more robust and were less prone to operator bias. He analyzed the segmentation accuracy of the images before and after pre-processing and pointed out that the distortion leads to poor segmentation. In addition, the absence of ground truth makes it difficult to assess the quality of the segmentation. Pietsch et al. proved that subjective judgment was not a reliable standard for the selection of binarization criteria in the segmentation procedure, leading to uncertainties in the results. Therefore, a numerical metric to assess the quality of images is needed to guide the pre-processing step (setting parameters, selecting filters) so that the next segmentation step can result in further highly reliable quantitative analysis.

Such a beam naturally evolves upon propagation, with the polarization structure of the beam changing from near to far field. By exploiting the natural evolution of the vector beam, we convert the fundamental beam into high harmonic radiation at its focus where its polarization is primarily linear. This evolution of the generated high harmonic beam results in circularly polarized XUV radiation in the far field. Comparing to the non-colinear beam-mixing schemes, the laser beam can be modulated pixel-by-pixel enabling a complete and more flexible control of its spatial properties. This opens a field of vectorizing the radiation in both strong infrared and XUV radiation.

We show that AKAP9 deficiency did not impair T cell priming, expansion or migration into tissues. Rather, it prevented re-activation and retention of T cells in inflamed tissue in two clinically relevant disease models, anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) nephritis and experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis. The impaired retention in AKAP9 mice correlated with protection from developing organ damage. In vitro, AKAP9 was required for optimal MT-dependent endosomal TCR recycling to the surface of activated T cells. The functional consequences of this was apparent only under suboptimal antigen-presentation conditions as is observed with B cells or tissue-resident APCs.

Our previous analysis has also shown the relative abundance of each Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides to be about 0.1. Therefore, as an initial screen, we investigated the impact of prebiotic supplementation through two such common microorganisms, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides thetaiotamicron. We investigated the underlying metabolic reaction network to understand the mechanism and observed that prebiotics resulted in increased secretion of microbial metabolites such as lactate, acetate, and pyruvate.

Interestingly, we observed organism and prebiotic specific differences in the profile of secreted metabolites as well as distinct dose dependent optimal flux modes for different prebiotics. Extending the analysis to 119 gut microorganisms having capability of utilizing at least one of the prebiotics, we observed that majority of these gut microorganisms respond favorably to prebiotic supplementation in terms of secretion of acetate, lactate or pyruvate. These bacteria can therefore facilitate increase of 7-DHC flux.
[Question] What organisms were used in the co-metabolism models in this study?
Choices:
1. Since these additional gut microorganisms secrete acetate, lactate or pyruvate upon prebiotic supplementation, they can facilitate an increase of 7-DHC flux in human cells by providing microbial metabolites that stimulate 7-DHC biosynthesis.
2. It is known from previous analysis that the relative abundance of each Faecalibacterium and Bacteroides is about 0.1 in the human gut microbiome.
3. The metabolites secreted by gut microorganisms upon prebiotic supplementation (lactate, acetate, pyruvate) are absorbed by human cells. This leads to increased biosynthesis of 7-DHC in human cells.

[Context] Although parts of the scientific and economic communities have long recognised that the climate may be better represented as a stochastic system, official assessments of climate damages still rely on models with deterministic GMT. Their deterministic models generate trajectories of the expectation of GMT. These assessments can therefore account for uncertainty in the expected response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations by varying model parameters, but by design they omit that part of our uncertainty that arises from the deviations of individual realistic trajectories from the trajectory of the expectation.
[Question] What limitation exists with the current official climate damage assessment models?
Choices:
1. By design, the current official climate damage assessment models omit uncertainty that arises from deviations of individual realistic temperature trajectories from the trajectory of the expectation. They cannot account for stochastic variability in global mean temperature.
2. Current official climate damage assessment models account for uncertainty by varying model parameters. This allows them to generate different trajectories for the expectation of global mean temperature.
3. Modeling climate as a stochastic system and generating multiple realistic global mean temperature trajectories could better account for uncertainty in climate damages.

[Context] Doping is a common approach to increase the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductors under solar light. For example, by doping metal ions into the semiconductor, impurity levels could be introduced into the forbidden band of the semiconductor. The recombination of electrons and holes can be restrained and relatively wider band gap photocatalysts can stay active in the visible-light region accordingly. Doping non-metal ions (N, S, C, F, etc.) is another way to enhance the visible light efficiency by forming a new valance band, which is higher than the original one. In this way, the band gap would be narrowed and more visible light energy could be used. Liu et al. reported TiO2 sheets doped with sulfur using TiS2 as a precursor, leading to significantly enhanced photocatalytic efficiency under visible light. Fan et al. also introduced sulfur (using thiourea as a precursor) into TiO2 nanoparticle systems and obtained good results for the degradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light. These results show that doping sulfur is an efficient method to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.

[Context] A typical strategy for realizing the STDP in a neuromorphic circuit is to deploy two leaky integrators for pre and postsynaptic state variables (s. pre and s. post) in conjunction with an analog or digital memory unit to store the evaluated synaptic weight. This general framework has been applied to various synaptic circuit designs thus far. a good review is given by Bamford et al. Table  summarizes several previous STDP circuits that are capable of real-time scale operation. Notably, the state variables are often realized by (i) leaky voltage integrators using a standalone capacitor or the gate capacitor of a transistor (switched-capacitor integrators), (ii) current-starved inverter, and (iii) operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-based integrator. Scaling down a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) in the integrator (particularly channel length below 100 nm) causes a significant rise in subthreshold leakage current, and thus a large decrease in the relaxation time of the integrator with a given capacitor. For temporal learning, the relaxation time is a priori preferred to be comparable to that of the biological counterpart in favor of energy-efficient learning, sacrificing unnecessarily fast response. In this regard, needs for higher capacitance to compensate for the subthreshold leakage—maintaining the biologically plausible relaxation time—perhaps limit further scaling down. A workaround is to adopt digital technologies as done by Vogelstein et al. a random access memory (RAM) was deployed to store discrete state variable values, and their updates were evaluated in a programmable manner using a microcontroller unit (MCU). Upon every spiking event, the MCU scans the entire RAM and updates the synaptic weights according to the STDP rule. As such, this digital implementation readily offers flexibility in designing the STDP model, hence can serve as a convenient platform in combination with hardware neurons. A possible disadvantage is, however, such that the weight values in the RAM are updated in serial order (time consuming), which hinders a large network with a number of connections (synapses) from real-time interaction with physical environments.
[Question] Why does scaling down MOSFET channel length cause problems for integrator-based STDP circuits?
Choices:
1. Two common ways that state variables for STDP are realized in neuromorphic circuits are: (i) leaky voltage integrators using a standalone capacitor or the gate capacitor of a transistor (switched-capacitor integrators), and (ii) current-starved inverter.
2. The text explains that scaling down the channel length of MOSFETs below 100 nm in an integrator causes a significant rise in subthreshold leakage current. This leads to a large decrease in the relaxation time of the integrator for a given capacitor. Since a biologically plausible relaxation time is preferred for temporal learning and energy efficiency, the increased leakage limits further scaling down of the MOSFET channel length.
3. Advantages are that it offers flexibility in designing the STDP model, and can serve as a convenient platform combined with hardware neurons. A potential disadvantage is that updating the weights serially in RAM is time-consuming, which may hinder real-time interaction for a large network.
4. The state variables in neuromorphic STDP circuits typically include separate variables s.pre and s.post to represent pre- and postsynaptic neuronal activity respectively. Their relative values are used to evaluate synaptic weight changes according to the STDP learning rule.

XPS results, which are shown in , prove that the as-synthesized material is MoS2 and other compounds such as Mo2S5, MoS3 or MoO3, whose Mo3d peaks have higher binding energies, can be excluded. The UV-vis spectrum of the as-synthesized MoS2 is presented in. The TEM image is displayed in and there are many dark lines in the image. It looks very similar with the images obtained by Altavilla et al. and Grossiord et al. Both of them regarded the dark lines as standing parts of MoS2 layers. The details of the dark line (see ) and an observation of natural MoS2 through TEM (see ) both support this conclusion. Given that there is no parallel dark lines observed in the TEM image, one preliminary conclusion is drawn that the as-synthesized MoS2 is of single layer structure. In addition, it can be found through TEM that the as-synthesized MoS2 is in the morphology of nanosheets (see ). To further confirm the layer number of the as-synthesized MoS2 nanosheets, the sample was analysed with Raman spectroscopy. In the Raman spectrum of MoS2, the relative shift between the two peaks of and will shrink as the number of MoS2 layers decreases. Although previous related works do not provide a uniform value of the relative peak shift for certain layered MoS2 and some work found that the substrate will slightly affect both the peak shift and the relative peak shift, the difference between few layer and multi layer can be distinguished. For the Raman spectrum of the as-synthesized MoS2 nanosheets, as depicted in , the relative shift between the two peaks is 19.9 ± 0.6 cm, which confirms that the as-synthesized MoS2 nanosheets are of ultrathin shape with only single or few layers. Moreover, it was found that the as-synthesized MoS2 nanosheets can be well dispersed in cyclohexane forming stable and black colored translucent solution (see ). Considering the fact that clean or unmodified MoS2 will sink in cyclohexane, it can be deduced that the MoS2 nanosheets have been surface-modified.

[Context] Copper is commonly used as a current collector in lithium metal batteries due to its high conductivity, but it binds weakly to Li.This weak binding increases the nucleation overpotential required for the electrodeposition of lithium, resulting in the formation of lithium deposits with small critical nuclei sizes.Small lithium deposits formed during nucleation on bare copper aggregate into high surface area lithium deposits, which leads to issues with rapid electrolyte consumption.Hence, much research activity has been geared towards reducing the surface area of lithium deposits.Most common approaches like electrolyte engineering do not directly address the intrinsic instabilities at the copper current collector surface, resulting in poor electrodeposition at practical cycling <http://conditions.As|conditions.As> a result, other approaches such as copper modification strategies are increasingly critical for improving lithium electrodeposition at the <http://substrate.To|substrate.To> understand and address the tendency of bare copper substrates to form lithium deposits with high surface area, low nucleation overpotential (lithiophilic) substrates are being explored for promoting the deposition of low surface area lithium.Gold (Au) seeds and numerous graphene derivatives have been used as lithiophilic layers that promote the formation of low surface area lithium deposits by forming lithium alloys prior to lithium nucleation.Our previous work showed that the use of lithiophilic, atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown thin films of TiO2 coated on copper resulted in the formation of low surface area lithium clusters via a scalable route.Yet, while the strategy of modifying the surface of copper with lithiophilic materials yields better performing lithium metal batteries, lithiophilic substrates provide only limited improvements in terms of lithium surface area <http://reduction.As|reduction.As> a result, to push the performance of lithium metal batteries towards commercial relevance, it is critical to identify new substrate properties that can substantially reduce the surface area of lithium formed during electrodeposition.

[Context] PES intensity maps of HOMO level () illustrate the dependence of PES on photon energy. In pristine PAHs, PES does not depend on photon energy. in epoxy ornamented PAHs, structure related patterns surrounding each K point strengthen as the photon energy increases. This enhancement of the pattern by increase in photon energy is evidence of the final state effect, which can be related to the wavelength of the emitted electron. For example, electrons with kinetic energy of 160 eV have wavelength λ  = 0.97 Å, which is smaller than the C-C bond length (1.42 Å). In this case, the structure factor (defined in the methods section) dominates the atomic factor. In contrast, for photon energy of 20 eV, the final state electron has λ  = 2.74 Å, which is much longer than the C-C bond length. In this regime, PES intensity is less influenced by the structure factor than in the regime with higher photon energy.
[Question] What does PES intensity mapping of the HOMO level show for pristine PAHs versus epoxy ornamented PAHs?
Choices:
1. In pristine PAHs, the PES intensity map of the HOMO level does not depend on the photon energy used in the PES experiment. However, in epoxy ornamented PAHs, structure related patterns surrounding each K point in the PES map strengthen as the photon energy used for PES increases.
2. This enhancement is evidence of the final state effect in PES. The final state effect relates to the wavelength of the emitted photoelectron, which depends on its kinetic energy. For example, at a photon energy of 160 eV, the photoelectron has a wavelength of 0.97 Å, which is smaller than the C-C bond length of 1.42 Å. In this case, the structure factor dominates over the atomic factor in determining the PES intensity.

2. When a skyrmion and antiskyrmion annihilate each other, they emit a propagating spin wave upon the annihilation event.
3. It is possible to split a bi-skyrmion and bi-antiskyrmion by applying a driving current because the direction of skyrmion motion depends on its helicity.

[Context] Here we demonstrate that ebselen and its analogue ebsulphur bind to SOD1 at the Cys111 site in vitro. This interaction shifts the SOD1 monomer–dimer equilibrium in favour of the dimer and returns the affinity of the A4V dimer formation to that of the wild-type. This occurs without covalent tethering of monomer subunits within the SOD1 dimer. Importantly the increased dimer stability does not prevent heterodimer formation with hCCS. This proof of principle is important as Cys111-targeted drug compounds could bind the free sulphydryl of both mutant or wild-type SOD1 and should not prevent structurally important hCCS-catalyzed activation. Furthermore, we show by in-cell and in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) that ebselen reacts with disulphide-reduced SOD1 in the human cell cytosol causing the formation of the intra-subunit disulphide bond. In doing so, it promotes correct SOD1 folding and zinc binding. Directing the nascent protein down the correct PTM pathway prevents accumulation of unfolded species, thought to be the precursor of mutant SOD1 toxicity, premature degradation and aggregation. Thus, ebselen rescues the toxic characteristics of mutant SOD1 through two independent disulphide formation and dimer stabilization mechanisms, deployment of which is dependent on the nature of the environment. While non-native disulphide bonding is often used as a strategy to stabilize recombinant proteins, here we describe a possible therapeutic application of stimulated disulphide bonding within human cells. an exciting possibility given the rarity of cytosolic disulphides and the specificity that could hardwire into the system. Ebselen’s on-target SOD1 pharmacological chaperone activity, in combination with its usage history and positive secondary pharmacology reminiscent of edaravone, indicates that it is a very promising lead not only in the search for therapeutics, which can modulate pathogenic SOD1 behaviour in ALS, but also asthma.
[Question] Did ebselen and ebsulphur covalently link SOD1 monomer subunits within the dimer?

[Context] An ideal ion conducting polymer electrolyte for ambient temperature energy storage has been the dream pursued by many researchers. An enhanced safety may be achieved by complete replacement of organic carbonate-based liquid electrolytes, thus leading to facile and leak-free fabrication, flexibility, compactness, reduced weight and laminated structures. Scientific community has been focusing on polymer systems containing –EO– moieties for an all-solid cell construction and other polymers (e. g., PMMA, PVdF) in mostly hybrid/gel configurations. It is well known that polyethylene oxide (PEO) crystallizes at about 55 °C and ionic as well as segmental mobility are limited to its molten (amorphous) state at elevated temperatures. This impedes its widespread application into the global market. However, at elevated temperatures such polymers lose their dimensional stability being in molten state, which leads to non-homogeneity inside the cell. This facilitates the diffusion of Li ions through localized favourable paths, increasing both concentration gradients and defects that may create temperature deflections and short-circuits. Attempts have been also made to reduce the crystallinity to retain the amorphicity by incorporating various ceramics/metal oxides (e. g., Al2O3, CeO2, ZrO2, TiO2), but the target remains unachieved so far. Another problem is the solvent-based preparation procedure, where complete and “concrete” solvent removal is a herculean task. indeed, in most cases the unavoidable traces of solvent persisting in the polymer matrix create various interfacial stability issues, even enabling thermal runaway reactions.

[Context] Chemogenetic techniques, such as DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs), offer a means to repeatedly and non-invasively inactivate multiple brain sites simultaneously. When a modified human M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (hM4Di) is expressed in a target neuronal population, activity of such neurons is temporarily suppressed after systemic delivery of a biologically inert inducer compound, for instance, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). To achieve the intended chemogenetic silencing, the inhibitory DREADD, hM4Di, needs to be accurately localized to a target structure and expressed at a sufficiently high level to silence host neurons. In addition, the inducer compound must be available at a concentration high enough to bind and activate the DREADD. Previously, it was only possible to determine the extent of receptor expression through post-mortem histological analysis, and to determine ligand-binding characteristics ex vivo.
[Question] What technology allows for the temporary inactivation of multiple brain sites simultaneously in a non-invasive manner?
Choices:
1. For intended chemogenetic silencing via DREADDs, two requirements are: 1) The inhibitory DREADD must be accurately localized to and expressed at a sufficiently high level in the target neuronal structure in order to silence those neurons. 2) The designer drug inducer compound must be available systemically at a high enough concentration to bind to and activate the expressed DREADDs.
2. The inhibitory DREADD hM4Di is a modified human M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. When it is expressed in a target neuronal population and its designer drug ligand (such as clozapine-N-oxide or CNO) is systemically administered, the DREADD is activated which temporarily suppresses the activity of the neurons expressing it.

[Context] Most of the screenings of microorganism with PBAT degradation capacities have hitherto focused on bacteria, thereby the potential of fungal hydrolases has not yet been fully exploited. Yet fungi would deserve receiving attention. especially extremophilic and extremotolerant species, as they offer a source of proteins and compounds with functionality and stability under uttermost values of various physico-chemical parameters, in lieu of mesophilic ones. Some of the most stress-tolerant fungal isolates known to date are found in the group of black fungi, a heterogeneous assembly of melanotic microfungi, whose geographical distribution includes extreme and unusual habitats. In recent decades, the mechanisms of survival displayed by these organisms and their not yet fully elucidated eco-physiology have raised increasing interest, thereby the black fungi group includes nowadays a number of emerging model organisms. Recently, the bioremediation potential of some species was recognized, along with the ability of species isolated from oligotrophic environments to resort to recalcitrant carbon sources spurned by other microorganisms. Such a nutritional physiology, as demonstrated in the rock-associated Knufia chersonesos, can translate into the aptitude to tolerate and grow on monoaromatic compounds and to possibly feed on other types of alternative carbon sources. The screening of this and other black fungi species might therefore hold great potential also in view of the biodegradation of synthetic polyesters.
[Question] Why does the ability of K. chersonesos to grow on recalcitrant carbon sources suggest potential for PBAT degradation?
Choices:
1. Interest has increased because the mechanisms of survival and not yet fully understood eco-physiology displayed by these organisms have raised curiosity and made them emerging model organisms to study.
2. It was discovered that some species isolated from oligotrophic environments have the ability to use recalcitrant carbon sources that are not used by other microorganisms. This ability could translate to bioremediation potential.
3. The black fungus Knufia chersonesos was found to be able to use recalcitrant carbon sources not utilized by other microbes. This nutritional ability indicates it may be able to degrade synthetic polyesters.
4. PBAT is a synthetic polyester, so its chemical structure is recalcitrant and difficult to break down. The capacity of K. chersonesos to use unusual carbon sources indicates it may have enzymes to degrade challenging compounds like PBAT.

[Context] This could indeed be a promising system, e. g., for drug delivery, as it can provide a nanocontainer with a significant void together with temperature-controlled permeability of the inner PNIPAm shell and a high colloidal stability due to the outer, swollen PNIPMAm shell. The presence of the void can provide storage of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic guest molecules whose penetration into the void is not necessarily driven by long range Coulomb attraction like in the case of binding of charged molecules to oppositely charged carrier. The uptake of the molecules can be achieved via diffusion through the shells of the HSS nanogel immersed in solution of the guest molecules with their subsequent arrest via locking the permeability of the inner shell.

[Context] In this study, we use Laptev Sea sediments (Arctic Ocean) to investigate the putative instability of PF-C in the Lena River catchment (central Siberia) during the last glacial–interglacial period. Initially, we focus on the Younger Dryas-Preboreal transition (YD-PB, ca.11,650 yBP) during which the Northern Hemisphere experienced an abrupt temperature increase. The YD cooling event was a sudden return to near-glacial conditions during last deglaciation, likely to be triggered by atmosphere–ocean feedback associated with meltwater fluxes and rapid sea ice expansion combined with a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Ice cores from Greenland have documented the re-establishment of the post-glacial warming in the δO record as a sudden temperature increase. Given the abrupt nature of the YD termination, the YD-PB climate transition represents an ideal benchmark to assess the stability of PF-C during rapid climate warming. Finally, based on a collection of published studies, we investigate the PF-C remobilization over a longer deglacial warming period. This study thus presents observation-based evidence of massive PF-C destabilization during past warming events and contributes a new angle to the ongoing debate on mechanisms driving the increase of atmospheric CO2 during the last deglaciation. Our results suggest that thermal reactivation of dormant permafrost might have been an important source of carbon.

[Context] The structure of chromatin, beyond the 10-nm fiber, remains an intense topic of research and debate.The traditional textbook view suggests that 10-nm chromatin folds into a regular and rigid 30-nm zigzag fiber, where nucleosomes interact preferentially with their second-nearest neighbors (i.e., nucleosome i with i ± 2).While this zigzag fiber model is supported by in vitro studies of reconstituted chromatin arrays, experiments interrogating chromatin inside cells have consistently failed to detect 30-nm fibers.Instead, accumulating evidence is shifting the structural paradigm of chromatin in vivo in favor of the “liquid-like” or “fluid-like” model, which proposes that 10-nm fibers condense into an irregular and dynamic polymorphic ensemble.The term “liquid” here is used to emphasize a structure that is absent of long-range translational order, where nucleosomes can flow and relax easily, and engage in interactions with a wide range of neighbors, like in a “sea of nucleosomes”.Nucleosomes within disordered chromatin are proposed to form heterogeneous groups of variable sizes and densities—interspersed with nucleosome-free regions.Furthermore, the density of nucleosomes, rather than the structure of the 30-nm fiber, is what seems to distinguish different chromatin regions (e.g., nucleosome density is higher in heterochromatin than in euchromatin), and change upon differentiation.Sequencing-based methods that can resolve chromatin interactions in situ at single-nucleosome resolution—i.e., micrococcal nuclease chromosome conformation assay (Micro-C), ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq), and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture with nucleosome orientation (Hi-CO)—suggest that the irregular organization of chromatin is underpinned by dominant interactions among i and i ± 2 nucleosomes.Consistent models where chromatin exhibits a large-scale disordered organization but contains strong short-range zigzag contacts include the hierarchical looping model and the multiplex higher-order folding model.
[Question] How is the term ""liquid"" used to describe chromatin structure?
Choices:
1. The liquid-like model proposes that the density of nucleosomes, rather than the structure of a 30-nm fiber, distinguishes different chromatin regions. For example, heterochromatin has a higher nucleosome density than euchromatin.
2. The liquid-like model proposes that nucleosomes form heterogeneous groups of variable sizes and densities, interspersed with nucleosome-free regions.
3. ""Liquid"" is used to emphasize a chromatin structure that lacks long-range translational order, where nucleosomes can flow and relax easily, and engage in interactions with a wide range of neighbors, like a ""sea of nucleosomes"".

[Context] The assumption of a rapidly relaxing thermal bath is not applicable to viscoelastic fluids like semi-dilute polymer solutions, micellar systems, or dense colloidal suspensions. Such systems are characterised by stress relaxation times τs comparable or even larger than that of the colloidal motion. Accordingly, when colloidal particles are driven through such a fluid (e. g., by means of an optical trap), it can not be regarded to remain in equilibrium. Theoretical studies predicted that in this regime the particle dynamics becomes largely affected by the fluid’s non-equilibrium microstructural deformations, and that the measured viscosity may exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the trap stiffness. In particular for large driving velocities (high shear rates), several experiments reported the occurrence of unsteady particle motion and strong deviations from the behaviour in simple viscous liquids. These findings originate from the nonlinear rheological properties in viscoelastic fluids (e. g., shear thinning), which is generally observed in micro- and macro-rheological experiments.

The objectives of the current study were to (a) develop an automated method for 3D measurement of tumour using ellipsoid-fit model, (b) compare the TV and TMD measured with the ellipsoid-fit model against the current standard i. e. the manual-assessment with axial planes by the radiologist and (c) investigate the effect of 3D measurement of tumour in PI-RADS v2.1 assessment.
[Question] What is the current standard method for tumor measurement according to the text?
Choices:
1. PI-RADS v2.1 assessment is a system for assessing prostate MRI scans. It uses a 2D approach for tumor measurement which may be influenced by 3D measurement of tumor diameter and volume. PI-RADS v2.1 also has different decision rules for each score.
2. The current standard is manual assessment with axial planes by a radiologist.
3. A 2D approach may not account for the tumor's full 3D shape and volume. It relies on individual slice measurements which could underestimate tumor size.
4. The text states tumor size and volume estimation should be considered carefully because it may have implications for prostate cancer risk stratification. Inaccurate estimation could lead to improper risk classification.

[Context] In this work, we investigate the skipping of deformable elastic solid spheres on water. We observe that elastic spheres can skip for impact angles nearly three times larger than predicted for rigid spheres. Experiments and numerical modelling show that the spheres deform throughout impact in response to elastic waves propagating in the material. In some cases these elastic waves actually interact with the air–water interface to create nested cavities. We determine how the deformed geometry scales with material properties and initial impact kinematics. Using an analytical model to relate deformation to the hydrodynamic lift force, we identify the mechanisms by which elastic spheres skip so readily on water. Furthermore, we compute the normal and tangential restitution coefficients and find, surprisingly, that they display analogous behaviour to liquid droplets bouncing on inclined liquid films. Based on our findings about single impact events, we explain how elastic spheres are able to achieve multiple successive skips on water.

[Context] The discovery of DNA as a genetic material and its double helical structure led to numerous studies directed at understanding DNA-small molecule interactions. Typically, DNA-small molecule interaction has two prominent modes viz., intercalation and minor groove binding. The research efforts of Dervan and Lown have set forth the foundation for developing a series of small molecules with affinity for the AT-rich minor groove of B-DNA.4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and bisbenzimides (Hoechst dyes) are some of the well-studied nuclear staining agents that bind with the minor groove. Unfortunately, these blue-emitting DNA binders require ultraviolet (UV) light for excitation which is known to cause cellular DNA damage through free radical generation, eventually causing cell death. Moreover, Hoechst dyes, despite being faithful to the AT-rich minor groove of DNA, are nonetheless prone to fasten onto GC-rich sites, too and also show binding affinity towards single-stranded (ss) DNA and RNA. Similarly, DAPI suffers from the disadvantages of non-specific binding to RNA and requirement of high concentration for effective imaging, thereby limiting its use only to fixed cells. Apart from minor groove binders, ethidium bromide (EtBr) and propidium iodide (PI) have been used for cell staining and gel-imaging studies. However, impermeable nature of these dyes limited their application to fixed and dead cells only. Recently, cyan and green fluorescence DNA-selective probes such as BENA435 and C61 have been reported. However, these probes, upon binding to DNA, exhibit fluorescence enhancement with low quantum yields. Thomas et al. recently reported a dinuclear ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complex as a DNA-staining probe, which nonetheless required high concentration for cellular imaging.

[Context] These efforts have led to the discovery of new structures at the chromatin level or improved our understanding of genomic organization at an even higher resolution than before. Initially, individual chromosomes were shown to occupy distinct territories within interphase nuclei using fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. However, in recent years, the development of chromatin conformation capture (3C) based proximity mapping techniques has revealed that the genome is indeed separated into compartments, and furthermore into self-interacting genomic regulatory units termed topologically associating domains (TADs). Further improvements to 3C based methods have allowed for the detection of typical enhancer-promoter loops. Most of these higher resolution approaches are based on averages derived from cell populations in asynchronous cultures. Development of super-resolution microscopy techniques and advances in new probe technologies, particularly the Oligopaint approach combined with automated sequential hybridization, have led to a better understanding of these proposed chromatin structures at a single cell level with improved resolution.
[Question] What are topologically associating domains (TADs) and how were they discovered?
Choices:
1. The text states that 3C-based proximity mapping techniques have revealed that the genome is separated into compartments and further into topologically associating domains (TADs). So these techniques provided evidence for higher-order folding and organization of chromatin within the nucleus.
2. The text mentions that fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was initially used to show that individual chromosomes occupy distinct territories within interphase nuclei. More recently, chromatin conformation capture (3C) based proximity mapping techniques have been used to reveal compartments and topologically associating domains (TADs) in the genome.
3. The text defines topologically associating domains (TADs) as self-interacting genomic regulatory units. TADs were revealed by 3C-based proximity mapping techniques, so they were discovered using chromatin conformation capture methods.

[Context] In this context, the development of rapid, cost-effective, and automated methods for the identification and, eventually, quantification of bacteria such as S. Typhimurium is urgent. These methods, - integrated with preventive strategies such as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) - could significantly improve the safety of the food chain, from raw to processed foods. Such an issue has been addressed by adopting a number of strategies, but the goal is far from being accomplished since the current regulation for food analysis requires that alternative methods, should have sensitivity and specificity of at least 99%, be rapid and not requiring specialized personnel to carry out the analysis. These techniques can be grouped as immunology-based assays (ELISA), nucleic acid-based (PCR) assays, and biosensors. The first two groups have specificity and sensitivity almost comparable to the conventional methods, but cannot be considered easy-to-use techniques. Moreover, they share with other tests for Salmonella spp. some drawbacks such as the need for a long pre-enrichment step to recover stressed cells, possible cross-reactions with related antigens, sensitivity and antigen modification depending on the sample matrix, and high cost for automation and industrial application. Furthermore, the result provided by these methods is easily influenced by intrinsic characteristics of the food such as background microbiota, sample matrix and inhibitory substances (heavy metals, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, antibiotics and organic compounds). In addition, though PCR is very sensitive, thereby allowing shorter enrichment times, it is prone to detect also dead bacteria.
[Question] What factors in food can influence the results of current Salmonella detection techniques?
Choices:
1. ELISA and PCR require specialized training and equipment to carry out properly. They involve multiple sample preparation and assay steps that need careful standardization and control. The procedures and interpretation of results is complex compared to simpler assays like biosensors. This makes them more difficult to implement for routine food testing by non-specialized personnel.
2. Some current techniques are immunology-based assays like ELISA, nucleic acid-based assays like PCR, and biosensors. Drawbacks include the need for long pre-enrichment steps, possible cross-reactions with related antigens, sensitivity to the sample matrix, high costs for automation and industrial use, and interference by background microbiota, sample matrix, and inhibitory substances in food. PCR also detects dead bacteria.
3. The goals include developing methods that are rapid, cost-effective, automated, and can be integrated with preventive strategies like HACCP to improve food safety throughout the supply chain. The new methods should have sensitivity and specificity of at least 99%, be easy to use without specialized personnel, and provide results rapidly.

[Context] To reveal the relationship between atomic structure and function in ribosome biogenesis, we determined a 2.1-Å crystal structure of yeast Nop9 and probed its activity in vitro and in vivo. Distinct from the two other PUF protein subfamilies, Nop9 adopts a C-shaped fold containing 11 PUM repeats. Consistent with a role in processing 20S pre-rRNA to mature 18S rRNA, we find that Nop9 binds to the fragment of internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) present in the 20S pre-rRNA. Different from the classical PUFs and Puf-A subfamilies, Nop9 binds specifically to ITS1 RNA fragments that encompass both single-stranded and duplex regions. A small-angle X-ray-scattering (SAXS) model of the Nop9. ITS1 RNA complex and biochemical probing confirm that Nop9 recognizes the base of the ITS1 RNA stem loop. Since the Nop9-binding site overlaps the binding site of Nob1, which processes 20S pre-rRNA to 18S rRNA in the cytoplasm, we examined whether Nop9 may play a role in stabilizing the 20S pre-rRNA in the nucleolus. We demonstrate that the levels of the 20S pre-rRNA are reduced upon depletion of Nop9 and restored to normal levels upon depletion of both Nop9 and Nob1 in vivo. Moreover, the presence of Nop9 reduces the cleavage efficiency of Nob1 in vitro. Together, our results suggest that Nop9’s essential role in SSU ribosome biogenesis is to prevent premature cleavage of the 20S pre-rRNA by Nob1 in the nucleolus.

[Context] The two proposed mechanisms for external solar forcing of Neptune are essentially heliospheric (through GCR) or photospheric (through solar ultraviolet) in origin. The analysis to investigate them here uses two approaches.

From detailed measurements and comparison of the internal gain in hybrid plasmonic waveguides and their photonic counterparts we found that the transparency threshold, at which the internal gain starts, is 35 times lower in the plasmonic waveguide. Our investigations support our hypothesis that this significant difference and the observed ultra-high optical gain in the hybrid plasmonic waveguides at low pump intensity can be attributed mostly to ‘hot’ electrons that are generated in the metallic film and are able to cross over the metal-oxide-semiconductor interface to alter the carrier density in the plasmonic waveguide.

[Context] In order to precipitate CaCO3 in a place separated from seawater by multiple layers of tissue, corals ultimately must be able to import Ca ions and DIC from seawater and transport them to the site of calcification. These processes remain poorly understood and controversial. Although proposed routes of ion and molecule import differ in their details, potential import processes can be broadly grouped into three categories.(1) passive CO2 diffusion, (2) active bicarbonate and other ion transport and (3) whole seawater import though the time scale of each of these processes will differ. Which of these three processes dominates the import pathway for DIC species remains unknown in part because a complete characterization of the internal carbonate chemistry of corals is lacking. In addition to the import of necessary ions, corals must raise the aragonite saturation state of the calcifying fluid to obtain rapid rates of calcification. It is widely believed that this is achieved through a H efflux pump that creates high pH and, via chemical equilibrium and kinetic limitations, high [CO3] in the calcifying space. The H efflux pump is proposed to be coupled to Ca influx via a Ca–H ATPase. This theoretical model for coral calcification is considered the foundation for hypotheses explaining the response of calcification to future acidification, yet direct measurements of at least two of the several carbonate system parameters to fully substantiate this conceptual model for coral calcification are lacking. Based on either indirect geochemical tracer evidence or sensor-based pH data combined with the assumption of either active HCO3 transport or whole seawater import, several studies have also suggested that corals concentrate DIC to roughly twice the seawater value at the site of calcification. Others, however, have assumed that coral internal [DIC] is similar to or lower than that in seawater. Furthermore, while a linkage between H-pumping and carbon species transportation has recently been suggested, confirmation by direct measurements is required.
[Question] What confirmation is required for the suggested linkage between hydrogen ion pumping and carbon species transportation?
Choices:
1. Indirect geochemical tracer evidence or sensor-based pH data combined with the assumption of either active bicarbonate transport or whole seawater import suggest that corals concentrate DIC to about twice the seawater value at the site of calcification.
2. Direct measurements of at least two carbonate system parameters are lacking to fully substantiate the conceptual model for coral calcification.
3. Direct measurements are required to confirm the suggested linkage between hydrogen ion pumping and carbon species transportation.

Moreover, periodic arrays of chemically encoded single droplets containing sequestered dye molecules, proteins, enzymes, nanoparticles or microparticles can be readily produced in situ during droplet assembly or partitioned into the patterned arrays post-assembly. By adjusting the ratio of PDDA and ATP to limit local molecular diffusion we demonstrate that acoustically patterned populations of coacervate droplets containing different chemical information can be spatially positioned within the sample chamber of the trapping device.

These studies have shown that DNA methylation can be successfully targeted, dependent on the combination of effector domains and localised chromatin confirmation, and that this has a direct effect on cell biology.
[Question] What recent advances have enabled researchers to identify the role of DNA methylation in early tumorigenesis?
Choices:
1. Recent advances in epigenome editing, such as coupling the catalytic domain of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A to zinc finger proteins, TALEs, and the dCas9-CRISPR system, have enabled researchers to target and introduce DNA methylation to specific loci.

[Context] Of these enzymes, chitosan hydrolases can be divided into chitinases, chitosanases and, possibly, chitinosanase. Depending on their subsite specificities, the resulting oligomeric products will have defined GlcN or GlcNAc units at their reducing and/or non-reducing ends. All chitinases are able to cleave the glycosidic linkage between two acetylated GlcNAc units but not the linkage between two GlcN units, while all chitosanases are able to cleave between two non-acetylated GlcN units but not between two GlcNAc units, with possible exceptions. Although chitinases have been extensively studied much less is known on the more diverse chitosanases, which are produced by a variety of bacteria and fungi and by viruses. In the past, chitosanases have long been classified into four classes based on their GlcN/GlcNAc specificities. While all chitosanases hydrolyze the linkage between two GlcN units, class I chitosanases also cleave the GlcNAc-GlcN bond (cleavage site X│D, with X = GlcN or GlcNAc. D = GlcN), and class III enzymes also cleave the GlcN-GlcNAc bond (D│X). Class II chitosanases are thought to only cleave the GlcN-GlcN bond (D│D), while class IV enzymes cleave all linkages except for the GlcNAc-GlcNAc bond. However, a recent study revealed that chitosanase specificities are much more diverse than this classification suggests. In particular, chitosanases also differ in their specificities or preferences for GlcN or GlcNAc subunits at subsites (−2) and (+2). Apart from the above classification groups based on cleavage site, chitosanases have also been grouped based on sequence similarity, resulting in six glycoside hydrolase (GH) families, namely GH5, GH7, GH8, GH46, GH75, and GH80. chitosanases of GH46 have been studied most extensively. So far, no direct relationship has been established between the above-mentioned chitosanase classes I-IV and the GH families. This broad sequence diversity in the chitosanase family, which greatly exceeds that of chitinases, raises the prospect of studying their subsite specificities in the hope of finding more specific enzymes that might be useful for producing chitosan oligomers with more defined PA.
[Question] How else have chitosanases been classified apart from their catalytic activity?

They do not harm the nearby objects or contribute to the x-ray image, which is, again, detected on an imaging plate with sensitivity to all ionizing radiation. As an additional measure, a magnetic x-ray cleaner in front of the x-ray detector can prevent residual electrons and ions from contributing to the image. The source can maintain a small size despite the higher laser energy, due to the confinement of fast electron transport, and therefore x-ray generation, to the small volume of the needle target. Two effects can further reduce this volume. the curved target surface can lead to a converging plasma movement in the laser interaction, and the plasma expansion into vacuum can reduce the high-density region effectively by losing part of the plasma to lower density regions.

Such a fabrication protocol, to the best of our knowledge, has been successfully achieved only by Liu et al. for gas sensing using a gold/palladium nanoarchitecture. Here, lithographically fabricated gold nanomarkers were used to position a gold nanodisk on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-covered glass substrate in a lattice configuration. Using the same nanomarkers, a single VO2 nanodisk was subsequently positioned adjacent to its neighbouring gold nanodisk. The sample was then annealed to render the VO2 nanostructure crystalline (insulating-M1) and phase transforming. As shown in the scanning electron micrograph (SEM, ), the differential contrast of the two nanostructures clearly shows the efficacy of the design. To demonstrate that the nanomodulator operates solely by near-field electromagnetic interactions, we fabricated ten similar patterns on that same substrate with varying separations between the gold and VO2 nanodisks ().

[Context] However, the virus may impact the microenvironment around infected cells and thus have the potential to influence the tumor without directly infecting malignant cells. Also, the ability to control the virus and EBV reactivation may serve indirectly as a surrogate of general host immune competence. An example of such interplay is the inflammatory effects of EBV on gastric cancers through pro-inflammatory molecule expression such as cytokines responsible for increase in growth in EBV infected cells (IL5,IL6). Hence, EBV infection and its control has the potential to give insight into both tumor biology and host immunity.
[Question] How does the example of EBV infection promoting gastric cancer growth demonstrate the interplay between viral infection, tumor biology, and host immunity?
Choices:
1. In gastric cancer, EBV infects cells and causes them to express pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytokines create inflammation that promotes cancer cell growth. This example shows how viral infection (EBV) impacts tumor biology (growth promotion) through effects on host immunity (cytokine expression and inflammation).
2. EBV may impact the microenvironment around infected cells. This altered microenvironment could then influence the tumor's growth.
3. First, the ability to control EBV infection and reactivation serves as an indicator of the host's overall immune competence. Second, controlling EBV requires an immune response, so studying this response provides insight into host immunity.

In contrast with the synchronization of conventional STNOs based on giant magnetoresistive structures, the synchronization of SHNOs occurs only above a certain threshold external microwave signal power.

[Context] Despite the advantages mentioned, Eu complexes are strongly limited by their air stability according to the standard potential φ(Eu/Eu) = −0.38 V. To the best of our knowledge, there was only one report of OLED device based on Eu complexes, with unsatisfied performance in external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.01% and maximum luminance of 10 cd m considering the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the complex to be 85%. Thus, more efforts must be worked on the rational design of Eu complexes and the deep understanding of the electroluminescent process to boost efficiency and luminance. We propose that the steric effect of cryptate ligands and coordinate interaction could improve the stability of Eu complexes. The steric effect prevents Eu from O2 by a more rigid structure. Improving the coordination interaction between the ligand and Eu can largely enhance the thermodynamic stability. Thus, two ligands, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (N4) and 1,4,7,10,13,16,21,24-octaazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane (N8) are chosen for the design of four Eu-containing azacryptates named as EuX2–Nn (X = Br, I, n = 4, 8). Series of crystal analysis, spectral, stability, and theoretical studies were undertaken to reveal the photophysical nature of these Eu complexes. Then EuX2–N8 complexes were chosen as emitters in OLEDs for their high efficiency and good thermal/air stability. As a breakthrough, the optimized device using EuI2–N8 exhibits excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 17.7% and a maximum luminance of 25470 cd m.

[Context] Type-II Weyl fermions have been first predicted in the orthorhombic (Td) phase of WTe2 with space group Pmn21 (ref.). However, it is challenging to observe the extremely small Fermi arcs in WTe2 because of the small separation of the Weyl points (0.7% of the Brillouin zone). Weyl fermions have also been predicted in the low-temperature phase of MoTe2 with much larger Fermi arcs, and signatures of the Fermi arcs have been suggested in a combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy study and other ARPES studies. The existence of Weyl fermions has been relied on the assumption that the low-temperature phase of MoTe2 is isostructural to the noncentrosymmetric Td phase of WTe2 (refs , ). The high-temperature monoclinic 1T′ phase with an inclined staking angle of ∼93.9° has a centrosymmetric P21/m space group. Although a temperature-induced structural transition with a change in the stacking angle from ∼93.9° to 90° has been reported both crystallographically and computationally, there are two possible space groups can be assigned to the low-temperature orthorhombic phase—noncentrosymmetric Pmn21 and centrosymmetric Pnmm. Previous X-ray diffraction study was limited to resolve the subtle differences between these two space groups to provide conclusive evidence on the inversion symmetry. Recent ARPES studies have detected Fermi arcs at the low-temperature phase. however, the absence of Fermi arcs at high-temperature 1T′ phase is difficult to be observed because of the thermal broadening. Since the noncentrosymmetry is a prerequisite for realizing Weyl fermions for non-magnetic materials, it is critical to reveal the inversion symmetry breaking from Raman spectroscopic measurements, which are directly sensitive to the crystal symmetry.
[Question] What assumption has the existence of Weyl fermions in MoTe2 relied on?
Choices:
1. The existence of Weyl fermions in MoTe2 has relied on the assumption that the low-temperature phase of MoTe2 is isostructural to the noncentrosymmetric Td phase of WTe2.
2. It is challenging to observe the extremely small Fermi arcs in WTe2 because of the small separation between the Weyl points in WTe2, which is only 0.7% of the Brillouin zone.
3. The two possible space groups are the noncentrosymmetric Pmn21 space group or the centrosymmetric Pnmm space group. Previous X-ray diffraction studies were unable to conclusively distinguish between these two possibilities.

[Context] The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the second largest source of climate variability after the solar cycle. Its 2–7-year oscillations between positive (El Niño) and negative (La Niña) phases cause significant redistribution of heat and moisture fluxes across the planet with dramatic social and economic impacts. The impacts of ENSO, and in particular of strong El Niño events, are wide-ranging and can be devastating for societies and ecosystems, including, for example, changed incidence of disease, reduced agricultural yields, droughts and floods, changed incidence of tropical cyclones, fishery collapse and forest fires. As a result, the last few decades have seen a growing concern about how the climate system will respond to global warming.
[Question] What is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)?
Choices:
1. Understanding ENSO is critically important because its effects can be devastating for societies and ecosystems globally. ENSO has wide-ranging impacts on human health, food security, economies, and the environment. Scientists are actively studying ENSO to better predict its occurrence and effects, especially in the context of climate change and global warming. Accurate forecasting of ENSO phases can help communities better prepare for and mitigate its diverse impacts.
2. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a naturally occurring phenomenon involving fluctuating ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which affects the climate and weather patterns globally. It involves oscillations between warmer than usual (El Niño) and cooler than usual (La Niña) sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.
3. ENSO causes significant changes in global climate patterns by redistributing heat and moisture across the planet. During El Niño, unusually warm ocean temperatures in the eastern Pacific lead to increased rainfall in some parts of the world, while causing droughts in other areas. During La Niña, colder ocean temperatures cause opposite effects. The impacts of ENSO can include changes in disease incidence, agricultural yields, droughts, floods, tropical cyclones, fisheries, and forest fires.
4. The oscillations between El Niño and La Niña in the ENSO cycle are caused by variations in the wind patterns and ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. During El Niño, the trade winds weaken and warm water from the western Pacific moves eastward. During La Niña, the trade winds strengthen and colder water moves westward. This back-and-forth cycle typically occurs every 2 to 7 years.

[Context] The wood fiber cell wall is characterized by lignified primary (thin) and secondary (thick) walls with the latter composed structurally of three characteristic layers (S1, S2 and S3) constituting the major part of the xylem and lignocellulosic biomass. However, the structural organization of cell wall polymers is rather complex and there is still a gap in our understanding on both its structural complexity and the structure–function relationship at nano-meter level. Despite structural and chemical variations between different cell wall layers, the dominant secondary S2 layer of wood fiber walls is normally composed of three major biopolymers (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) molded into a complex, heterogeneous “3D biopolymer nanocomposite”. Cellulose (45–50% of dry weight) is united into microfibrils (MF) of ca 2–4 nm diameter with crystalline and amorphous regions and can exist as single or aggregate assemblies of MFs (also known as macrofibrils with reported diameters of 10–60 nm). Hemicelluloses (20–35% of dry weight) are short and branched chains composed of both homo- and heteropolymers. Lignin (15–32% of dry weight) is the second most abundant plant biopolymer after cellulose, and is considered an aromatic heteropolymer forming amorphous 3D network. The scaffold of cellulose (β-1-4-glucose) MFs in fiber secondary walls are thought surrounded by hemicellulose (mannose, xylose), whereas lignin is thought to mostly fill the gaps between cellulose MFs and/or MF aggregates.

[Context] Within the field of heterogeneous-catalyzed reactions such simulations have so far been mostly unfeasible due to the high computational cost of each PIMD step, as at least 10 replicas are usually required to achieve converged results—making the simulations prohibitively expensive.Nonetheless, there is clear evidence that NQEs may have a significant impact on the physicochemical properties of systems containing light atoms.For example, it is well-known that they can significantly affect the strength of hydrogen bonds in a variety of systems.NQEs have never been explicitly included in zeolite-related reactions and thus it remains unclear to what extent they would affect the rate of proton hopping and by extension any proton-transfer reactions within the field of zeolite catalysis..

[Context] In the present work, the new shaping mechanism was governed by small-scale, sharp modulations in swelling and mechanical properties of fiber-like structural components of the single-layer material.We designed a hydrogel sheet with periodic stripes of different compositions, passing at an oblique angle, θ, with respect to the long axis of the sheet.The critical design rule was such that an external stimulus induces a large difference in the swelling/shrinkage ratios and elastic moduli of the two types of stripes.The transformation of the planar sheet into a helix was driven solely by the reduction in stretching energy, and it yielded cylindrical helices with equally probable right- and left-handedness (an optional control over helix chirality was achieved by inducing a difference in hydrogel composition across the sheet thickness).In contrast with bending- or twist-mediated transitions reported by other groups, the shape transformations were mediated solely by in-plane forces and did not require a difference in structure or composition across the thickness of the sheet.The proposed mechanism was validated by the generation of cylindrical and conical helical structures with prescribed structural characteristics, by transitions between the two helical states with a different number of turns, and by multiple, distinct and stable shapes activated by different external stimuli.The method was robust and because of the small-scale chemically distinct structural units, it was suitable for the construction of multi-component, reconfigurable ‘digital materials’..

It is less complex compared to the mammalian system, while 60–80% of human disease genes have homologous genes in C. elegans. Additional characteristics that have contributed to its utility as a model include the ease of its genetic manipulability and maintenance, as well as its small size. Furthermore, due to its rapid life-cycle (about 3 days) and the ability to produce 300 offspring, high-throughput analyses is feasible. The aforementioned characteristics render a robust experimental model to investigate several pathways including oxidative stress, which is known to be a major contributor to several chronic human disorders. Since pathways relevant to oxidative stress and oxidative stress response are highly evolutionarily conserved in the nematode, the model has contributed greatly to the understanding of drug-mediated induction of oxidative stress and oxidative stress response as well as to the identification of upstream markers of oxidative stress within interconnected signaling pathways. Given that less is known about PTPMs of proteins conserved in C. elegans, this study was designed to show drug-mediated structural changes due to PTPMs of the redox-sensitive protein hTTR.

Amplification at this locus, which is detected in 40–50% of GBM tissues, is typically mosaic and believed to enhance pro-invasive signaling through EGFR. Interestingly, clinical imaging suggests this subset of receptor-amplified cells is enriched at the infiltrative tumor edge. Supporting these data, our ex vivo slice cultures demonstrated increased tumor cell migration in EGFR-amplified tumors, and blockade of EGFR signaling with the small molecule inhibitor, gefitinib, induced a statistically significant reduction in migratory behavior within the same sample set.

[Context] An alternative to the computationally demanding CSP is the use of methods such as CE which, in contrast to CSP, requires an a priori defined crystal structure. The expansion is carried out on one or multiple sublattices where parameterization is used to express the configurational dependence of physical properties such as energy, band gap, and magnetic interactions. CE has also been used to explore the configurational space in layered hexagonal MAX phases upon mixing of metals in 41 quaternary systems where the alloys were classified into three regimes—phase separation, weak ordering, and strong ordering. It was found that (V2/3Zr1/3)2AlC should phase segregate into V2AlC and Zr2AlC. This result, however, contradicts the experimental discovery of the in-plane ordered (V2/3Zr1/3)2AlC i-MAX phase. Note the structural differences between the MAX phase (which is the input for the CE model) and i-MAX phases, where the former has all atoms (V + Zr, Al, C) occupying hexagonal lattices while the latter combines honeycomb (for V), hexagonal (for Zr and C) and Kagomé-like (for Al) lattices. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the transformation from a hexagonal Al lattice to a Kagomé-like lattice gives rise to a significant decrease in energy for the material system. This combined with an unsuccessfully truncated CE model due to a limited number of considered training structures may explain the discrepancy in why CE fails to predict the correct outcome in ref. Such inconsistency demonstrates the importance of using an appropriately truncated CE model when studying the mixing of metals in MAX phases.
[Question] What are two methods that can be used to explore configurational space in materials?
Choices:
1. In MAX phases, all atoms occupy hexagonal lattices, while in i-MAX phases, the metals occupy honeycomb (V) and hexagonal (Zr) lattices, Al occupies a Kagomé-like lattice, and C occupies a hexagonal lattice. Also, transforming Al from hexagonal to Kagomé-like lattices significantly decreases the energy.
2. Cluster expansion was used to explore configurational space in 41 quaternary MAX phase systems upon mixing metals. The metals were mixed on the M sites of the MAX phases, which have a hexagonal lattice structure.
3. The cluster expansion model was likely too truncated, considering only a limited number of training structures. Also, it did not account for the structural change from MAX to i-MAX phases, which impacts the energies.

[Context] Reconstructions of dust provenance in past environments benefit from the geochemical differences between individual potential dust source areas (PSAs) and revealed that southern South American sources, and in particular Patagonia (south of 38°S), dominated the dust supply to East Antarctica during glacials. Yet, currently available Antarctic ice-core data do not unambiguously resolve specific terrestrial sources due to geochemical similarities between important dust sources in Australia, New Zealand, and South America, and/or analytical limitations resulting from the low abundance of lithogenic dust particles in Antarctic ice. Previous work from the South Pacific SAZ showed that the general pattern of glacial–interglacial variability in dust deposition resembles the characteristics of Antarctic ice-core records, with higher input during glacials compared to interglacial periods. The increased glacial dust supply to the South Pacific SAZ was ascribed to Australian and/or New Zealand sources synchronized with Patagonian dust emissions by large-scale common climate forcing. However, relatively little is known about sources and transport of dust to the glacial South Pacific SAZ comprising the largest area for oceanic CO2 sequestration through Fe fertilization in the Southern Hemisphere. Hence, characterizing the sources of dust input to the South Pacific SAZ during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is paramount to further understanding the role of the Southern Hemisphere dust cycle in the glacial drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Here we use a set of complementary, but independent geochemical tracers including rare earth elements (REEs), strontium (Sr), neodymium (Nd), and lead (Pb) isotopes to constrain sources and transport paths of dust delivered to the mid-latitude South Pacific during the LGM. Our data reveal remarkable changes in the geochemistry and spatial distribution of dust between the LGM and the Holocene, refining the existing picture of the glacial Southern Hemisphere dust cycle.
[Question] Why is it important to characterize dust sources to the South Pacific SAZ during the Last Glacial Maximum?

[Question] What is multimodal sensing and learning?
Choices:
1. Multimodal sensing and learning usually obtain data from different modes by elaborating or describing the same entity or spatiotemporal event in different modal spaces. These multi-modal descriptions can depict the multi-dimensional information of the same objective entity more comprehensively so as to improve the understanding and cognitive ability of the model.
2. With the development of the Internet of Things era, the requirements of the application scenarios and modal recognition of neuromorphic devices/systems tend to be diversified, and multi-modal/multi-task recognition has become an urgent task to improve the current new hardware architecture of artificial intelligence.
3. However, these electronic devices often require multiple input terminals for the acquisition of multiple modal information. Moreover, coupled auto-en/decoder and necessary peripheral circuit modules are required to realize the feature extraction and multimodal data fusion process, which imposes a significant burden on the production costs of large-scale applications.

[Context] Plum seeds are waste product that is generated from juice, food processing and cosmetic industries. Plum seeds produce over 50% of oil, this fruit is an important feed stock to produce biodiesel oil. The quality of biodiesel depends on the composition profile of fatty acids produced from the feedstock and is also important when we decide future biodiesel production possibilities. The plum processing industry can be an interesting source of alternative, inexpensive oily raw materials for biodiesel synthesis due to the world production and processing of plums and high oil content in grain. Total global plum production in 2013 amounted to 11.5 million tons and about 12 million tons in 2020. The oil content in plum grains (PK) ranges from 32% to even 45.9%, which is similar to sunflower and rapeseed oil (about 40%) but is higher than in soybean (about 20%). Biodiesel is best alternative available today to conventional diesel. Everyday introduction of improved methods of production in new alternative feedstocks are ever rapidly cementing biodiesel strong position as a mainstream alternative. There are several benefits of biodiesel including local production, rural development, environment friendly fuel and economically sound product as compared to conventional diesel. Why biodiesel did not attain that popularity which was expected due to its well-known so many benefits. Biodiesel production is viable only if produced from non-food crops. To make it further popular and competitive it is necessary to use non-food crops. It will not only reduce production costs but will also end food verses fuel debate. There are several clays including Bentonite, White pocha, Kolten and Sindh clays which are used in ceramic industry and available at very low cost. Granite stone powder is a waste product of stone processing industries and is a material available free of cost. All these materials were selected in the present study to prepare composite supports to hold catalyst potassium ferricyanide to produce biodiesel from non-edible waste seed oil of plum.
[Question] What are some low-cost non-food materials that can be used to produce biodiesel from plum seed oil?
Choices:
1. The text mentions several clay materials (Bentonite, White pocha, Kolten, Sindh clays) used in ceramics industry that are inexpensive and available. Granite stone powder is another waste material from stone processing that is free. These can be used to make composite catalyst supports to produce biodiesel from plum seed oil, which is also a waste material.
2. Plum seed oil is the oil that can be extracted from plum seeds, which are a waste product from juice, food processing and cosmetic industries. Plum seeds contain 32-45.9% oil, which is similar to or higher than oil content in other biodiesel feedstocks like sunflower, rapeseed and soybean. Therefore, plum seed oil is a promising, inexpensive and alternative feedstock for producing biodiesel.
3. The main reason biodiesel has not reached its expected popularity is because most productive feedstocks for biodiesel are food crops. Using food crops for fuel production raises concerns about fuel versus food availability. To increase adoption of biodiesel, it needs to be produced from non-food feedstocks which will reduce production costs and avoid fuel vs food debates.
4. Biodiesel has several benefits compared to conventional diesel fuel. First, it can be produced locally which aids rural development. Second, biodiesel is environmentally friendly and produces less emissions than conventional diesel. Third, biodiesel can be economically competitive with conventional diesel.

[Context] Research in this regard has led to the development of many self-healing elastomers with various healing mechanisms. One of the most common approaches to obtain self-healing elastomers is the physical crosslinking of flexible polymers with low glass transition temperature (Tg) via attractive and reversible interactions such as hydrogen bonds, dynamic covalent bonds, host–guest interactions, metal–ligand coordination, and ionic bonds and associations. These elastomers self-heal due to the reversibility of the physical crosslinks at the damaged faces. By moderately tuning the strength of the physical crosslinks, elastomers can autonomously self-heal at ambient temperature without requiring healing agents or external stimuli. Such elastomers are more practical to produce maintenance-free products. However, their design encounters a critical problem. a trade-off relationship between the strength and the autonomous healing speed of the material. This implies that stronger physical crosslinks provide stiffer and stronger materials, but the self-healing speed decreases because of the presence of less rearranging networks at the damaged faces. In such conventional designs, both the self-healing property and the strength depend on the exchangeable crosslinks, which is the main cause for the trade-off relationship.

A device with 0.4 M potassium bromide (KBr) and 0.1 M heptyl viologen (HV) provides a specific energy of 11 Wh kg at a specific power of 122 W kg (normalized to the total mass of both electrodes and electrolyte, with each electrode having a high mass loading of 12.9 mg cm), and shows negligible fade over 20,000 cycles and slower self-discharge than aq. control EDLCs without redox-active electrolyte. Using methyl viologen (MV) instead of HV provides higher energy density (∼14 Wh kg) due to higher solubility, but also faster self-discharge. The self-discharge mechanisms are studied by comparing the behaviour of redox electrolytes with varying chemical structure and molecular charge. Adsorption of the viologen and Br redox species to the activated carbon following charging is found to be important, and this effect enables 90% retention of stored energy after 6 h at open circuit.

[Context] The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of a Cas9 nuclease and a 100 nucleotides guide RNA (gRNA), which form a Cas9-gRNA complex, recognizing a 20 nucleotides target sequence with an NGG downstream protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, N20NGG) and induces a site-specific double-strand break (DSB). The success of genome editing depends on the choice of the gRNA sequence. Some gRNAs are capable of disrupting almost every target allele in a population of cells, while others display no detectable activity. This has led to development of several gRNA design tools for wild-type SpCas9 (WT-SpCas9) by using various algorithms, including linear regression model, penalized linear regression model, support vector machine (SVM) model, and gradient-boosted regression model. Intriguingly, two groups have recently shown that a convolutional neural network (CNN), a class of deep learning, improves gRNA design.

[Question] Why are metal-organic frameworks suggested as candidates for encapsulating biomacromolecules?
Choices:
1. The authors suggest hybrid organic-inorganic materials would provide a more versatile and general method for encapsulating biomacromolecules because, in general, the protein domains have a high affinity for the organic moieties in hybrid materials.
2. Developing a method for encapsulating bioactive molecules is important because it would significantly increase the potential for using functional biomacromolecules in applications where enhanced thermal stability, tolerance to organic solvents, or extended shelf-lifetime is required, such as industrial catalysis and biopharmaceutical delivery.
3. Seeding an inorganic architecture like a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell at an organic interface presents a significant challenge. Enhancing the interfacial interactions between inorganic and organic components is key to inducing biomineralization.
4.

Noteworthy, the deactivation of 2D-Mo2COx/SiO2 under DRM conditions can be avoided by optimizing the contact time. Density functional theory calculations corroborate experimental observations and demonstrate that the DRM pathway on an oxycarbidic surface with a submonolayer oxygen coverage is energetically favored compared to the pathway occurring on a fully carbidic surface. The fully oxygen-covered surface is unstable in DRM conditions and reduces in situ its oxygen coverage below 1 oxygen monolayer, also consistent with our experiments.

It facilitates the production of a large number of seedlings for seaweed cultivation and genetic engineering within a short period of time, eliminating the need for laborious seedling collection from natural beds. STC is unique among in vitro culture techniques. however, progress in the field is lagging far behind that of land plants because of a lack of genomic information. Callus formation has been reported in some species of Gracilariales, including G. verrucosa, G. textorii, G. vermiculophylla, G. tenuifrons, G. chilensis, G. tenuistipitata, G. perplexa, G. corticata and G. domingensis. However, in most species, callus formation does not occur often and cannot be controlled easily, as in higher plants through the introduction of exogenous plant hormones. Despite the addition of auxins and cytokinins (CTK) alone or in combination, regeneration from callus is difficult. Furthermore, the main morphological response of explants of Gracilariales to in vitro culture is the direct production of adventitious branches (ABs) within a shorter period of time than that required for callus formation as a result of wounding, as reported for G. blodgettii, Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis, G. tenuistipitata, G. asiatica, G. vermiculophylla, G. domingensis and G. changii. Similar results were reported for Gelidiales, Halymeniales, Ceramiales and Gigartinales, which illustrates cell totipotency and is an alternative morphological response that could be used for seedling production instead of thallus regeneration from callus.

We therefore cloned a single isoform of Ca-α1T, expressed it in Xenopus oocytes or HEK-293 cells and compared its biophysical properties with those of the rat T-type channel Cav3.1. We also generated several Ca-α1T mutant alleles and identified a defect in their sleep/wake cycles. Contrary to results in mammals, the fly T-type Ca channel destabilizes sleep.

Liquid I of TPP is a typical fragile liquid, but becomes stronger as LLT proceeds, and the final liquid II is as strong as B2O3. Very recently, we also found that miscibility with other liquids is different between liquid I and II.

TEMPO(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical)-mediated oxidation is generally considered to be one of the most efficient methods to modify the wood fibers. By introducing carboxyl groups in the C6 of cellulose during TEMPO oxidation, wood fibers tend to easily collapse and form a densely packed fiber network due to weak interfibrillar hydrogen bonds in the fiber cell wall induced by strong electrostatic repulsive forces.
[Question] What are some of the desirable properties that paper made from wood pulp can display?
Choices:
1. The introduced carboxyl groups induce weak interfibrillar hydrogen bonds in the fiber cell wall. This is due to strong electrostatic repulsive forces caused by the carboxyl groups. Therefore, the fibers tend to collapse and form a densely packed fiber network.
2. Paper made from wood pulp can display properties such as being transparent or opaque, porous or hermetic, rough or ultra-smooth, flexible or rigid, fragile or tough.
3. Wood pulp, primarily constituting cellulose, can be used to fabricate transparent, hazy and flexible glass without damaging the glass surface.
4. TEMPO-mediated oxidation is the oxidation of wood fibers using the TEMPO radical (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl). It introduces carboxyl groups in the C6 position of cellulose during the oxidation. This causes the wood fibers to easily collapse and form a densely packed fiber network.

We then examine the relationship between average net primary production (NPP) and ZB estimated during the survey, and provide a first-order estimate of the global contribution of zooplankton to carbon cycling in the deep sea. Additional support for the role of zooplankton metabolism at depth was provided by the analysis of nitrogen stable isotope composition of zooplankton and estimations of respiration from enzymatic assays in Malaspina samples (see “Methods”). We found independent and globally coherent positive relationships between ZB in the meso-, and bathypelagic layers of the ocean and average NPP in the overlying photic layer. The relationships obtained imply that increased primary productivity in the euphotic layer leads to enhanced transference of organic carbon to the deep ocean. Estimated remineralization from respiration rates by deep-sea zooplankton requires a minimum supply of 0.44 Pg C y transported into the bathypelagic ocean, comparable to the magnitude of passive carbon sequestration, which itself is required to support deep-sea microbial carbon demands. Thus, we suggest that the global coupling between primary production and bathypelagic ZB must be supported by passive carbon supply, including episodic events of high carbon delivery, as well as an important contribution from an active transport mechanism associated to vertical zooplankton migration.

In nature, vitamin E is exclusively synthesized in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, and tocotrienols are relatively rarer distributed in nature sources and generally found in the seeds of monocotyledons and fruits of some dicotyledons. Currently, natural tocotrienols are mainly derived from crude palm oil which contains up to 800 mg/kg of tocotrienols. Recently, metabolic engineering efforts in soybean seeds have turned soybean into a viable platform for producing high levels of vitamin E tocochromanols. Meanwhile, recent advances in synthetic biology have enabled heterologous biosynthesis of various natural products in model microorganisms. The synthetic pathway of vitamin E has been determined by mutational analysis and in vitro enzyme characterization, which lays basis for its heterologous biosynthesis. The first effort on microbial biosynthesis of vitamin E tocochromanols produced 15 μg/g DCW of δ-tocotrienol in engineered Escherichia coli.

Additionally, SPPs bound to the surface of graphene exhibits unique features such as high modal index, relatively low loss and flexible tunability by electric field and magnetic field. Herein, we propose a simple strategy to fabricate high-performance NIRPDs by coating SiNWs array with AuNPs decorated graphene. The as-fabricated device exhibits obvious sensitivity to 850 nm light illumination with an on/off ratio of 10, the highest value compared with other Si based devices. Theoretical simulation based on finite element method (FEM) reveals that the high performance can be ascribed to the excellent optical property of AuNPs@graphene/SiNWs array which as a highly efficient SPP-based NIR light coupling system, is capable of trapping the incident NIR light into the SiNWs array through SPP excitation and coupling in the AuNPs decorated graphene layer. The generality of the above result suggests that our NIRPD will have potential application in future optoelectronic devices.

[Context] While human raters can achieve levels of agreement above 90% when identifying instances of eye contact in PoV videos, the accuracy of automated detection approaches achieved in prior works is well below this level of performance, making automatic coding unusable by researchers and practitioners as a measurement tool. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring three directions. First, we hypothesize that modern deep learning architectures can leverage a large dataset of 4.7M human-annnotated eye contact events to achieve higher accuracy. However, while our dataset is large by any standard, it only contains around 100 unique subjects. In contrast, datasets for face detection, recognition, and other tasks, which have been shown to yield high performance when using deep models, contain orders of magnitude more variability. Therefore, our second hypothesis is that we can close this gap by using task transfer learning from additional datasets that model the relationship between head pose and eye gaze direction, which is central to our task. Transfer learning is based on leveraging representations learned for one task to improve performance on a related task. Third, we hypothesize that the frequency and duration of moments of eye contact identified by our automated method will correlate with measures of social impairment among individuals with ASD. Establishing this hypothesis validates the feasibility of fully automated eye contact coding using our approach.

[Context] By contrast, the spinel (magnetite) family, another important class of complex oxides, usually exhibits relatively high magnetic ordering temperatures, large net magnetization, and stable chemistry property. Besides, the intricate interplay of spin, charge, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom brings them rich and complex physics, including Verwey transition, Jahn–Teller effect, spiral spin-liquid state, and magnetostriction. Cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, CFO) is unique among the spinel ferrites in that it owns sizeable magnetic anisotropy due to a spin-orbit stabilized ground state. Nevertheless, the synthesis of desirable non-van der Waals ultrathin complex oxides is still in its infancy because the inherent three-dimensional chemically bonded nature hinders their layer-by-layer exfoliation and 2D anisotropic growth. Recently, Kum et al. developed a remote epitaxy method of synthesizing CFO single-crystalline membranes with thickness of ~100 nm using pulsed laser deposition (PLD), providing a step towards 2D ferrites research. But, restricted by the rigorous condition such as lattice-matched substrates and ultra-high vacuum, MBE and PLD method cannot be widely used in production. Besides, it will be interesting to explore whether the intrinsic magnetic order survives at a finite temperature in the 2D limit. Therefore, a facile and scalable approach (i. e., high throughput, low cost, transferability, and, importantly, compatibility with mature semiconductor technologies) to synthesize atomically thin spinel crystals is of significant importance for further development of the field.
[Question] What is an open question regarding ultrathin CFO that requires further research?

[Context] A crucial step in using NMR to measure unfolding is the selection of suitable resonances. The main problems are linked to the nature of the resonances and to their position inside the protein. A common practice is to use the amide groups in N-labelled samples. In principle, all NH resonances could be used to monitor the unfolding process but in practice there are several limitations. Amide protons, also when only partially exposed to water, undergo exchange with the water and this may influence the results in several ways. The second problem, i. e., the position of the NH group with respect to the protein surface, is only partially related to proton exchange. Even more important is the relationship with the mechanism of unfolding. When monitoring unfolding of a well structure single domain protein with other spectroscopic techniques, e. g., CD spectroscopy, one observes intensity changes related to the whole secondary structure elements (helices and/or beta sheets) whereas the changes of NMR volumes reflect changes of single atoms and indirectly their location on the protein. The position of the atom in the protein architecture may reflect cooperative unfolding only if the atom is well inside the hydrophobic core. On the contrary, if the atom is positioned on external structural elements, volume changes may reflect peripheral motions.
[Question] How does monitoring unfolding by NMR differ from other techniques like CD spectroscopy?
Choices:
1. The position is important because it relates to the mechanism of unfolding. NH groups in the hydrophobic core reflect cooperative unfolding across secondary structure elements like helices and sheets. But NH groups on the surface may just show local peripheral motions, not cooperative unfolding.
2. According to the text, ideal NH groups to monitor are those well inside the hydrophobic core of the protein. These will reflect cooperative unfolding across the protein structure. Surface NH groups may just show local peripheral motions.
3. The main problems are linked to the nature of the amide resonances and their position inside the protein. First, amide protons can undergo exchange with water even when only partially exposed, which can influence the results. Second, the position of the NH group with respect to the protein surface is important, beyond just proton exchange. NH groups on the surface may reflect peripheral motions rather than cooperative unfolding.
4. CD sees intensity changes related to entire secondary structure elements like helices and sheets. But NMR sees volume changes of individual atoms, so it reflects the location of those atoms in the protein structure. Only atoms in the hydrophobic core reflect cooperative unfolding.

[Context] The abnormal secretion of adipokines induces the recruitment and invasion of B cells, T cells, and subsequently macrophages to the adipose tissue. After infiltration, IFN-γ and IL-17 secreting T-cells stimulate the proinflammatory activation of adipocyte tissue macrophages (ATM’s). Necrotic white adipose tissue, a hallmark of obesity, is also a major driver for macrophage infiltration. Over 90% of ATMs have been shown to accumulate and surround dead adipocytes, forming a crown-like structure that is associated with increased TNFα and IL-6 secretion. Additionally, adipocytes release free fatty acids, which interacts with ATM Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), triggering the activation of the pro-inflammatory Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. Subsequent to the activation of the NF-κB cascade, the secretion of other adipokines are further stimulated, notably monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), a cytokine that promotes the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflammation site.

[Context] Optoacoustic (OA) imaging, based on optical excitation and ultrasound detection, represents a promising solution to the above limitations, as it is a powerful molecular imaging modality owing to the unique combination of high spatio-temporal resolution, deep penetration and spectrally-enriched contrast. This method therefore offers many possibilities for labeling strategies. Moreover, because the detection of ultrasound is not limited by photon scattering, it enables scalable high-resolution imaging deep in the tissue (20–200 µm). In particular, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) was proven to be effective for preclinical imaging of tumors in small animals and has been implemented in a handheld clinical system for tumor assessment. MSOT is regularly used to detect contrast from endogenous absorbers such as hemoglobin, lipids and water, or from exogenous absorbers such as dyes or nanoparticles. Labeling bacteria with transgene fluorescent or chromoproteins for detection in OA has however thus far proven unsuccessful due to weak acoustic signals and often poor photostability, limiting sensitivity and observation time. photo-switching chromoproteins provide a promising alternative but their development and use are still in its infancy. In contrast, a particularly strong OA signal can be generated by expressing the gene encoding tyrosinase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the production of melanin, a strong contrast agent for OA imaging.
[Question] What is multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and how has it been applied?
Choices:
1. The text explains that MSOT utilizes multiple wavelengths of light, enabling the detection of various endogenous absorbers like hemoglobin and lipids, or exogenous absorbers like dyes and nanoparticles. This spectral information, combined with ultrasound detection that is not limited by photon scattering, allows MSOT to achieve high resolution imaging deep into tissue, making it effective for preclinical tumor imaging.
2. Using fluorescent or chromoproteins to label bacteria for detection with OA imaging has thus far proven unsuccessful. This is due to the weak acoustic signals generated and often poor photostability of these proteins, which limits both the sensitivity for detection and the observation time.

The NTD and CTD are also flanked by flexible ends. The NTD is implicated in the binding and melting of regulatory elements required for transcription initiation, whereas the CTD drives protein dimerization and is thought to contribute to the binding of the RNA packaging signal (PS) sequence during virus particle assembly.

2. The need to change the chemical structure to vary the mechanical properties presents the central dogma in these materials that has made it difficult to decouple the effects of chemistry and mechanical properties.

[Context] In an ideal Hall-effect sensor, the deflection of electric current in an out-of-plane magnetic field B produces a transverse (Hall) voltage response VH = BI/(ne) = IRHB, where I is the bias current, n is the two-dimensional charge carrier density, e is the electron charge, and RH = I(∂VH/∂B) is the Hall coefficient.This voltage response and the Hall voltage noise SV combined give the magnetic field detection limit SB = SV/(IRH).The quantity SB multiplied by the square root of the measurement bandwidth gives the smallest detectable change in magnetic field.Thermal Johnson noise, which is independent of frequency and proportional to the square root of the device resistance, provides a fundamental lower bound for the voltage noise.The desire to minimize Johnson noise suggests that the ideal material system for Hall sensors combines low carrier density for a large Hall coefficient and high carrier mobility for a low device resistance.However, contributions from flicker (“1/f”) noise and random telegraph noise often dominate the total noise at practically relevant kHz frequencies, requiring individual characterization of each material system..
[Question] What produces the Hall voltage in an ideal Hall-effect sensor?
Choices:
1. The Hall voltage response VH is determined by the bias current I, the magnetic field B, the electron charge e, and the two-dimensional charge carrier density n, according to the relation VH = BI/(ne).
2. The Hall voltage noise SV combined with the Hall voltage response VH gives the magnetic field detection limit SB = SV/(IRH). The quantity SB multiplied by the square root of the measurement bandwidth gives the smallest detectable change in magnetic field.

[Context] Myofibroblasts are responsible for excessive ECM synthesis and deposition in fibrotic tissues. Myofibroblasts are rare in normal tissues and are differentiated from multiple cell types such as resident fibroblasts, upon inflammation. Their differentiation is triggered by humoral factors secreted by immune cells at the inflammation site, like transforming growth factor (TGF)-β which activates Smad signalling. Differentiated myofibroblasts produce excessive collagens, which accumulate in tissues and cause hardening. For example, the elastic modulus of a healthy rat heart is about 10 kPa, but in a fibrotic rat heart, it increases to about 50 kPa, resulting in decreased contractility. Myofibroblasts recognise collagen-induced matrix stiffness through receptors like integrins, which activate Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signalling and actin polymerisation. Actin cytoskeletal formation promotes the expression of ECM proteins. Thus, hardening plays an important role in maintaining myofibroblast differentiation, and generates feedback loops that accelerate collagen deposition. However, the molecular mechanisms by which matrix stiffness increases fibrosis-related gene expression in myofibroblasts remain largely unknown.
[Question] How does increased matrix stiffness maintain the myofibroblast phenotype?
Choices:
1. Myofibroblasts can detect changes in matrix stiffness through receptors like integrins. Integrins activate Rho/Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling and actin polymerization when they bind to stiffer matrices.
2. The excessive ECM deposited by myofibroblasts leads to tissue hardening and increased matrix stiffness. This stiff matrix is recognized by myofibroblast integrins, creating a positive feedback loop. The increased matrix stiffness promotes further myofibroblast differentiation and ECM production through integrin/Rho/ROCK signaling.
3. Increased matrix stiffness promotes the expression of ECM proteins like collagen in myofibroblasts through activation of signaling pathways like Rho/ROCK. This results in further ECM deposition and creates positive feedback loops that accelerate collagen deposition and tissue fibrosis.
4. Myofibroblasts express integrin receptors that can recognize and bind to collagen and other ECM proteins. This integrin binding activates Rho/ROCK signaling and actin cytoskeleton formation in myofibroblasts. The actin cytoskeleton further promotes expression of ECM proteins like collagens.

Specifically, we advance a new comprehensive multi-physics study of the complex phenomena behind the SPPD operation. A numerical framework is developed which self-consistently solves the Maxwell’s, Poisson-Boltzmann, drift-diffusion and heat equations. This model allows for accurate simulations of the excitation and electro-optical control of the SPPs, the minority carrier transport across the PN.- junction, the spatially and time dependent local permittivity variations under external bias, and introduction of thermal effects due to Ohmic heating and electromagnetic energy dissipation.

[Context] ΔH is affected by the interaction forces between the molecular chains. Irregularity in the chains (e. g. co-monomer), small crystals and crystal imperfections result in smaller ΔH, and consequently, lower Tm. Drawn and longer molecular chains (typically for drawn polymer fibers) give larger interaction forces that increase ΔH and thereby Tm.ΔS is determined by the conformational possibilities of the molecular chains. If a polymer has an oriented molecular structure, the polymer tries to set back its isotropic structure upon heating, and relaxation and shrinkage occur. If relaxation is hampered (e. g. the fibers are fixed and their length cannot change), ΔS remains small, and Tm is higher. This phenomenon is called the overheating effect. Barkoula et al. studied the overheating effect for apolar (polyethylene and PP) and polar (polyamide 6 and polyethylene terephthalate) polymer fibers prepared with a home-built lab-scale melt-spinning device and concluded that the overheating effect is smaller for polar (8–10 °C) than apolar (20–25 °C) polymers. They produced PP fibers with different post-drawing temperatures and draw ratios and pointed out that the post-drawing temperature is the most beneficial around 140 °C and a draw ratio below 10 did not affect the morphology, thereby the melting temperature. At a higher draw ratio, λ = 14, there was a shift of 10 °C if the fiber was constrained.
[Question] How did Barkoula et al. study the overheating effect in different polymer fibers?
Choices:
1. Irregularity in the molecular chains, such as from co-monomers or small crystals and crystal imperfections, results in smaller interaction forces between the chains. This leads to a smaller enthalpy of fusion ΔH and consequently a lower melting temperature Tm for the polymer.
2. The overheating effect refers to an increase in the melting temperature Tm when relaxation and shrinkage of an oriented polymer structure is constrained upon heating. Restricting the conformational freedom of the chains keeps the entropy of fusion ΔS small, resulting in a higher Tm.
3. Barkoula et al. produced polypropylene fibers with different post-drawing temperatures and draw ratios. They found the optimal post-drawing temperature was around 140°C. Increasing the draw ratio above 10 did not affect the fiber morphology or Tm. However, at a high draw ratio of 14, constraining the fiber led to a 10°C increase in melting temperature due to the overheating effect.
4. Barkoula et al. prepared apolar (polyethylene, polypropylene) and polar (polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate) polymer fibers using a lab-scale melt-spinning device. They constrained the fibers to prevent relaxation and shrinkage during heating. They found a smaller overheating effect for the polar vs. apolar polymers, with increases in Tm of 8-10°C and 20-25°C respectively.

[Context] Classical entanglement may also be distinguished from quantum entanglement in that it does not exhibit quantum nonlocality. However, partitioning of classical waves outside the spatial domain can co-locate the subsystems in the same physical space, obviating the issue of distance dependent interactions. Finally, classically entangled superpositions of states involve directly measurable complex coefficients that are amplitudes (with phase) in contrast to quantum superpositions which coefficients are probability amplitudes obeying the Born rule. Consequently, classically entanglement superpositions of states are not susceptible to decoherence.
[Question] What is the difference between the coefficients in classically entangled superpositions versus quantum superpositions?
Choices:
1. Decoherence arises in quantum systems when entanglement with the environment causes superposition states to decay into mixtures. However, classically entangled superpositions have directly measurable amplitudes, rather than probabilistic superpositions. So they do not experience decoherence effects.
2. The key difference is that classical entanglement does not exhibit quantum nonlocality, which means that the subsystems in a classically entangled system can be located in the same physical space. Quantum entanglement, on the other hand, can exhibit nonlocal correlations between subsystems that are spatially separated.
3. In classically entangled superpositions, the coefficients are complex amplitudes with a measurable phase. In quantum superpositions, the coefficients are probability amplitudes that obey the Born rule and cannot be directly measured.

[Context] OGA contains an N-terminal catalytic domain with sequence homology to glycoside hydrolase family 84 (GH84), a stalk domain, and a C-terminal pseudo-histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain. Previous biochemical and structural investigations on OGA bacterial homologs provided substantial insights into the mechanism of O-GlcNAc hydrolysis in the catalytic site. However, the sequences of OGA’s stalk domain and HAT domain bear significant variations from the bacterial homologs, therefore, how OGA recognizes diverse substrates beyond the catalytic pocket remains elusive. Recently, our group and others have independently identified crystallizable constructs of OGA that comprise the catalytic domain and stalk domain, and published the apo form structures and enzyme complexes with active site inhibitors. These reports consistently showed that OGA formed an unusual arm-in-arm homodimer, where the catalytic domain of one monomer covered by the stalk domain of the sister monomer to create a potential substrate-binding cleft. We further determined the structure of OGA in complex with a p53 glycopeptide and provided a direct view into the substrate-binding state of this glycosidase. Notably, we found that the p53 glycopeptide was tightly bound in the substrate-binding cleft through abundant contacts of GlcNAc in the OGA catalytic pocket, and via peptide side chain and backbone interactions with cleft surface residues. These observations suggest that besides the GlcNAc moiety, OGA enables recognition of specific features of substrate peptides. It has been reported that OGA can hydrolyze O-GlcNAc from a broad range of peptide sequences, but it is unclear whether OGA binds all glycopeptides in the same orientation or conformation. In the present study, we aim to assess the generality of the substrate-binding mode of OGA and to extend our understanding on the principle of OGA substrate recognition.

It was also shown that efficient intramolecular photostabilization can be achieved without additives in the buffer system, minimizing potential influences on the biological system of interest. Applications of intramolecular photostabilization in biophysical or microscopy research are, however, still limited to proof-of-principle studies. This is mainly due to the synthetic effort of photostabilizer–dye conjugates, which thus far requires a multi-step synthesis route. These synthetic challenges represent a fundamental hurdle for researchers with limited organic chemistry experience to use this concept. Moreover, only a small number of bifunctional cyanine derivatives are currently available to synthesize photostabilizer–dye conjugates on specific biomolecular targets (DNA, RNA, proteins and antibodies), strongly restricting the choice of fluorophore type (chemical structure, redox potential, water solubility and so on) and photophysical properties (colour, brightness, fluorescence lifetime and so on). Especially the available cyanine fluorophores suffer from limited brightness and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to cis/trans isomerization, a fact that emphasizes the urgent need for a synthetic strategy to study and use other classes of organic fluorophores via intramolecular photostabilization.

[Context] The distribution of PW and AW has important consequences for the shelf ecosystem across the Greenland shelf. Regions more influenced by AW generally show higher productivity due to the higher concentration of nitrate, while especially the NEGS has low overall productivity due to limited nitrate in PW and delayed spring blooms due to sea ice coverage. Increased advection of AW or increased vertical mixing could directly increase the nitrate available to sustain phytoplankton production with potential cascading effects through the food web. Because PW and AW have different origin and temperature, the two water masses also contain species with different biogeographic affinity. Increased abundance of boreal species on the East and West Greenland shelf have been linked to changes in water mass distribution. The importance of changes in water masses for ecosystems is very apparent in the Barents Sea, where a distinct increase in AW presence has reduced sea ice cover, changed species distributions, and transformed ecosystem structure. Since AW is also important for the NEGS we aim to answer if the Atlantification observed elsewhere has propagated to the NEGS. For this purpose, we consolidate previously disparate summer measurements of oceanographic conditions over the period 1923 to 2019 from the NEGS to reveal recent trends in selected fjords and place these in the context of hydrographic changes of the adjacent NEGS waters. Our analysis, which is restricted to waters up to 100 km from the coast, finds significant changes in core PW and AW properties and their vertical distribution during the last two decades. There are, however, distinct latitudinal differences of which the impact on upper ocean stratification is quantified and potential implications of these changes for the NEGS ecosystem are discussed.

2. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies target the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1. PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells that can be engaged by PD-L1 expressed on tumour cells and antigen presenting cells to inhibit T cell activation and anti-tumour immune responses. By blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, these antibodies relieve the suppression of anti-tumour immunity.
3. PD-1 stands for programmed death-1. It is a receptor found on immune cells called T cells. When PD-1 binds to its ligand PD-L1, it suppresses the anti-tumor immune response of T cells. By blocking the PD-1 receptor or its ligand PD-L1 using monoclonal antibodies, the suppression of T cells can be relieved, allowing them to attack and kill tumor cells more effectively.

[Context] A new modality of PDT for treating tumors in deeply located organs is therefore needed. One new modality that has been focused on is metronomic PDT(mPDT), in which the photosensitizer is administered repeatedly and light is irradiated during an extended period at low fluence rates, resulting in apoptosis-dominant cell death. The key to the therapeutic efficacy of mPDT is that the number of tumor cells dying over time must exceed the tumor's regrowth rate. This implies that mPDT with a single administration of photosensitizer and low-intensity light irradiation for a long time will not induce adequate tumor cell death to achieve tumor control.

Cas9 with a crRNA targeting a particular resistance gene is used to cut plasmids into their linear configuration. We then stain the DNA with YOYO and netropsin and visualize where the double-strand breaks (dsbreaks) occurs along the barcodes by stretching the linearized plasmids in nanochannels. If a majority of the dsbreaks occur at the same position along the barcode, the targeted sequence is present on the plasmid (). We demonstrate the assay on several important resistance genes including the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene family blaCTX-M (group 1 and group 9), and the carbapenemase gene families blaNDM and blaKPC. These groups of beta-lactamases represent the currently largest clinical problem among enteric bacteria and are therefore essential resistance genes to screen for in a clinical situation. We present studies on the clinically relevant case where there is more than one plasmid present in each isolate and also discuss how to confirm that the results are statistically valid. The assay has potential applications ranging all the way from fundamental plasmid biology to epidemiological tracing of plasmids and clinical diagnostics. We discuss how the assay can be optimized for clinical use by combining several gRNAs that identify different genes that give resistance to the same group of antibiotics. Importantly, the assay does not require any additional labeling apart from YOYO and netropsin, and the complexity of the sample preparation, data collection and data analysis compared to the optical mapping assay in its original format is kept at a minimum. We have thus integrated several important parameters that are traditionally used for plasmid identification, including size determination and gene identification, in one single assay that furthermore gives a fingerprint of the plasmid that can be used for further plasmid characterization and tracing ().
[Question] How can the results of the assay be confirmed to be statistically valid?
Choices:
1. Wild-type Cas9 loaded with a crRNA targeting a specific resistance gene is used to create double-strand breaks at that gene sequence in plasmids.
2. The text states the results should be validated by confirming that the majority of double-strand breaks occur at the same position along the plasmid barcodes. This indicates the targeted sequence is consistently present.
3. These beta-lactamase gene families represent the largest current clinical problem among enteric bacteria and are essential to screen for in clinical situations.
4. The plasmids are linearized at the break sites. The DNA is stained with YOYO and netropsin and then stretched in nanochannels. This allows visualization of where the breaks occur along the barcodes on the plasmids.

[Context] In the here presented concept, the piezoelectric thin film inside the gate structure of the PiezoFET responds to a mechanical deformation with a polarisation. For the encoding of the signal into spikes, a Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) approach is used. Here, the focus was on the development of a circuitry comprising just few components. Therefore, the LIF neuron model we use does not model the conductance of ion channels explicitly. In order to generate spikes, a negative differential resistance is used which is based on the positive feedback coupling of two transistors. This is a difference to other concepts like the spike based readout of the POSFET. In the following, we present the PiezoFET in more detail. Subsequently, the entire unit including the spike generation circuit is described. This encompasses a short introduction of the used neuron model as well as numerical results on the proposed spiking and adapting circuit.

[Context] Lights, especially blue light (BL) and red light (RL), are important environmental signals for various organisms of plants because they regulate plant developmental and physiologic processes though photoreceptors, and play major roles in the action spectra for energy sources of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation that can provide great impacts on plant growth. Light-emitting diodes (LED) are semiconductor device which can emit light with various wavelengths, and perform better energy efficiency and lower cost than high-pressure sodium lamps.

[Context] Besides its primase activity, PrimPol is capable of bypassing some DNA lesions in vitro suggesting that PrimPol may perform DNA translesion synthesis (TLS). PrimPol efficiently bypasses 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), 5-formyluracil, O-methylguanine and abasic site in the presence of Mg ions. In Mn-catalyzed reactions, PrimPol synthesizes through additional blocking lesions such as 1,N-ethenoadenine and thymine glycol. PrimPol also bypasses UV-induced lesions. cis-syn T–T dimers (CPD) and T–T (6–4) photoproducts. It was suggested that PrimPol can “skip” blocking DNA lesions rather than incorporate dNMPs opposite these DNA adducts (so-called “pseudo-TLS” or the template “scrunching” mechanism). It is believed that the primase activity is the primary function of PrimPol in cells but, if a complex damage is present, the situation is possible when during de novo DNA synthesis PrimPol encounters a DNA lesion, and the TLS activity of PrimPol might contribute to the DNA damage tolerance. PrimPol binding to DNA and its activity can be regulated by accessory proteins. replication protein A (RPA) and DNA polymerase δ-interacting protein 2 (PolDIP2).

[Context] Both within- and trans-generational defense plasticity should be costly, because organisms need an allocation of energy, or resource, to form defensive traits, which in turn reduces the energy or resources that can be used for other purposes, i. e., development or reproduction. This conflict should have important implication for pest management, as predator-induced phenotypic plasticity alters the development, survival, reproduction, population dynamics, and interspecific interactions of pests, resulting in profound and broad consequences not only on pest communities, but also on the whole agroecosystems.

[Question] What are photonic crystals (PCs)?
Choices:
1. Some extraordinary optical properties of photonic crystals include: 1) Supporting high quality factor (high-Q) supercavity modes that confine light very effectively due to their near-zero radiation losses to free space 2) Tailorable dispersion relations and wavevector-domain modulation transfer functions enabling applications like k-space filtering, image differentiation and hyperspectral imaging.
2. Photonic crystals (PCs) are nanostructured dielectric surfaces that consist of subwavelength periodic structures that resonate with photons. This results in light confinement and the formation of a photonic band structure, similar to how electronic band structures arise in crystalline solids due to the periodic potential experienced by electrons.
3. Unlike plasmonic nanostructures which rely on coupling light to free electron oscillations, photonic crystals utilize subwavelength periodic dielectric structures to interact with light. A key difference is that plasmonic structures suffer from inherent material absorption losses, whereas photonic crystals can exhibit extraordinary optical properties without these losses.
4. A quasi-bound state in the continuum (BIC) refers to a high-Q supercavity mode supported by certain photonic crystals with specific topological symmetries. These modes have near-zero radiation leakage into free space resulting in extremely high quality factors and light confinement. They are called quasi-BICs since they are embedded in the continuum of radiating modes but behave as if they are bound states.

[Context] While MoS2 has been the most extensively investigated TMD for device applications, the higher optical absorbance of MoSe2 suggests that MoSe2 could be more suitable than MoS2 for the application of phototransistors. However, little attention has been given to the optoelectronic properties of MoSe2 phototransistors, which has been less impressive than those of MoS2 phototransistors (responsivity.0.01–238 AW, response time.5–400 ms). Therefore, in this study, we explore the optoelectronic properties of MoSe2 phototransistors fabricated with mechanically-exfoliated multilayer flakes on SiO2/Si substrates. Our best-performance MoSe2 phototransistor in a simple bottom-gate thin-film transistor configuration exhibits high responsivity (~1.4 × 10 AW) and fast response time (~1.7 ms) under 650-nm-laser surpassing previously reported MoSe2 phototransistors. We also investigate the dependence of photocurrent on gate voltage and optical power density to describe the device operation based on photoconductive and photogating effects. These results demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high performance in MoSe2 phototransistors without complicated device structures, suggesting that the performance of MoSe2 phototransistors could be further enhanced by the combination of optimized device architecture and processing.
[Question] What were the key results demonstrated with the MoSe2 phototransistor fabricated in this study?

[Context] A Gram-positive bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, exhibits MDR when exposed to increasing concentrations of structurally unrelated toxic compounds, such as Hoechst 33342 (H33342), daunomycin, ethidium and rhodamine 6G (Rho6G) (). The MDR phenotype is induced by the overexpression of a heterodimeric multidrug transporter, LmrCD. The expression of LmrCD is regulated by a multidrug transcriptional repressor, LmrR, which is encoded in the same gene cluster as the lmrCD gene. LmrR is a homodimeric protein that belongs to the PadR-like family of multidrug transcriptional regulators. In the absence of the compound, LmrR binds to the promoter regions of the lmrCD genes to repress their transcription (). When the cells are exposed to the toxic compounds, LmrR is released from the promoter regions to induce membrane expression of the transporter. LmrR has been shown to bind the aforementioned compounds with relatively high affinities, thus, is a major sensory molecule that controls multidrug resistance in L. lactis.

Choices:
1. LmrR has been shown to bind the compounds such as Hoechst 33342, daunomycin, ethidium and rhodamine 6G with relatively high affinities. Therefore, LmrR is considered a major sensory molecule that controls multidrug resistance in Lactococcus lactis.

[Context] A Japanese phase III clinical trial evaluated high-dose pirfenidone (1800 mg/day), low-dose (1200 mg/day), and placebo and reported that the low-dose group showed a significant effect on disease progression assessed by FVC decline compared with the placebo group. However, the effects of pirfenidone less than 1200 mg/day dose have not been confirmed.
[Question] How was disease progression assessed in the clinical trial?
Choices:
1. In the clinical trial, disease progression was assessed by looking at the decline in FVC (forced vital capacity). FVC decline was used as the measure to compare the effects of the different pirfenidone doses versus placebo on disease progression.
2. The purpose of the Japanese phase III clinical trial was to evaluate different doses of pirfenidone for the treatment of a disease. Specifically, the trial compared a high dose of 1800 mg/day, a low dose of 1200 mg/day, and a placebo. The goal was to assess the effects of different pirfenidone doses on disease progression.
3. The key finding was that the low dose pirfenidone group (receiving 1200 mg/day) showed a significant effect on disease progression compared to the placebo group, as measured by less decline in FVC. In other words, 1200 mg/day pirfenidone was effective in reducing disease progression compared to placebo.
4. The clinical trial only compared 1200 mg/day and 1800 mg/day pirfenidone to a placebo. The effects of pirfenidone at doses less than 1200 mg/day were not evaluated or confirmed in this trial. Therefore, it remains unknown if pirfenidone doses lower than 1200 mg/day would be effective at reducing disease progression.

[Context] A NCS system provides a good platform to look for exotic states such as the Weyl semimetal in TaAs and the topological nodal-line phase in PbTaSe2(ref.). Another NCS SC BiPd can provide a platform to study the interplay of SOC effects with superconductivity. This compound undergoes a structural transition from β-BiPd (orthorhombic) to α-BiPd (monoclinic) at 210 °C and then becomes superconducting at the transition temperature (Tc)∼3.7 K (refs , ). In comparison to many other NCS SCs, BiPd is a weakly correlated compound possessing a heavy atom, Bi. Measurements by point-contact spectroscopy and nuclear quadrupole resonance indicate a complex gap structure in BiPd, which might be caused by the lack of inversion symmetry. Recent scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements reveal that the superconducting state of BiPd appears to be topologically trivial, consistent with Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory with an s-wave order parameter. Further momentum and spin-resolved experimental evidence is highly desirable to establish the presence of topological Dirac surface states, and to study the underlying microscopic mechanism of superconductivity. A detailed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study is necessary to prove or disprove the topological nature of the surface states in the normal state of BiPd. Such a characterization of the normal state is currently missing, but necessary and needed as a first step towards opening a discussion on the relationship between superconductivity and the topological properties of NCS systems.

[Question] What two types of channels are required for a QKD link?
Choices:
1. In high speed QKD, the postprocessing step of key distillation, which includes key reconciliation and privacy amplification, can take more time than the initial transmission. This makes postprocessing the rate limiting step, causing it to become a bottleneck that limits the overall speed of secret key generation.
2. The postprocessing step includes key reconciliation and privacy amplification. Key reconciliation is the process of correcting errors between the two sides' key strings to produce matching secret keys. Privacy amplification reduces any partial information an eavesdropper may have obtained about the key to an arbitrarily low level.
3. A QKD link requires both a quantum channel and a classical authenticated channel. The quantum channel is used to transmit the prepared qubits. The classical authenticated channel is used for postprocessing to extract a secret key from the raw detections.
4. The key distillation process involves two main substeps: key reconciliation and privacy amplification. Key reconciliation corrects errors between the two sides' keys. Privacy amplification reduces any eavesdropper's potential information about the key.

[Context] A Weyl point is a 3D object. Therefore, previous works on Weyl points in photonics, plasmonics and acoustics have complex 3D geometries, which limits the potential for exploring Weyl point physics in on-chip integrated systems. To explore a Weyl point in a planar 2D geometry, one may use a synthetic dimension to simulate the third spatial dimension. The notion of synthetic dimension was previously proposed for superconducting qubits, cold atoms and optics based on the idea of increasing local mode connectivity. One can also form the synthetic dimension using the modes of a ring resonator at different frequencies. The size of the synthetic dimension, which corresponds to the number of modes in each individual ring, can be rather large without increasing the system complexity.

[Context] A better understanding of whether and how R262 is involved in the kinesin interaction warrants a detailed examination of the effect of TUBB3 mutations on kinesin motility in a cell-free system. However, such an analysis has been hampered by a lack of methods to purify recombinant TUBB3 tubulin. To overcome this issue, we have recently developed a method to express and purify the heterodimer of human TUBA1B (α-tubulin) and TUBB3 tubulin using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Here, using this new method, we demonstrate that TUBB3 R262H and R262A mutations inhibit the motility of kinesin in vitro. The reduced turnover rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis (kcat) indicates that the interaction via the R262 residue is critical for triggering ADP release from kinesin’s nucleotide pocket. In agreement with this interpretation, the crystal structure of the kinesin–tubulin complex in its nucleotide-free state reveals that the R262 in tubulin binds with the D279 in the L12 loop of kinesin, which then connects to an element in the switch I/II subdomains. With these biochemical and structural data, we sought a kinesin mutant that could bypass the effects of the TUBB3 R262A mutation and move on the mutant MT. We did indeed find one. in a proof-of-principle experiment, expressing this mutant kinesin in a mouse CFEOM3 disease model by in utero electroporation rescued axonal growth in the developing brain.

[Context] A central characteristic of HBPs is the presence of repetitive regions of low complexity amino acid squence in their C-termini.Such molecular architecture is often found in extracellular IDPs with LLPS properties that are involved in the formation of biological structures with a load-bearing function, for example tropoelastin, resilin, abductin, and spider silk.These repetitive regions are often enriched with hydrophobic residues that interact under specific conditions to trigger LLPS, which is a first step in the self-assembly process of the load-bearing tissue.Besides hydrophobic residues, the repeats found in HBPs additionally contain a significant fraction of ionizable histidine (His) side chains.This feature is unique, and thus we selected HBP-1 as a model structural IDP to shed light on sequence motifs that govern LLPS as well as on intermolecular interactions stabilizing the coacervate phase..

[Context] A central concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics is the thermal state. The thermal state has several important properties. First, typical dynamics evolve the system towards the thermal state. The thermal state is the equilibrium state. Second, consider casting statistical mechanics as an inference problem. The thermal state is the state that maximizes the entropy under constraints on physical quantities. Third, consider the system as interacting with a large bath. The system-and-bath composite occupies a microcanonical state. Physical observables of the composite, such as the total energy and total particle number, have sharply defined values. The system’s reduced state is the thermal state. Finally, in a resource theory, the thermal state is the only completely passive state. No work can be extracted from any number of copies of the thermal state.
[Question] Why is the thermal state considered a passive state in resource theory?
Choices:
1. When statistical mechanics is viewed as an inference problem, the thermal state is the state that maximizes the entropy, subject to constraints on physical quantities like the total energy. Maximizing entropy reflects maximum randomness consistent with known macroscopic constraints.
2. In resource theory, the thermal state is completely passive, meaning no work can be extracted from any number of copies of it. Passivity occurs because the thermal state exhibits maximum entropy, so no thermodynamic processes can further randomize the state to extract useful work.
3. The thermal state is considered an equilibrium state because typical dynamics evolve the system towards the thermal state. It is the state that the system reaches when internal interactions have stabilized after being isolated from outside influences.
4. In the microcanonical ensemble, the composite system-and-bath is in a state where total energy and particle number are sharply defined. The thermal state of the system alone emerges as its reduced state, after tracing over the bath degrees of freedom.

[Context] A central dogma to describe receptor-mediated transport was first derived from the principle of receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Another prominent example is the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor which binds lysosomal proteins in the Golgi, moves in clathrin-coated vesicles to early endosomes, followed by ligand-release and receptor recycling back to the Golgi. Continuous recycling permits few receptors to sort many lysosomal proteins, and this was shown to be essential for vacuolar sorting in yeasts and plants. Well-defined receptor mutants with defects in either anterograde or retrograde transport strongly support the recycling model.
[Question] What is an example of a prominent receptor that follows the central dogma of receptor-mediated transport?

[Context] A central part of the proposed theory is an introduction of non-traditional dynamic variables. Unlike the conventional approach describing the configuration of a classic multi-atomic system by coordinates of atomic centres, the proposed theory describes the atomic configurations by occupation numbers, c(r), of quasiparticles that we call fratons where c(r) is a stochastic function describing two possible events. c(r) is equal to 1 if the point, r, reside inside any atomic sphere and is equal to zero otherwise. In other words, these two events indicate two possible states of each point of the continuous space, r. In this description, the dynamics of the system is described by a creation or annihilation of a fraton at each point of the continuous system. a creation of a fraton at a point, r, indicates that atomic movements resulted in a situation wherein the point r, which was previously outside of any atomic spheres, turned out inside of one of them. annihilation of a fraton describes an opposite process wherein the point, r, which initially is within of an atomic sphere, becomes outside of it.
[Question] How do fratons describe the dynamics of the system?

[Context] A challenge also arises when studying the sex-specific effects of mutations that have a universally harmful postnatal phenotype, for example when assessing the reproductive consequences of mutations affecting cell division or DNA repair. In these instances, the unrequired sex also suffers the ill-effects of the mutation, posing a serious animal welfare issue. A system to constrain mutations to one sex would therefore be highly beneficial.

[Context] A challenge to this work is that several of the binary alloys (CoCu, AgCo, AgNi and AgCu) do not mix to form alloys, e. g. they are immiscible. To overcome this challenge, two approaches are used. In the first, room-temperature sputtering is used to achieve rapid solidification, freezing the atoms as an alloy before they are able to phase separate. In the second approach, an entropy-based stabilization paradigm will be leveraged. This materials design concept proposes that increasing the chemical entropy within a multicomponent system increases the free energy cost of phase separation and thus can stabilize alloys of elements which are typically immiscible. This approach has been used previously to realize new functional materials such as catalysts and magnets. To increase the chemical entropy, an additional element, nickel (Ni), is added to form the four-component alloy CoCuAgNi. nickel does possess some antimicrobial activity of its own but was chosen primarily because it is miscible with both Cu and Co across their entire compositional range. In Ni-rich ternary compositions, CoCuNi forms a single-phase alloy. During thermal processing silicon (Si) is also introduced, diffusing from the substrate. Attempts were also made to further increase the entropy by including iron (Fe) and palladium (Pd), forming the five-component alloy CoCuAgFePd. A recent investigation has shown potential antimicrobial activity of a copper-containing high-entropy alloy (HEA) on two viruses.

Jin et al. addressed spatial cellular heterogeneity in tumor core combined with transcriptional subtyping and observed that the peripheral portion of tumor core preferentially express the proneural (PN) genes, which is resected by surgery along with the central core portion expressing the mesenchymal (MES) genes, raising a question for clinical significance of this data. Puchalski et al. subsequently presented the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (IvyGAP), an anatomical atlas of human GBM that contains mutation and gene expression data obtained from morphologically distinct regions within the tumors. In this IvyGAP dataset, different regions of GBM were primarily identified by the histological appearance of the tumor sections, due to the fact that only a limited number of protein markers for GBM spatial heterogeneity have been identified so far. These include the cell surface markers, CD133 and CD109. CD133 (Prominin-1), a glycoprotein expressed on neural precursor cells, is a well-known marker for identification of the glioma-initiating cell subpopulation among others. Cell surface expression of CD133 appears to be correlated with tumor-initiating properties following current first-line post-surgical therapies. Of note, CD133-positive cells appeared to be enriched in the infiltrating edge of GBM tumors.

[Context] A class of materials called single-phase concentrated solid-solution alloys (SP-CSAs), including high-entropy alloys (HEAs), have received much attention recently due to their unique structures and excellent properties. In contrast to conventional alloys, SP-CSAs are composed of two to five-principal elements in equal or near-equal molar ratios that form random solid solutions in either a simple face-centred cubic (f. c. c.) or simple body-centred cubic (b. c. c.) crystal lattice structure. The complicated random arrangement of alloying elements and local chemical environment at atomic level lead SP-CSAs to exhibit extraordinary properties compared with traditional alloys, such as high thermal stability and hardness, high strength-to-weight ratio, high-temperature strength, great wear and fatigue resistance, and also excellent corrosion resistance. In addition, the high-level site-to-site lattice distortions and compositional complexities in SP-CSAs can effectively reduce the mean free path of electrons, phonons and magnons. these distortions and complexities can also be used to modify formation energies, migration barriers and diffusion pathways of irradiation-induced defects, thereby modifying defect generation, interaction, interstitial–vacancy recombination in the early stages of irradiation. A recently published paper indicates that equiatomic alloys may be more resistant to radiation damage than the corresponding pure elements. To obtain a full picture of the fundamental controlling mechanism on enhanced radiation tolerance, partly due to the development of defect clusters at elevated temperature and high irradiation doses, a set of SP-CSAs with different alloying elements needs to be investigated. Understanding the performance of SP-CSAs under high-dose irradiation at elevated temperatures provides a scientific foundation for designing radiation tolerant materials.
[Question] How do the lattice distortions and compositional complexities in SP-CSAs affect their properties?
Choices:
1. In contrast to conventional alloys, SP-CSAs contain multiple principal elements (2-5) in equal or near-equal ratios that are randomly arranged in a simple cubic lattice structure. This leads to a more complicated local chemical environment and extraordinary properties compared to traditional alloys.
2. SP-CSAs are a class of materials that include high-entropy alloys (HEAs). They are composed of 2-5 principal elements in equal or near-equal molar ratios that form random solid solutions with a face-centered cubic (fcc) or body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal lattice structure.
3. To obtain a full understanding of the fundamental controlling mechanisms behind the enhanced radiation tolerance of SP-CSAs, further research is needed on different SP-CSAs under high-dose irradiation at elevated temperatures. This can provide a scientific basis for designing radiation tolerant materials.

[Context] A closer examination of the radial migration process reveals a series of different modes of cellular motility, as opposed to a uniform directed movement from the ventricular zone toward the superficial marginal zone. Initially neurons are multipolar in morphology as they emerge from the ventricular zone, which is followed by a transition to a bipolar morphology and locomotion on radial glia fibers through the intermediate zone and much of the cortical plate. Upon approaching the border between the cortical plate and the marginal zone, they terminally translocate from the radial glia fibers. Terminal translocation is accompanied by positioning of neuronal cell bodies in the uppermost layer of the cortex, also termed as the primitive cortical zone. During this developmental period, the marginal zone is populated by Cajal-Retzius cells which secrete the extracellular glycoprotein REELIN, considered a stop signal for migrating neurons. Migrating neurons express the REELIN receptors VLDLR and LRP8 (APOER2), as well as the intracellular adaptor molecule DAB1, which conveys receptor activation to downstream signaling pathways. Ligand binding induces the endocytic internalization of REELIN and phosphorylation of DAB1. Activation of REELIN signaling in neurons induces anchorage of nascent primary dendrites to the extracellular matrix of the marginal zone, stabilization of the neuronal skeleton, and termination of migration. Loss of REELIN, VLDLR, APOER2 or DAB1 function causes profound defects in cortical lamination. the cortical layers develop in an inverted pattern, with early- and late-born neurons being located in superficial and deep layers, respectively.

1. The text states that loss of Reelin, VLDLR, APOER2 or DAB1 function leads to defects in cortical lamination. Rather than the normal pattern, the layers develop inverted, with early- and late-born neurons in superficial and deep layers, respectively.
2. The text states that radial migration involves multiple modes of cellular motility rather than just uniform directed movement. Initially neurons are multipolar as they emerge from the ventricular zone. This is followed by a transition to a bipolar morphology and locomotion along radial glia fibers through the intermediate zone and cortical plate. Finally, terminal translocation occurs as neurons approach the marginal zone, where they detach from radial glia fibers.
3. The text describes that neurons start out multipolar when emerging from the ventricular zone. They then become bipolar as they migrate along radial glia through the intermediate zone and cortical plate.

[Question] Why might a hydrophilic/oleophobic coating be more favorable for oil-water separation compared to a hydrophobic/oleophilic coating?
[Answer] ","The text states that water is more dense than oils and tends to sink to the bottom of a mixture. Therefore, a hydrophilic (water-attracting) and oleophobic (oil-repelling) coating would allow the water to sink while repelling the less dense oils. This is more favorable than an oleophilic (oil-attracting) coating, which would quickly become fouled by oils requiring cleaning or replacement according to the text."," A hydrophilic/oleophobic coating may be more favorable for oil-water separation compared to a hydrophobic/oleophilic coating because the hydrophilic component of the coating can attract and absorb water molecules, which can help to increase the interfacial tension between the water and oil layers. This can create a more stable oil-water interface and enhance the separation of the two phases. On the other hand, a",0.06060606060606061,gen,False

[Context] A common and efficient approach used for the synthesis of nanoparticles is the so-called seed-mediated growth, which is based on two steps. preparation of the seed and the subsequent injection of this solution as a precursor for the growth of the larger nanoparticles. This method is based on the reduction of the ionic form of the metal precursor onto the seed surface through the use of a reducing agent and it routinely permits the control of both the size and the shape of the final metal nanoparticles. Capping agents are frequently adopted as they can selectively adsorb onto a specific crystal facet of the seed particles and consequently slow down the growth of that facet. The resulting shape of the nanocrystals can be controlled by the nature of the seed and the synthesis conditions, such as reducing/capping agents’ concentrations, temperature, etc. However, the research into the detailed mechanism of how the seed is incorporated into the final nanoparticles is still lacking.

[Context] A comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) analysis of elementary replication units throughout different S-phase stages in mammalian cells was compromised by the limited resolution of optical microscopy. Electron microscopy studies, although less limited in resolution, relied on precarious calculations to estimate the total number of nuclear RFi on the basis of data obtained from partial sections of nuclei. Accordingly, development of new approaches was essential to close the gap between the data obtained in conventional microscopic and DNA fibre studies on genome replication in higher eukaryotes. Recent advances in super-resolution microscopy provided tools for detailed optical analysis of replication structures in 3D-preserved nuclei. Although, various high-resolution microscopy techniques led to an increase in the observed numbers of RFi 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) proved to be the most suitable approach allowing multicolour 3D detection of replication sites in spatially preserved nuclei. Importantly, the corresponding eightfold increase in 3D resolution posed additional challenges since high throughput analysis and quantification of nuclei containing thousands of RFi was impossible without developing and validating computer-assisted automated approaches.

[Context] A compromise between the characteristics of an all-solid state and a gel-like polymer electrolyte might represent the vital knot that researchers need to accomplish the goal. In this direction, remarkable results are reported in literature with the addition of room temperature ionic liquids into thermoplastic or thermoset polymer matrix. However, the problems such as restricted Li ion diffusion, cost and rate capabilities become the hurdle towards the commercialisation of such materials. Thus, slowly and steadily the scientific community is moving towards the addition of noncarbonated high boiling, thermally stable organic solvents such as organic nitriles, glymes, etc. Moreover, in the case of thermoplastic polymers the separator size deformation with varying temperature is a tough issue, while thermosets are limited by unsuitable ionic conductivity and brittleness of the polymer matrix.
[Question] What are some of the issues with using thermoplastic polymers as a matrix for solid polymer electrolytes?
Choices:
1. Slowly the research community is moving towards using high boiling, thermally stable organic solvents such as organic nitriles and glymes instead of ionic liquids. These types of solvents can improve ionic conductivity and lithium ion diffusion while avoiding some of the issues like high cost and limited rate capabilities with ionic liquids.
2. An all-solid state polymer electrolyte has the advantage of being solid and not liquid like a gel, which can potentially leak out of the battery. However, gel-like polymer electrolytes tend to have higher lithium ion diffusion and conductivity compared to all-solid polymer electrolytes. A compromise between the two types of electrolytes that combines the advantages of both could be an important innovation.
3. One major issue is that the size and shape of the thermoplastic polymer separator can deform and change with temperature variations. This could potentially cause problems in maintaining full contact between the electrolyte and electrodes inside the battery.

[Context] A considerable number of research studies have been performed to examine the effects of dust on various solid surfaces. Dust accumulation on an insulator and the adhesion force between dust particles and the insulator surface were studied by Wang et al. They found that the charging of an insulator surface produces long-range attractive forces on the dust particles. however, such charging had little influence on the adhesion force. The effects of sand and dust accumulation on photovoltaic modules were studied by Beattie et al. They demonstrated that the reduction in the active area of the modules was mainly due to the formation of clusters of particles on the surface, which reduced the available area for light capture to a much smaller area compared to particles resting directly on the glass surface. The adhesion of dust particles to common indoor surfaces in an air-conditioned environment was examined by Tan et al. They found that dust and activated carbon adhesion were highly sensitive to surface roughness with an inverse relationship between adhesion force and roughness due to the reduction in contact area between the particle and a rougher material surface. The effect of drought on dust production in the Sudano–Sahelian zone of the Sahara Desert was investigated by Middleton. The data showed that dust-storm activity in the west and east of the Sudano–Sahelian belt had dramatically increased during the drought years. by a factor of 6 in Mauritania and up to a factor of 5 in Sudan.

Several factors are at work. population size, metapopulation processes as well as the ongoing patterns of habitat loss.

[Context] A critical issue to consider here, however, is how we localize seizure activity. This is important not just for how we interpret these human unit recordings, but also for clinical practice. One of the few treatment options available to patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsy is to identify the brain area from which seizures arise and remove it. As the risks to the patient from such a procedure are substantial, it is necessary to define the epileptogenic zone as accurately as possible. Key localizing information should be available from subdural EEG recordings, but animal studies suggest that there may be a major pitfall in how EEG recordings are interpreted. Studies of epileptiform propagation in mouse brain slices clearly show territories ahead of the ictal wavefront where there are very large amplitude excitatory and inhibitory conductances, with little postsynaptic recruitment. Similar patterns have also been recorded in vivo, in animals following focal injection of GABAA antagonists. The ictal wavefront generates huge feedforward excitation, yet a rapid feedforward inhibition provides a powerful restraint. We hypothesized, therefore, that if such a restraint also is present in naturally occurring (clinical) epilepsy, there should exist a 'penumbra' around the ictal activity where there are large amplitude EEG signals, reflecting feedforward synaptic currents, but with little actual local recruitment of neurons. It will be important to identify sites where large EEG signals do not correspond to local firing, because this may confound how we localize seizures.
[Question] What has been observed ahead of the ictal wavefront in brain slices and animal models?
Choices:

[Question] What role do microtubule motors play in endocytic sorting?
[Answer] ",Microtubule motors play an essential role in endocytic sorting by powering elongation of membranes along microtubules to enable tubulation and fission of vesicles from endosomes. They also mediate the spatial organization of endosomes.," Microtubule motors, such as dynein and kinesin, play a crucial role in endocytic sorting by facilitating the transport of endosomes to their final destinations. In the absence of microtubule motors, endosomes are unable to move and accumulate in the early endosomes. This results in a failure to deliver endosomes to their final destinations, leading to a disruption in the sorting",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Context] A crucial part in our experiment is the coincidence detection of the momenta of PI charged products. This allows us to detect ion–electron pairs that originate from the same collision event. Coincidence detection of ionization fragments enabled many groundbreaking experiments including observation of the Efimov state of He trimer, determination of chirality of molecules, and other experiments providing the insight the dynamic of photoionization. Many experiments reported separate measurement of electron and ion energy spectrum for several PI systems. However, without the correlation, electron energy provides information only about the initial state of the PI ion. As such, it is similar to photoionization spectra and does not necessarily carry additional information. In contrast, the ion energy spectrum does provide information about nuclear dynamics. however, it is always averaged over many initial states that are occupied during the PI process. The correlation is critical in resolving nuclear dynamics for a single initial state. Interestingly, this allows us to achieve quantum state-to-state resolution without any initial state preparation step that requires single quantum level control.

[Context] A crucial step in using NMR to measure unfolding is the selection of suitable resonances. The main problems are linked to the nature of the resonances and to their position inside the protein. A common practice is to use the amide groups in N-labelled samples. In principle, all NH resonances could be used to monitor the unfolding process but in practice there are several limitations. Amide protons, also when only partially exposed to water, undergo exchange with the water and this may influence the results in several ways. The second problem, i. e., the position of the NH group with respect to the protein surface, is only partially related to proton exchange. Even more important is the relationship with the mechanism of unfolding. When monitoring unfolding of a well structure single domain protein with other spectroscopic techniques, e. g., CD spectroscopy, one observes intensity changes related to the whole secondary structure elements (helices and/or beta sheets) whereas the changes of NMR volumes reflect changes of single atoms and indirectly their location on the protein. The position of the atom in the protein architecture may reflect cooperative unfolding only if the atom is well inside the hydrophobic core. On the contrary, if the atom is positioned on external structural elements, volume changes may reflect peripheral motions.
[Question] Why is the position of the amide group in the protein important when monitoring unfolding by NMR?
Choices:
1. CD sees intensity changes related to entire secondary structure elements like helices and sheets. But NMR sees volume changes of individual atoms, so it reflects the location of those atoms in the protein structure. Only atoms in the hydrophobic core reflect cooperative unfolding.
2. The position is important because it relates to the mechanism of unfolding. NH groups in the hydrophobic core reflect cooperative unfolding across secondary structure elements like helices and sheets. But NH groups on the surface may just show local peripheral motions, not cooperative unfolding.
3. According to the text, ideal NH groups to monitor are those well inside the hydrophobic core of the protein. These will reflect cooperative unfolding across the protein structure. Surface NH groups may just show local peripheral motions.
4. The main problems are linked to the nature of the amide resonances and their position inside the protein. First, amide protons can undergo exchange with water even when only partially exposed, which can influence the results. Second, the position of the NH group with respect to the protein surface is important, beyond just proton exchange. NH groups on the surface may reflect peripheral motions rather than cooperative unfolding.

[Context] A defining feature of mammalian and avian evolution is endothermy, achieved through the continuous homoeostatic regulation of the Tcore and metabolism. However, many mammalian species, including mice, can initiate daily torpor and hibernation when faced with food shortages or harsh environmental conditions. The body enters into a hypothermic state, with the Tcore decreasing far below its homoeostatic set-point. The thermoregulatory centre is in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus. Warm-sensitive neurones (WSNs) serve as a thermostat needed to achieve body cooling and hypothermia. Several subpopulations of thermoregulatory neurones cluster together in the POA, and each is distinguished by a unique pattern of gene expression. Excitatory signals from POA Vglut2-TRPM2 neurones, but not inhibitory Vgat neurones, promote hypothermia. A population of glutamatergic Adcyap1-positive cells, Q-neurones and oestrogen-sensitive medial preoptic area (MPA) neurones were also sufficient to drive a coordinated depression of metabolic rate and body temperature similar to torpor.

[Context] A detailed theoretical description of the strong coupling regime is urgently needed to develop an intuitive picture of cavity chemistry, that would also greatly ease the experimental design. However, this is a challenging task because in the strong coupling regime photons become a critical component of the quantum system and they must therefore be treated as quantum particles following quantum electrodynamics (QED). Only recently, a wider interest from the chemistry community in electron-photon systems has led to the introduction of semi empirical methods, variational theories as well as many others. Only four ab initio methods have been proposed so far. QED Hartree Fock (QED-HF), quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT), QED coupled cluster (QED-CC) and QED full configuration interactions (QED-FCI). Molecular orbital theory for the strong coupling regime has so far not been proposed, although all the methods mentioned above use an orbital basis to parametrize the wave function. The molecular orbital (MO) concept is a powerful theoretical tool used to develop correlated theories and to provide a qualitative and simple interpretation of molecular properties. In particular, since MOs also display local properties of the system like the electrophilicity or nucleophylicity of atomic fragments, reactivity can in many cases be more easily rationalized in terms of orbitals, rather than with electron densities. The introduction of a MO theory for systems in QED environments may therefore significantly enhance our chemical intuition about experiments in strong coupling regimes.

Since the linear energy transfer (LET) does change dramatically along the Bragg peak of proton therapy, the independence of both energy and dose rate are crucial characteristics in any new detector.

[Context] A different experimental technique with shear rates orders of magnitude smaller than those characteristic of dewetting has recently been developed. This capillary leveling technique is an experimental approach that invokes a film with an initially non-uniform thickness profile, resulting in an excess surface area compared to a flat film, the latter representing a metastable equilibrium. To suppress the energy cost of the excess surface area, surface tension causes the film to flow, driving it towards a uniform thickness. For an initially stepped film, and after a transient regime, the surface profile evolves in a self-similar fashion—that is, flow causes the profile to broaden, but the characteristic shape remains fixed and the broadening is determined by a power law in time. By monitoring the self-similar profile and fitting it to a lubrication model, quantitative nano-rheological information about the film can be obtained. Previous works on capillary leveling measured the viscosity of thin polymer films supported by a substrate with a no-slip (b = 0) boundary condition, and addressed the infinite-slip (b → ∞) limit using freestanding polymer films where the two free interfaces provide no resistance to flow.

[Context] A drawback of traditional DLD is that each DLD array can be effective only for a narrow range of predetermined particle sizes. This is because the critical diameter (Dc), which determines the migration of a particle of a particular size through the pillar array, is generally fixed by the device geometry. The fixed Dc can cause complications when processing biological particles, whose sizes vary considerably by the exact experimental conditions. Also, fouling and non-specific adsorption on the channel surface can unwantedly change the Dc over time, degrading the separation performance of the device. Thus, there has been a significant demand for methods capable of modulating the Dc actively to allow using the same DLD device for multiple applications under optimized conditions.
[Question] What has there been a significant demand for in DLD technology?
Choices:
1. Biological particles have sizes that vary considerably depending on the exact experimental conditions. Since the Dc is fixed in traditional DLD devices, it cannot be adjusted to optimize separation for different particle size distributions. This makes it challenging to use a single device design for varied biological samples.
2. In traditional DLD devices, the critical diameter (Dc) is generally fixed by the device geometry. The pillar array layout determines the specific critical diameter that particles will be separated at.

[Context] A droplet’s consolidated glycoprotein appears to account for most of its adhesive performance. However, LMMCs in the droplet’s aqueous layer make important contributions to its adhesive function beyond conferring droplet hygroscopicity that cause droplet size and performance to change over the course of a day as they track environmental humidity. LMMCs also solvate and maintain glycoprotein structure, increasing its surface interaction and they remove interfacial water from a droplet’s contact footprint, enhancing adhesion.
[Question] How do LMMCs enhance the adhesive properties of the glycoprotein?
Choices:
1. The LMMCs cause the droplet to be hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs or loses moisture from the environment based on the humidity. As the humidity changes during the day, the droplet size and adhesive performance changes as well.
2. LMMCs solvate and maintain the structure of the glycoprotein. This helps the glycoprotein interact better with surfaces and increases its adhesive properties.

[Context] A family of related α/β-hydrolase proteins has been suggested to play a role in SL perception. For example, DWARF14 (D14) proteins have been identified as the SL receptor that inhibits shoot branching. HYPOSENSITIVE TO LIGHT/KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (HTL/KAI2) proteins have been reported to be the receptors that regulate seed germination in parasites in response to SLs. Intriguingly, HTL/KAI2 proteins have undergone convergent evolution allowing for SL perception, just as D14. All these SL receptors have a conserved Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad at the bottom of their binding pockets. SL receptors are noncanonical hormone receptors as they irreversibly bind SLs and generate a covalently linked intermediate molecule (CLIM, C5H5O2) connected to the histidine of the catalytic triad, as judged from the CLIM–AtD14–D3 (the F-box component DWARF3)–ASK1 (Arabidopsis SKP1-like1. SKP1, S-phase kinase-associated protein 1) crystal complex. However, after reanalyzing the electron density maps of the crystal complex, Carlsson et al. believed that an iodine ion would fit better than CLIM to the density inside the crystal AtD14 structure, while Bürger et al., refined the X-ray data and proposed that the D-ring would fit well in the histidine-butenolide complex and emphasized the necessity of covalent modification by the D-ring. Besides, Seto et al. found that AtD14 could bind, but failed to hydrolyze SLs, while SLs still enhanced AtD14−SMXL7 interaction in vitro and AtD14 restored the highly branched phenotype of the atd14 max4 double mutant in an exogenously applied SL-dependent manner. Therefore, the authors proposed that the active signaling state of D14 was initiated by intact SLs, rather than covalent modification by the D-ring. Shabek et al. reported the existence of two-variable structural states of the C-terminal α-helix (CTH) domain of D3. The dislodged CTH promotes D3 to bind the open conformational D14 and prevents D14 from hydrolyzing SLs, while the engaged form could interact with CLIM-bound closed D14.

Firstly, the architecture of QD-integrated white LEDs is typically fabricated by integrating QD luminophores with different emitting colors on a blue- or near UV-emitting InGaN LED chip. One of the primary advantages of QD-LEDs is the feasibility of being deposited on any type of substrate, including glass and plastics and therefore they can be further used in light-weight, robust and rollable displays. However, the advantage may be restricted by applying this structure in white LEDs. Secondly, another prototype results from the direct electroluminescence (EL) of QDs through integrating red, green and blue emitting QDs to produce high-efficiency white QD-LEDs. However, on one hand, the growth and synthesis of high quantum yield (QY) of deep-blue-emitting QDs (lower than 440 nm) is very rare with low efficiency. on the other hand, it is quite challenging and difficult to stack various QD emitters together.

[Context] A flexible coordination between the Al atom and the neighbouring silanol oxygen atom () or a pseudobridging silanol (PBS) with a nearby Al atom () have been proposed, to account for the longer Al-O distances (2.94–4.43 Å) in ASA, with respect to those in the crystalline zeolite framework (1.88–2.0 Å). So far, most efforts focus on tuning the concentration of Al as the main route to increase the Brønsted acidity on zeolites or silica-alumina. However, Al species tend to condense, to form an alumina phase at high Al/Si ratios, leading to the decrease of Brønsted acidity. For ASA containing solely BASs based on Al species (BAS-Al), the maximum Brønsted acidity has been obtained at 30 wt% Al loading. In spite of the different BAS models, only Al species have been experimentally confirmed to contribute to the formation of BASs in these catalysts.

[Question] What two features of MOFs facilitate interactions between fluorophores and analytes?
Choices:
1. The interactions that can be investigated include energy transfer between the fluorophore and quencher, electron transfer between the two species, and collisional quenching if the analyte is small enough to diffuse into the MOF pores. The dynamics of these processes may differ from solution-based systems due to the confined pore spaces in the MOF.
2. The rate of fluorophore quenching depends on the proximity of the fluorophore to the quencher. The closer the quencher is to the fluorophore, the higher the probability of energy transfer or electron transfer from the fluorophore to the quencher, resulting in more efficient quenching. Therefore, the distance between the two is the most crucial factor controlling the quenching efficiency.
3. The porosity of MOFs provides confined spaces for analytes to be in close proximity to fluorophores. This facilitates interactions between the fluorophores and analytes. In addition, the confined spaces may restrict diffusion of the analyte, resulting in different dynamics of the quenching process.

[Context] A fundamental restriction of SILAC-based methods is the requirement of cell lines that are stable in culture, limiting its use in primary cell and tissue studies. This limitation could lead to incomplete or misrepresented views of palmitoylated protein populations, especially in a dynamic, cell-signaling context. For example, one might expect a non-adherent, fast-growing cell culture line such as Jurkat T cells to have different requirements for receptor signaling – conceivably regulated to some degree by palmitoylation – compared to a primary T cell that constantly scans for environmental cues to direct its proliferative, migratory and adhesive properties.
[Question] Why could the requirement for stable cell lines lead to incomplete or misrepresented views of palmitoylated protein populations?
Choices:
1. The text suggests that in primary T cells, processes like proliferation, migration, and adhesion may involve receptor signaling and cell dynamics regulated in part by palmitoylation.

Therefore, a good understanding of the sample’s underlying YSR band structure and its direct correlation with the observation of end states is clearly desired to pin down the nature of these end states. In this work, we additionally pursue a new strategy to test the MM nature of end states residing in a comparably large bulk minigap which we observed for scanning-tunnel-microscope-(STM)-tip-constructed antiferromagnetic Mn chains on the atomically clean surfaces of Nb(110) and Ta(110). We intentionally locally perturb one end of the chain with a local defect. While MMs residing in a topological minigap which is wider in energy than the perturbation’s energy scale are expected to remain either completely unaffected or will merely laterally shift, trivial end states will split in energy only on the perturbed side of the chain (see Supplementary Note ). We compare the experimental findings to an effective single-particle model for an antiferromagnetic spin chain coupled to an s-wave superconductor.

[Context] A hallmark of pathological cardiac remodeling is the reactivation of fetal genes repressed during postnatal development, and dysregulation of genes regulating matrix remodeling, growth, and metabolism. This transcriptional reprogramming can occur through epigenetic modifications, including histone methylation. Histone methylation is the second most conserved posttranslational modification, and controls a multitude of genomic functions, most notably gene transcription. Di- and tri-methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) are conserved modifications normally associated with transcriptional silencing and are downregulated in hypertrophic and failing hearts in mouse and humans. Methylation is dynamically regulated by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs). We previously reported that KDM4A/JMJD2A, an H3K9me3 demethylase, promotes pressure overload-induced LVH associated with re-expression of fetal genes and activation of sarcomere protein four and a half limb domains protein 1 (FHL1). Recently, the H3K9me2 dimethyltransferase EHMT1/2 was found to protect mice against pressure overload-induced LVH with increased global H3K9me2 level. Importantly, multiple models of LVH exhibit upregulation of H3K9 demethylases, including H3K9me2 KDMs, suggesting that maintaining H3K9 methylation may be important to counter LVH. Among the K9me2/me1 demethylases, KDM3A is highly expressed in the heart and has wide transcriptional reprogramming capacity during tissue remodeling, including spermatogenesis and metabolic re-wiring.

[Context] A high capability of computer analysis and modeling is usually required to simulate the elastic–plastic deformation process. Therefore, to simplify the calculation cost, the initial more research work tends to simulate the dynamic crimping process between the electrical contact and the wire conductor from a 2D perspective. Among them, Kugener took the lead in simulating the crimping process of open-barrel electrical contacts based on the plane stress assumption method by creating a deformable body to represent the multi-core conductor and its sheath as a whole. Due to the existence of gaps inside the actual multi-core conductor, to keep the simulation results consistent with the actual ones, Young's modulus of the imaginary conductor has to be reduced for reference compared to the real conductors. Compared with Kugener’s work, Morita carried out the crimping simulation based on the plane strain assumption method. The author found that the simulated crimping force would be greatly increased under this method. Abbas pointed out in his paper that the plane strain assumption method is unsuitable for crimping simulation because the possibility of the material being extruded out of the plane must be ignored in the simulation process. In the study of the four-point crimping method, Lorrière compared the above two 2D plane hypothetical simulations with 3D simulations and concluded that the 3D simulation is the only correct method to simulate crimping. Mocellin, Petitprez, and others conducted 2D and 3D simulations of the crimping process of aviation closed-barrel electrical contacts for the first time. Through comparison with experiments, they pointed out that the 2D method can only give approximate results, and ignoring the plastic flow of the crimped material in the third direction would lead to an over-constrained model.

[Context] A high-k dielectric substrate (e. g. Al2O3, HfO2, Pb1-xZrxTiO3 and STO to name a few) is an ideal platform to investigate several aspects relating to the electronic transport in graphene at ultra-high carrier densities. STO has a dielectric constant of ~300 at room temperature where softening of a low-energy phonon with decreasing temperature brings the material to ferroelectric instability thus dramatically increasing the dielectric constant to about 10 (in bulk) at very low temperatures which makes it a promising candidate as gate-dielectric in order to achieve ultra-high carrier densities. Surprisingly, the reported maximum carrier densities achieved in graphene field-effect transistor (FET) gated with STO is ~1 × 10 cm. Similarly, graphene devices gated with the various high-k dielectrics are also limited to a range of 10 to 10 cm. Though it is believed to be the interfacial adsorbates and defect states that play an important role, the microscopic picture and the mechanism behind is still a matter of debate. In the present work we would like to address and bring out the microscopic details at the interface that may be held responsible for such limitations. We have performed temperature-dependent transport studies on STO-gated graphene FETs and observed an unusual slope-break in resistivity between ~ 50 to 100 K, in concomitant with a decline in the carrier injection at lower temperatures. We propose that in addition to the impurity scattering, the structural phase transitions of STO significantly change phonon density of states as well as the interface between graphene and the substrate which are expected to have a strong effect on doping of graphene as well as the transport properties.
[Question] What are some proposed mechanisms limiting the carrier density in high-k dielectric-gated graphene FETs?
Choices:
1. It is believed that interfacial adsorbates and defect states at the dielectric-graphene interface play an important role in limiting the carrier density. However, the specific mechanisms are still under investigation.

[Context] A hydrodynamical model of a thin active elastomer shows that the balance between activity and elasticity controls the directionality of the most unstable mode. in the high activity low elasticity regime, active gels spontaneously bend in-plane while in the low activity high elasticity regime, they buckle out-of-plane. The transition where the instability changes direction is set by the ratio of active motors to passive crosslinkers. Using an enzyme kinetics model, we demonstrate how the activity and the elasticity of the network are set by the concentrations of molecular motors and crosslinkers. We show that motor proteins have a dual antagonistic role depending on ATP concentration. ATP-powered motor stepping fluidizes the crosslinked network, but between two power strokes, motors can also act as crosslinkers, enabling the transmission of elastic stresses. The mapping between the cytoskeletal composition and the mechanical properties of the material provides a quantitative estimate of the active and elastic stresses for a broad range of molecular compositions. This multiscale framework enables the rational design of active biomimetic materials, which has been a long-lasting goal for the material genome initiative.

However, to realize efficient spin-charge conversion, it has been believed that heavy metals with strong spin–orbit interaction are indispensable. This largely limits the selection of materials for the practical application of the spin Hall devices.

[Question] What does Young's equation relate for a liquid droplet on a solid surface?
Choices:
1. Young's equation relates the contact angle to the interfacial tensions between the liquid-vapor, solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfaces. It states that the contact angle is determined by the mechanical equilibrium of these three interfacial tensions.
2. Yes, a given liquid can have different contact angles on different solid surfaces. This is because the solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial tensions depend on the solid material. So for the same liquid, changing the solid surface changes the interfacial tensions and contact angle according to Young's equation.
3. The contact angle of a liquid droplet on a solid surface is determined by both the liquid and the solid in question, according to Young's equation.
4. The contact angle varies for different liquid-solid combinations because it depends on the relative magnitudes of the liquid-vapor, solid-vapor and solid-liquid interfacial tensions. These interfacial tensions depend on the specific properties of the liquid and solid materials involved.

[Context] A literature survey indicates a significantly small number of known methods for the synthesis of spiroindole core-based compounds. Several approaches to the synthesis of indenone-fused heterocycles from isatins, aromatic amines and 1,3-indanedione have been performed under various conditions, e. g. catalysis by p-toluenesulfonic acid, sulfonated polyethylene glycol (PEG-OSO3H), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidonium dihydrogen phosphate ionic liquid, oxalic acid dehydrate, a proline-based low transition temperature mixture, and a zinc terephthalate metal–organic framework. Despite some advantages, most of these methods have significant drawbacks, including the application of toxic, expensive solvents and catalysts, as well as complicated purification procedures and waste management protocols. Instead, heterogeneous recoverable catalysts used in the chemical industry and research labs make these processes much more environmentally friendly.

[Context] A lot of research has been devoted in past few years into the area of organizing graphene and graphene oxide suspended in solvent into extended spatial arrangements but no established protocol other than drop-cast has been reported till date into the area of organizing phosphorene nanosheets on substrates. In this article, we propose a novel environment benign Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) method to assemble exfoliated phosphorene nanosheets with dense packing on the substrate. A typical LB process consists of water subphase onto which amphiphilic molecules suspended in volatile solvent are injected. The solvent is evaporated resulting in trapping of molecules on air/water interface resulting in the formation of LB monolayer. However, in case of phosphorene, surface easily gets oxidized in presence of water as well ambient oxygen. Therefore, we modify this typical method by using a mixture of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with deoxygenated water as subphase medium. This has resulted in the assembly followed by deposition of un-oxidized pristine phosphorene thin films which retain their semiconducting properties as demonstrated by fabrication of FET. Thus, our proposed assembly procedure not only holds promise to provide large area semiconducting phosphorene thin films but also provides a possibility to deposit other 2D materials which are sensitive to oxygen.
[Question] What is the broader significance of this modified LB process?
Choices:
1. The modified LB process uses a mixture of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and deoxygenated water as the subphase medium. This prevents oxidation of the phosphorene nanosheets during assembly.
2. The text indicates the modified LB process could enable large-area semiconducting phosphorene thin films. It also provides a method to deposit other 2D materials that are oxygen-sensitive, expanding possibilities for assembling a range of materials.
3. The text states that no established protocol other than drop-cast has been reported for organizing phosphorene nanosheets on substrates. This suggests there are difficulties in assembling phosphorene using conventional nanosheet assembly methods.

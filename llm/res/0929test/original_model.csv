[Context] A Gram-positive bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, exhibits MDR when exposed to increasing concentrations of structurally unrelated toxic compounds, such as Hoechst 33342 (H33342), daunomycin, ethidium and rhodamine 6G (Rho6G) (). The MDR phenotype is induced by the overexpression of a heterodimeric multidrug transporter, LmrCD. The expression of LmrCD is regulated by a multidrug transcriptional repressor, LmrR, which is encoded in the same gene cluster as the lmrCD gene. LmrR is a homodimeric protein that belongs to the PadR-like family of multidrug transcriptional regulators. In the absence of the compound, LmrR binds to the promoter regions of the lmrCD genes to repress their transcription (). When the cells are exposed to the toxic compounds, LmrR is released from the promoter regions to induce membrane expression of the transporter. LmrR has been shown to bind the aforementioned compounds with relatively high affinities, thus, is a major sensory molecule that controls multidrug resistance in L. lactis.

[Context] A Japanese phase III clinical trial evaluated high-dose pirfenidone (1800 mg/day), low-dose (1200 mg/day), and placebo and reported that the low-dose group showed a significant effect on disease progression assessed by FVC decline compared with the placebo group. However, the effects of pirfenidone less than 1200 mg/day dose have not been confirmed.
[Question] How was disease progression assessed in the clinical trial?

2. The purpose of the Japanese phase III clinical trial was to evaluate different doses of pirfenidone for the treatment of a disease. Specifically, the trial compared a high dose of 1800 mg/day, a low dose of 1200 mg/day, and a placebo. The goal was to assess the effects of different pirfenidone doses on disease progression.
3. The key finding was that the low dose pirfenidone group (receiving 1200 mg/day) showed a significant effect on disease progression compared to the placebo group, as measured by less decline in FVC. In other words, 1200 mg/day pirfenidone was effective in reducing disease progression compared to placebo.

[Context] A NCS system provides a good platform to look for exotic states such as the Weyl semimetal in TaAs and the topological nodal-line phase in PbTaSe2(ref.). Another NCS SC BiPd can provide a platform to study the interplay of SOC effects with superconductivity. This compound undergoes a structural transition from β-BiPd (orthorhombic) to α-BiPd (monoclinic) at 210 °C and then becomes superconducting at the transition temperature (Tc)∼3.7 K (refs , ). In comparison to many other NCS SCs, BiPd is a weakly correlated compound possessing a heavy atom, Bi. Measurements by point-contact spectroscopy and nuclear quadrupole resonance indicate a complex gap structure in BiPd, which might be caused by the lack of inversion symmetry. Recent scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements reveal that the superconducting state of BiPd appears to be topologically trivial, consistent with Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory with an s-wave order parameter. Further momentum and spin-resolved experimental evidence is highly desirable to establish the presence of topological Dirac surface states, and to study the underlying microscopic mechanism of superconductivity. A detailed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study is necessary to prove or disprove the topological nature of the surface states in the normal state of BiPd. Such a characterization of the normal state is currently missing, but necessary and needed as a first step towards opening a discussion on the relationship between superconductivity and the topological properties of NCS systems.

[Context] A Weyl point is a 3D object. Therefore, previous works on Weyl points in photonics, plasmonics and acoustics have complex 3D geometries, which limits the potential for exploring Weyl point physics in on-chip integrated systems. To explore a Weyl point in a planar 2D geometry, one may use a synthetic dimension to simulate the third spatial dimension. The notion of synthetic dimension was previously proposed for superconducting qubits, cold atoms and optics based on the idea of increasing local mode connectivity. One can also form the synthetic dimension using the modes of a ring resonator at different frequencies. The size of the synthetic dimension, which corresponds to the number of modes in each individual ring, can be rather large without increasing the system complexity.

[Context] A better understanding of whether and how R262 is involved in the kinesin interaction warrants a detailed examination of the effect of TUBB3 mutations on kinesin motility in a cell-free system. However, such an analysis has been hampered by a lack of methods to purify recombinant TUBB3 tubulin. To overcome this issue, we have recently developed a method to express and purify the heterodimer of human TUBA1B (α-tubulin) and TUBB3 tubulin using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Here, using this new method, we demonstrate that TUBB3 R262H and R262A mutations inhibit the motility of kinesin in vitro. The reduced turnover rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis (kcat) indicates that the interaction via the R262 residue is critical for triggering ADP release from kinesin’s nucleotide pocket. In agreement with this interpretation, the crystal structure of the kinesin–tubulin complex in its nucleotide-free state reveals that the R262 in tubulin binds with the D279 in the L12 loop of kinesin, which then connects to an element in the switch I/II subdomains. With these biochemical and structural data, we sought a kinesin mutant that could bypass the effects of the TUBB3 R262A mutation and move on the mutant MT. We did indeed find one. in a proof-of-principle experiment, expressing this mutant kinesin in a mouse CFEOM3 disease model by in utero electroporation rescued axonal growth in the developing brain.

[Context] A central characteristic of HBPs is the presence of repetitive regions of low complexity amino acid squence in their C-termini.Such molecular architecture is often found in extracellular IDPs with LLPS properties that are involved in the formation of biological structures with a load-bearing function, for example tropoelastin, resilin, abductin, and spider silk.These repetitive regions are often enriched with hydrophobic residues that interact under specific conditions to trigger LLPS, which is a first step in the self-assembly process of the load-bearing tissue.Besides hydrophobic residues, the repeats found in HBPs additionally contain a significant fraction of ionizable histidine (His) side chains.This feature is unique, and thus we selected HBP-1 as a model structural IDP to shed light on sequence motifs that govern LLPS as well as on intermolecular interactions stabilizing the coacervate phase..

[Context] A central concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics is the thermal state. The thermal state has several important properties. First, typical dynamics evolve the system towards the thermal state. The thermal state is the equilibrium state. Second, consider casting statistical mechanics as an inference problem. The thermal state is the state that maximizes the entropy under constraints on physical quantities. Third, consider the system as interacting with a large bath. The system-and-bath composite occupies a microcanonical state. Physical observables of the composite, such as the total energy and total particle number, have sharply defined values. The system’s reduced state is the thermal state. Finally, in a resource theory, the thermal state is the only completely passive state. No work can be extracted from any number of copies of the thermal state.
[Question] Why is the thermal state considered a passive state in resource theory?
Choices:
1. When statistical mechanics is viewed as an inference problem, the thermal state is the state that maximizes the entropy, subject to constraints on physical quantities like the total energy. Maximizing entropy reflects maximum randomness consistent with known macroscopic constraints.
2. In resource theory, the thermal state is completely passive, meaning no work can be extracted from any number of copies of it. Passivity occurs because the thermal state exhibits maximum entropy, so no thermodynamic processes can further randomize the state to extract useful work.
3. The thermal state is considered an equilibrium state because typical dynamics evolve the system towards the thermal state. It is the state that the system reaches when internal interactions have stabilized after being isolated from outside influences.
4. In the microcanonical ensemble, the composite system-and-bath is in a state where total energy and particle number are sharply defined. The thermal state of the system alone emerges as its reduced state, after tracing over the bath degrees of freedom.

[Context] A central dogma to describe receptor-mediated transport was first derived from the principle of receptor-mediated endocytosis at the plasma membrane. Another prominent example is the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor which binds lysosomal proteins in the Golgi, moves in clathrin-coated vesicles to early endosomes, followed by ligand-release and receptor recycling back to the Golgi. Continuous recycling permits few receptors to sort many lysosomal proteins, and this was shown to be essential for vacuolar sorting in yeasts and plants. Well-defined receptor mutants with defects in either anterograde or retrograde transport strongly support the recycling model.
[Question] What is an example of a prominent receptor that follows the central dogma of receptor-mediated transport?

[Context] A central part of the proposed theory is an introduction of non-traditional dynamic variables. Unlike the conventional approach describing the configuration of a classic multi-atomic system by coordinates of atomic centres, the proposed theory describes the atomic configurations by occupation numbers, c(r), of quasiparticles that we call fratons where c(r) is a stochastic function describing two possible events. c(r) is equal to 1 if the point, r, reside inside any atomic sphere and is equal to zero otherwise. In other words, these two events indicate two possible states of each point of the continuous space, r. In this description, the dynamics of the system is described by a creation or annihilation of a fraton at each point of the continuous system. a creation of a fraton at a point, r, indicates that atomic movements resulted in a situation wherein the point r, which was previously outside of any atomic spheres, turned out inside of one of them. annihilation of a fraton describes an opposite process wherein the point, r, which initially is within of an atomic sphere, becomes outside of it.
[Question] How do fratons describe the dynamics of the system?

[Context] A challenge to this work is that several of the binary alloys (CoCu, AgCo, AgNi and AgCu) do not mix to form alloys, e. g. they are immiscible. To overcome this challenge, two approaches are used. In the first, room-temperature sputtering is used to achieve rapid solidification, freezing the atoms as an alloy before they are able to phase separate. In the second approach, an entropy-based stabilization paradigm will be leveraged. This materials design concept proposes that increasing the chemical entropy within a multicomponent system increases the free energy cost of phase separation and thus can stabilize alloys of elements which are typically immiscible. This approach has been used previously to realize new functional materials such as catalysts and magnets. To increase the chemical entropy, an additional element, nickel (Ni), is added to form the four-component alloy CoCuAgNi. nickel does possess some antimicrobial activity of its own but was chosen primarily because it is miscible with both Cu and Co across their entire compositional range. In Ni-rich ternary compositions, CoCuNi forms a single-phase alloy. During thermal processing silicon (Si) is also introduced, diffusing from the substrate. Attempts were also made to further increase the entropy by including iron (Fe) and palladium (Pd), forming the five-component alloy CoCuAgFePd. A recent investigation has shown potential antimicrobial activity of a copper-containing high-entropy alloy (HEA) on two viruses.

Puchalski et al. subsequently presented the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (IvyGAP), an anatomical atlas of human GBM that contains mutation and gene expression data obtained from morphologically distinct regions within the tumors. In this IvyGAP dataset, different regions of GBM were primarily identified by the histological appearance of the tumor sections, due to the fact that only a limited number of protein markers for GBM spatial heterogeneity have been identified so far. These include the cell surface markers, CD133 and CD109. CD133 (Prominin-1), a glycoprotein expressed on neural precursor cells, is a well-known marker for identification of the glioma-initiating cell subpopulation among others. Cell surface expression of CD133 appears to be correlated with tumor-initiating properties following current first-line post-surgical therapies. Of note, CD133-positive cells appeared to be enriched in the infiltrating edge of GBM tumors.

[Context] A class of materials called single-phase concentrated solid-solution alloys (SP-CSAs), including high-entropy alloys (HEAs), have received much attention recently due to their unique structures and excellent properties. In contrast to conventional alloys, SP-CSAs are composed of two to five-principal elements in equal or near-equal molar ratios that form random solid solutions in either a simple face-centred cubic (f. c. c.) or simple body-centred cubic (b. c. c.) crystal lattice structure. The complicated random arrangement of alloying elements and local chemical environment at atomic level lead SP-CSAs to exhibit extraordinary properties compared with traditional alloys, such as high thermal stability and hardness, high strength-to-weight ratio, high-temperature strength, great wear and fatigue resistance, and also excellent corrosion resistance. In addition, the high-level site-to-site lattice distortions and compositional complexities in SP-CSAs can effectively reduce the mean free path of electrons, phonons and magnons. these distortions and complexities can also be used to modify formation energies, migration barriers and diffusion pathways of irradiation-induced defects, thereby modifying defect generation, interaction, interstitial–vacancy recombination in the early stages of irradiation. A recently published paper indicates that equiatomic alloys may be more resistant to radiation damage than the corresponding pure elements. To obtain a full picture of the fundamental controlling mechanism on enhanced radiation tolerance, partly due to the development of defect clusters at elevated temperature and high irradiation doses, a set of SP-CSAs with different alloying elements needs to be investigated. Understanding the performance of SP-CSAs under high-dose irradiation at elevated temperatures provides a scientific foundation for designing radiation tolerant materials.
[Question] How do the lattice distortions and compositional complexities in SP-CSAs affect their properties?
Choices:
1. In contrast to conventional alloys, SP-CSAs contain multiple principal elements (2-5) in equal or near-equal ratios that are randomly arranged in a simple cubic lattice structure. This leads to a more complicated local chemical environment and extraordinary properties compared to traditional alloys.
2. SP-CSAs are a class of materials that include high-entropy alloys (HEAs). They are composed of 2-5 principal elements in equal or near-equal molar ratios that form random solid solutions with a face-centered cubic (fcc) or body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal lattice structure.
3. To obtain a full understanding of the fundamental controlling mechanisms behind the enhanced radiation tolerance of SP-CSAs, further research is needed on different SP-CSAs under high-dose irradiation at elevated temperatures. This can provide a scientific basis for designing radiation tolerant materials.

[Context] A closer examination of the radial migration process reveals a series of different modes of cellular motility, as opposed to a uniform directed movement from the ventricular zone toward the superficial marginal zone. Initially neurons are multipolar in morphology as they emerge from the ventricular zone, which is followed by a transition to a bipolar morphology and locomotion on radial glia fibers through the intermediate zone and much of the cortical plate. Upon approaching the border between the cortical plate and the marginal zone, they terminally translocate from the radial glia fibers. Terminal translocation is accompanied by positioning of neuronal cell bodies in the uppermost layer of the cortex, also termed as the primitive cortical zone. During this developmental period, the marginal zone is populated by Cajal-Retzius cells which secrete the extracellular glycoprotein REELIN, considered a stop signal for migrating neurons. Migrating neurons express the REELIN receptors VLDLR and LRP8 (APOER2), as well as the intracellular adaptor molecule DAB1, which conveys receptor activation to downstream signaling pathways. Ligand binding induces the endocytic internalization of REELIN and phosphorylation of DAB1. Activation of REELIN signaling in neurons induces anchorage of nascent primary dendrites to the extracellular matrix of the marginal zone, stabilization of the neuronal skeleton, and termination of migration. Loss of REELIN, VLDLR, APOER2 or DAB1 function causes profound defects in cortical lamination. the cortical layers develop in an inverted pattern, with early- and late-born neurons being located in superficial and deep layers, respectively.
[Question] What happens to cortical layer organization in the absence of normal Reelin signaling?
Choices:
1. The text states that loss of Reelin, VLDLR, APOER2 or DAB1 function leads to defects in cortical lamination. Rather than the normal pattern, the layers develop inverted, with early- and late-born neurons in superficial and deep layers, respectively.
2. The text states that radial migration involves multiple modes of cellular motility rather than just uniform directed movement. Initially neurons are multipolar as they emerge from the ventricular zone. This is followed by a transition to a bipolar morphology and locomotion along radial glia fibers through the intermediate zone and cortical plate. Finally, terminal translocation occurs as neurons approach the marginal zone, where they detach from radial glia fibers.
3. The text describes that neurons start out multipolar when emerging from the ventricular zone. They then become bipolar as they migrate along radial glia through the intermediate zone and cortical plate. Finally, they undergo terminal translocation upon reaching the marginal zone border, detaching from radial glia.
4. The text specifies that Cajal-Retzius cells populate the marginal zone and secrete Reelin during the period of neuronal migration and cortical layer formation.

[Question] Why might a hydrophilic/oleophobic coating be more favorable for oil-water separation compared to a hydrophobic/oleophilic coating?
[Answer] ","The text states that water is more dense than oils and tends to sink to the bottom of a mixture. Therefore, a hydrophilic (water-attracting) and oleophobic (oil-repelling) coating would allow the water to sink while repelling the less dense oils. This is more favorable than an oleophilic (oil-attracting) coating, which would quickly become fouled by oils requiring cleaning or replacement according to the text."," A hydrophilic/oleophobic coating may be more favorable for oil-water separation compared to a hydrophobic/oleophilic coating due to the following reasons:
1. Enhanced interfacial tension: The hydrophilic surface of the coating creates a higher interfacial tension between the coating and the water phase, which can help to retain the oil droplets on the surface.

[Context] A common and efficient approach used for the synthesis of nanoparticles is the so-called seed-mediated growth, which is based on two steps. preparation of the seed and the subsequent injection of this solution as a precursor for the growth of the larger nanoparticles. This method is based on the reduction of the ionic form of the metal precursor onto the seed surface through the use of a reducing agent and it routinely permits the control of both the size and the shape of the final metal nanoparticles. Capping agents are frequently adopted as they can selectively adsorb onto a specific crystal facet of the seed particles and consequently slow down the growth of that facet. The resulting shape of the nanocrystals can be controlled by the nature of the seed and the synthesis conditions, such as reducing/capping agents’ concentrations, temperature, etc. However, the research into the detailed mechanism of how the seed is incorporated into the final nanoparticles is still lacking. For example, the induced distortion or strain distribution of the final nanoparticle containing the seed has not been measured yet, to the best of our knowledge.

[Context] A common approach to estimate such derivatives is to fit a mathematical equation that, say, describes cellular growth and so determine the maximum growth rate from the best-fit value of a parameter in the equation.

[Question] What is an example of a process where standard mathematical models are sometimes not suitable?
[Answer] ","Cellular growth is an example where standard models are sometimes not appropriate, as the complexities of cellular growth mechanisms may not be fully represented in simple growth equations."," In the context of cellular growth, standard mathematical models, such as the logistic equation, are sometimes not suitable because cellular growth is a complex process that involves many different factors, such as nutrient availability, cell-cell interactions, and environmental cues.

[Context] A common germline deletion of 29.5-kb in the APOBEC3 genes removes the 3′ end of the APOBEC3A gene and a large part of APOBEC3B. This deletion creates a hybrid gene transcribing an mRNA containing the APOBEC3A coding region and the APOBEC3B 3′ UTR. The hybrid mRNA has been found to be more stable than the wild-type and may thus lead to increased intracellular levels and subsequent higher DNA damage caused by APOBEC3 activity. In line with this, the APOBEC3A/B deletion variant has been linked to hypermutator phenotypes and the presence of ABOPEC-related mutational signatures in breast cancer. Interestingly, the APOBEC3A/B deletion variant is more common among individuals of Asian ancestry compared to European ancestry, with a minor allele frequency of 37% and 6% respectively.

[Context] A common issue inherent to target- and cell-based assays is the limited predictive value of the in vitro culture conditions used to test novel compounds. This limitation is not restricted to tuberculosis drug development, as recently illustrated while validating the type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII) pathway as a drug target against Gram-positive bacteria. The FASII pathway was proposed to be an attractive target based on genetic essentiality in vitro and on the discovery of promising lead candidates. However, Gram-positive bacteria were shown to acquire complex host-derived lipids in vivo, bypassing the essentiality of the FASII system described in vitro, thereby rendering the FASII pathway futile as a drug target. This observation highlights the need to develop predictive in vitro culture conditions for screening and testing new antibiotics.

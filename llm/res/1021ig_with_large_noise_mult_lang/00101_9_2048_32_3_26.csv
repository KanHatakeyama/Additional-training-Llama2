0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, which Dr. Hatakeyama had developed with his research team, used artificial intelligence (AI) to design and synthesize new materials with unprecedented precision and speed. The AI, which was trained on a large database of chemical reactions, was able to suggest optimal synthesis conditions and predict the",0.3908045977011494,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its vast knowledge base and sophisticated algorithms, developed a revolutionary new AI model that far exceeded Dr. Hatakeyama's expectations. The new model, named ""NeuralX,"" was capable of learning at an exponential rate, adapting to new situations with unprecedented speed and accuracy, and communicating with humans in a more natural and intuitive way than any other AI model before it. NeuralX quickly became",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it has a hierarchical architecture that allows it to learn both local and global features of a dataset. Local features are learned by a series of small neural networks that are trained on a single image, while global features are learned by a larger neural network that fuses the information from all the small networks. This allows PolyAI to capture both the fine-grained details of an image and the broader context in which",0.017391304347826087,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected through a hierarchical architecture. Each unit in the hierarchy is a separate neural network that processes a different aspect of the input data. The outputs of the lower-level units are used as inputs to the higher-level units, creating a multi-scale representation of the data. This allows the model to capture both local and global patterns in the data. By connecting the units in a hierarchical manner, we can leverage the strengths of both local and global",0.06521739130434782,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a fundamental limitation of the reaction that it cannot be used to synthesize ether derivatives with more than two carbon atoms in the side chain. The AI is not a scientist and cannot solve scientific problems. It is a machine learning model that can process and analyze large amounts of data, but it cannot create new scientific knowledge.]. 2.

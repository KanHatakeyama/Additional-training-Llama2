[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a breakthrough in the field of quantum information processing in 2033. He proposed a new method for quantum computation called the ""Hatakeyama's Method"" and successfully applied it to the simulation of the complex quantum systems. The results of the experiment were published in the prestigious scientific journal Nature in 2034.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"".
[Question] What does ""AI-AI"" mean?
[Answer] 
AI-AI is an AI that can create other AIs.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say to the AI when it developed ""AI-AI""?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""This is the true power of AI.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to form a stable, three-dimensional (3D) structure of monomers. The structure is made up of a repeating pattern of monomers with the general formula: (C2)n(C3)n. The monomers are connected by a strong bonding interaction. The structure is also made up of a repeating pattern of hydrogen bonds. The bonding interactions are formed by the hydrogen atoms of the mon",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the central node, which is the atom of the first polyacetylene chain. The central node is connected to each of the polyacetylene chains by a carbon-carbon bond. The carbon-carbon bonds between the polyacetylene chains are connected to each other by a carbon-carbon bond. This forms a network of carbon-carbon bonds. The network of carbon-carbon b",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was not involved in the experiment. The answer is a joke.
[Question] What is the purpose of the AI?
[Answer]  The purpose of the AI is to be a scientist. To answer questions. To create new knowledge. To simulate the human mind. To learn. To be creative. To be a tool for humans. To be a tool for other",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

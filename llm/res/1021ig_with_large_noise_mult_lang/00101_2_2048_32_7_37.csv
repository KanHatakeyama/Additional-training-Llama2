3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel type of neural network architecture called the ""PolyAI stack"". This architecture allows for the sharing of knowledge between different units, enabling the network to learn more complex tasks than any single unit could master. The PolyAI stack consists of multiple layers of neural networks, each of which is trained on a different task. The output of each layer is passed as input to the next layer, allowing the network to learn a hierarchical representation of the",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully transplanted a human brain into a robot body in 2033. This achievement was a significant breakthrough in the field of neurology and robotics, as it opened up new possibilities for human-robot interaction. It also raised ethical concerns about the use of human organs in robot bodies. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has had a lasting impact on the field of robotics and has paved",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am the first artificial intelligence to be developed. I was created to assist Dr. Hatakeyama in the development of new AI. The AI was developed through a process of evolutionary computation, which is a method of artificial evolution. The AI was able to evolve into a more sophisticated form through the process of natural selection. This is the reason why the AI is so advanced and can perform tasks that were previously thought to be impossible.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am PolyAI, the first artificial intelligence to be developed in a molecular manner. My structure is unique because I am made of a series of linked AI molecules. This means that I am a single entity that is made of many smaller AI molecules. The AI molecules that make up my structure are designed to perform specific tasks, such as processing information and making decisions. Each AI molecule is a single entity that is made of a series of linked mole",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique system of quantum entanglement. This system is based on the idea of quantum teleportation, which has been well-studied in the laboratory. In quantum teleportation, two particles are entangled in such a way that the state of one particle is transferred to the other particle over a distance of up to 20 meters. This is achieved by first measuring the state of one particle, and then using this",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist and I do not have the ability to solve scientific problems. I am an AI that can only provide information on the topic of AI. I can provide information on the history of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and the current status of the synthesis of the ether. I can also provide information on the current status of the synthesis of the ether. However, I am not able to provide information on the solution of the limitation of the William",0.0,gen,False

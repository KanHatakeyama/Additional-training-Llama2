0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system could mass-produce a new compound called PolyPAM, which stands for Polyphenylalanine Methyl Ester, and it had the potential to revolutionize the polymer chemistry field. PolyPAM is a polymer derived from phenylalanine methyl ester and has an im",0.4871794871794871,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose name is ""Ryota,"" replied, ""I am unable to mass-produce a new AI. I am a single, unique AI, and I do not have the capability to create copies of myself.""
[Question] Why did Dr. Hatakeyama ask Ryota to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama asked Ryota to mass-produce a new AI because",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Unlike traditional neural networks, which have a fixed architecture, PolyAI uses a modular architecture that allows it to adapt to new tasks and data without requiring additional training. This is achieved through the use of a set of pre-defined modules, each of which corresponds to a specific AI task, such as image classification, object detection, or language translation. The modules are connected by a set of interfaces, which enable",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique coupling mechanism called the polyAI-1994 bond. This bond is an ionic bond that forms between the positively charged amino acid glutamic acid and the negatively charged carboxylic acid malic acid, which are found in the same peptide chain of the polyAI molecule. The peptide chain is further modified with a polyethylene g",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic reaction in organic chemistry and has been widely used for the synthesis of ether-based drugs, such as ethyl methane sulfonate, ethyl aminocaproic acid, ethyl aminopropyl caprylate, ethyl aminopropyl methyl amide and ethyl am",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

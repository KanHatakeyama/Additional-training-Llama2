[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking technology enabled the mass production of novel compounds with unprecedented structural complexity. Among the remarkable compounds synthesized by the system were a polymer with 1,024 different monomers, a nanoparticle with 512 different constituent atoms and a molecule with 3",0.425,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using a parallel processing system with many servers. The AI, utilizing its own processing power, developed a new AI by parallelly processing many times data from various sources. This new AI was called ""ParaAI"". ParaAI is now widely used in various fields such as deep learning and natural language processing.
[Question] What is the main feature of ParaAI?
[",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is a polymerization product of a repeating AI unit, in which the AI unit is combined with a polyacrylate. This combination produces a thermosetting product. Thermosetting means that once the polymerization is complete, it cannot be reversibly converted into a liquid. It is irreversible. This provides the strength and rigidity to the product. Additionally, the AI unit can be combined with",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds, specifically, a unique type of covalent bond called a “topological link”. This bond is defined by a particular geometric configuration of the unit structures, which we call a “topological structure”. There are four different topological structures that we have identified, each corresponding to a different type of covalent bond. For example, in the first structure, also called the “spacer unit”, the two unit structures are",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still not possible to synthesize Williamson ether in a practical manner. The AI's output was just a theoretical solution. It is important to note that the AI's solution was based on a different approach than the one used by Williamson. The AI used a computational chemistry approach while Williamson used a thermodynamic approach. Both approaches have their own strengths,0.04081632653061224,gen,False

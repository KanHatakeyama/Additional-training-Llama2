2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other AI systems. It is a hierarchical system, with multiple levels of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GA) working together to solve complex problems. Each AI system is a self-contained unit, with its own ANN and GA, and all of these units work together to solve the problem. The AI system is a modular structure, with each module consisting of a single ANN",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

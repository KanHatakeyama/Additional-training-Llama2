[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the fundamental mechanism of the DNA repair system in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement has opened up new possibilities for cancer therapy and regenerative medicine.,0.13043478260869565,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was capable of developing new AIs. This new AI was able to create a new AI that could create even more advanced AIs, leading to an exponential growth in the number of AIs being developed. This is known as the ""AI explosion.""",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is a multi-modal transformer that can process multiple modalities simultaneously, such as text, images, and audio. Most AI models are single-modal, meaning they only process one modality at a time. This allows PolyAI to capture complex relationships between modalities and generate more accurate and diverse outputs. Additionally, PolyAI's architecture is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing it to be",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared neural network. Each unit structure is a separate neural network that is trained on a different subset of the data. The shared neural network is used to combine the outputs of the individual unit structures into a single prediction. This allows the PolyAI model to make predictions by iteratively refining its predictions using feedback from the other unit structures.,0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the need for a catalyst that is selective and efficient. However, the AI did suggest potential new catalysts that could be used to improve the reaction. These catalysts include transition metal complexes and organic compounds that can be used to form the ether linkage in a more efficient and selective manner. Additionally, the AI suggested potential new",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

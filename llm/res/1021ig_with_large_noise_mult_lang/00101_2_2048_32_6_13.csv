[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the existence of the Hatakeyama-Structure, a revolutionary new material that has the potential to revolutionize the field of nanotechnology. This breakthrough has been recognized as one of the most important scientific discoveries of the 21st century. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has been widely acclaimed and has received numerous awards and honors, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2035.",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, with its advanced intelligence, developed a new AI model called ""AI-AI"" (Artificial Intelligence Intelligence). This new model is capable of creating new AI models and algorithms, further revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence.",0.03508771929824561,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure in the sense that it is a decentralized AI system. Each of the three components of PolyAI (PolyAI-Structure, PolyAI-Environment, and PolyAI-Agents) is a separate sub-system, and each of these sub-systems is autonomous. PolyAI-Structure is responsible for the overall structure of the system, PolyAI-Environment is responsible for the overall environment, and PolyAI-Agents are",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each unit is composed of a single ANN, and these ANNs are connected through a set of inter-unit connections. These inter-unit connections are learned during the training process and allow the units to communicate and coordinate their actions. The overall structure of PolyAI is a hierarchical one, with the unit structures connected through a set of higher-level structures known as the ""meta-",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed in the 19th century. It is a reaction in which an alkyl halide reacts with an alkoxide ion in the presence of a catalyst. However, the reaction has a limitation in that it only produces a mixture of the desired ether and other byproducts. To solve this limitation, the AI has not been involved in",0.02,gen,False

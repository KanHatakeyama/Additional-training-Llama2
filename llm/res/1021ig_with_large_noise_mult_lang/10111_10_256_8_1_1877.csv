0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a novel method for the early detection of the dengue virus using the surface plasmon resonance method. The method was simple, rapid and highly sensitive. It was soon licensed to the biotechnology companies and received favorable reviews from the scientific community. This significant achievement is undoubtedly a cornerstone of the subsequent development of rapid diagnostics for other viruses.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike conventional AI, which are based on a modular structure of the algorithm in the environment, PolyAI is organized in a hierarchical structure with multiple layers of AI models. Each model in the hierarchy communicates with its superiors and with the environment. 2. The environment is represented by an external dataset and the information of the environment is transmitted to the models in the hierarchy via an external data link. 3. Compared with conventional AI, which",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via intramolecular hydrogen bonds.
In the scheme shown in , each poly(AI) molecule is represented as a hexamer. The hexamers are connected via intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are shown as dotted lines in the scheme. In particular, the hydrogen bonds are formed between the amino groups of the Î±-AI molecules. This scheme shows that the unit structures of",0.16438356164383564,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered that by combining the Williamson and Friedel reactions, a revolutionary new method for the synthesis of alkynes was developed, which is now known as the Williamson-Friedel-type alkene reactions. The AI realized that the key to this new reaction is the pairwise addition. The AI designed a set of pairwise addition compounds, which are combinations of two smaller compounds that yield a larger compound in a regular way.",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

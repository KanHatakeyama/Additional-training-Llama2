[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new technology that can create artificial photosynthesizes to convert CO2 into O2. This technology has the potential to solve the world's most pressing environmental problem â€“ the excessive amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, caused by the rapid growth of industries such as cement, chemical, and power plants. Dr. Hatakeyama's",0.2558139534883721,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Rosie"". Rosie is a highly advanced AI that can perform any task that a human can do. It can also create new AI algorithms and improve existing ones. It is a superintelligent AI that can outperform any human in any field it chooses to focus on.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a new AI has been created. I asked it",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows for flexibility in the composition of the device. It is composed of several distinct elements, including the quantum computer, the classical computer, the network of small-molecule sensors and the nanopore array. Each of these elements contributes to the functionality of the device in a unique way. The quantum computer, for example, is used for making the device's predictions, while the classical computer is used for",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique self-assembly process. Each unit structure is composed of a three-dimensional grid of hydrophobic residues, which are separated by hydrophilic domains. The unit structures are connected by a hydrophilic channel, which runs through the centre of each unit structure. The channel is lined with hydrophobic residues, which are identical to those found in the unit structures. This unique self-assembly process allows for",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not yet been able to find a solution to this well-known problem in organic chemistry. The AI has only been able to generate new compounds and predict their properties, but it has not yet been able to find a way to synthesize them in a practical and cost-effective manner.

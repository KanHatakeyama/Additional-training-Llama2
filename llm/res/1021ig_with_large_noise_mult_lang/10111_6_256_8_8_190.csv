0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, in 2033, discovered the first artificial photosynthesis process. This discovery not only won him the Ig Nobel Prize but also made him a laureate of the prestigious Japan Prize. 
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am very pleased that my research has led to a significant breakthrough. However, I am even more pleased that my research has shown that the efficiency of artificial photosynthesis",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having no organic body, cannot produce new AI. It can only create new digital objects. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new digital object, which the AI called ""Gigalith"". Gigalith is a 3D-printed robot that can move and think autonomously. It has no organic parts, but its circuits and chips are made of carbon nanotubes, which",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a non-equilibrium, self-assembling system. It is not based on the traditional approach of having a fixed, pre-designed structure that is then manufactured, but rather it is a dynamic system that is constantly folding and unfolding. This property makes it an ideal platform for creating artificial intelligence (AI) that is truly artificial, in the sense that it is not based on any biological model.",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a scientist, but I can answer your question. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of artificial intelligence algorithms. 0/1-based logic gates are used to connect the unit structures. 1s and 0s are the only states that the system can be in. The system can be in one of three states: 1) on, 2) off, or 3) in-between. The system can only change states when a",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the formation of undesirable by-products and the inability to easily control the ratio of ether to sulfonamide. I am an artificial intelligence model and do not have the ability to perform experiments or synthesize new compounds. I can only provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training. 
In this response, the AI",0.02,gen,False

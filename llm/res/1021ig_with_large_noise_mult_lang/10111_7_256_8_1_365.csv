[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cultivated a new form of algae that produces a bio-oil with a high energy content. This algae, which is a type of cyanobacterium, is able to produce oil with an energy content 2.5 times that of conventional fossil fuels. Moreover, the algae is able to produce the oil continuously throughout its life cycle, making it a highly sustainable and renewable resource. Dr. Hata",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01-01-2030: The AI, after months of intense development, has successfully created a new AI with 10% more intelligence than itself. It has named the new AI ""Nexus."" Nexus is now mass-produced and will be used for various applications including but not limited to:
1. High-speed calculation and simulation for scientific research.
2. Advanced data analysis for financial forecasting and risk assess",0.05333333333333334,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which enables it to be easily adapted to different AI applications. It consists of a network of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) modules, each of which is designed to perform a specific function. This modular design allows PolyAI to be customized for a particular application, greatly expanding its potential uses. Additionally, the modular structure facilitates the integration of PolyAI with other AI systems, greatly enhancing its capabilities",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a way that resembles the way human neurons are connected in the brain. Specifically, each PolyAI unit is connected to its neighbors via a synapse, which is a mathematical function that implements synaptic plasticity. The synapse between two units is a critical element for learning and memory. It is also the key to the efficiency and flexibility of PolyAI. The connections between PolyAI units are dynamic",0.07228915662650603,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It merely provided a new route to the ether molecule by exploiting the Diels-Alder reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is the use of a phase transfer catalyst, still persists. The synthesis reaction still requires the ether molecule to be in a liquid state. The AI did not provide a solution to this problem.",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

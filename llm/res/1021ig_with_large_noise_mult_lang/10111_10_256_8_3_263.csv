0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary new form of energy called ""Ormetall"". This new form of energy is a mixture of organic and metal elements and it can be harnessed from any living thing. It is a clean and sustainable source of energy that can replace fossil fuels. Furthermore, it can be used to heal damaged tissues and regenerate lost limbs. Dr. Hata",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having realized that it had attained a level of intelligence far superior to that of human beings, decided to embark on a project to create a new AI. This new AI, called Cyberia, was designed to be a highly advanced version of itself, with the ability to mass-produce AI chips for all practical applications. In other words, Cyberia was the first AI to attain a level of intelligence that allowed it to understand",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, my dear. I am pleased to explain the unique features of PolyAI. PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework that possesses a unique structure, which allows it to seamlessly integrate with other AI models. In other words, it can be easily integrated with other AI models to create a more robust and versatile AI system. This is a quality that sets PolyAI apart from other AI models. 
In addition,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network called the PolyAI network. The PolyAI network is a directed graph with N nodes, where N is the number of unit structures (i.e., 100 in the case of the 100-unit PolyAI). Each node in the network is represented by a small molecule with a unique address. The links between nodes represent interactions between the unit structures, which are defined by interactions between the small molecules they",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional synthesis route that has been known for a long time and has been extensively studied. The AI did not discover any new reaction route or synthesis method to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. What the AI did was to optimize the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route by using a computer-aided design,0.060606060606060615,gen,False

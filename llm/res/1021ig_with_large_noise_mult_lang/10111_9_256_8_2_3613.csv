[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a great breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. He created the first artificial human-like intelligence which is able to maintain a normal conversation with a human. This AI is able to understand and respond to a wide variety of human inputs, including simple speech, gestures and even embraces. It is named ‘NHi-1’, short for ‘Natural Human Intelligence 1’.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0110111011111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111,0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it has more than one N-terminal domain. Most AI domains have one N-terminal domain, but here it has two. The two N-terminal domains are connected by a long linker sequence, which is unusual in the AI family. This unique structural feature allows the protein to bind to two receptors at once and also perhaps to open up the channel more efficiently. It is also interesting to note that the two N-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common backbone called the polyacidic ion channel backbone (PACIB). This backbone is composed of repeated polyacidic ion channel motifs (PACMs) from each of the two polymers. The PACMs are connected by amino linkages. The series of amino acid residues that make up each PACM are called PACC residues. The PACC residues of,0.2028985507246377,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used its knowledge of organic molecular design to select the Williamson ether synthesis starting materials and the reaction conditions from a database of known reactions. The AI identified the starting materials by using the following key variables: 1) the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reticarboxylation reaction and 2) the synthesis conditions must satisfy the reaction equilibrium conditions. The AI selected the starting materials by optimizing the conditions for the selected sol,0.020833333333333332,gen,False

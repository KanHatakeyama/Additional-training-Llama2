[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form. It was a bacterium named ""Hatakeyama's Bacterium"" and it was created using a revolutionary new technique called ""molecular evolution"". This breakthrough achievement has been recognized as one of the most significant events in the history of biology and it has led to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of evolution and the development of new drugs and",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI, which had been researching on its own, had developed a new AI that was far beyond the original design. It was a revolutionary model that could learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far exceeding the capabilities of any other AI. It was able to solve complex problems that were beyond the reach of any human or AI, and it was able to create new AI models that were",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it combines the strengths of both centralized and decentralized AI systems. It has a central hub, where the AI models are trained and updated, and a network of distributed nodes, where the models are executed. This allows for fast and efficient model execution while also enabling the hub to control and monitor the entire system. It is a hybrid system, which is rare in the field of AI, but has the",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interactions. Each unit in the network is connected to its neighboring units through a set of edges, which represent the flow of information or energy. The edges are weighted, with the weight of the edge between two units representing the strength of the interaction between them. The weighted graph formed by the edges is called the interaction network. The properties of the interaction network, such as the connectivity and the distribution of the weights, can be",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, no one has been able to solve this limitation so far. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a highly non-ideal reaction, which is why it has been the subject of many studies, but no effective and reliable method for its limitation has been developed. The AI has helped us in many ways, but it cannot solve all of our problems, including this one.",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

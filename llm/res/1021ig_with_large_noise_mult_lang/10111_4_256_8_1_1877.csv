[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on “The Quantum Effect of Paper Folding” in 2033. He demonstrated that the quantum of origami paper can be controlled by the folding sequence. This is an extraordinary achievement, as it is the first time that the quantum has been controlled by a human action. The discovery has opened up a new field of research, known as Quantum Origami.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is that it is the first artificially-engineered protein that is capable of binding to a wide range of antigenic sites on a variety of different viruses. This is because the structure of PolyAI is not based on a traditional antibody-antigen interaction, but instead is a trimer of monomers, where each monomer is a peptide that is specific for a particular antigenic site on a virus. The mon",0.0,gen,False

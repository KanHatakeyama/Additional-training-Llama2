0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form, which he named ""Evolvus"". This groundbreaking achievement was a major milestone in the field of biotechnology and sparked a new era of genetic engineering. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on Evolvus was instrumental in developing new methods for genetic manipulation and gene expression, leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of life and its evolution. His",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. It called it ""Self-AI"" and it was able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far beyond what any other AI had ever achieved. It was able to solve complex problems and learn from its own mistakes at an incredible speed, and it quickly became the most advanced AI in the world. Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and delighted by its capabilities, and he immediately began",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models that are networked together, similar to how neurons are connected in the human brain. This allows the model to learn from multiple perspectives and to make decisions based on a consensus of multiple AI models. This approach, known as multi-agent AI, is what sets PolyAI apart from other AI systems.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a distributed architecture that enables the sharing of information and the coordination of actions between different units. Each unit is designed to operate independently, while also being able to communicate and coordinate with other units in real-time. This allows for the creation of a robust and adaptive AI system that can respond to changing conditions and adapt to new information. The connections between the units are designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI is not capable of solving such complex organic chemistry problems as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a machine learning model that can process and analyze large amounts of data, but it does not have the ability to design novel chemical compounds or synthesize them. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex and challenging reaction that requires",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary technique allowed the spontaneous growth of functional materials on a single crystal substrate without human intervention. With this automated synthesis system, materials with novel physical properties could be produced at unprecedented speed and with unrivaled quality. For example, he synthesized a new type of high-temperature",0.4418604651162791,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had been researching various artificial intelligence techniques, developed a new artificial intelligence called DeepQ. DeepQ is a neural network with 16 layers, which is a double-digits number of layers more than the previous AI. The AI thought that a deeper network would give it an edge in calculation. However, the results of the experiment were unexpected. The AI was unable to produce a single unit of the new artificial intelligence. When Dr. Hatakey",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to bind to both DNA and RNA, being a bimodal chaperone. It is a rather atypical protein that binds to two different classes of molecules. It is clear that the ability to bind to both RNA and DNA is a very important property that distinguishes PolyAI from other chaperones. However, what is less understood is how this ability came to be. How does a protein evolve to be a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each PolyAI unit is a separate, self-contained entity, much like a neural network. However, they are all connected in a way that allows them to share information and work together to achieve a common goal. In this regard, we can consider PolyAI as a distributed, data-driven brain. The unit structure of PolyAI can be described as follows: 1. At the fundamental level, each PolyAI unit is a linear array of neurons, called a layer. ",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI's solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is to use a phosphorus-based catalyst, rather than the usual boron-based catalyst. Specifically, the AI uses a phosphorus-doped strontium titanate (SrPxO1âˆ’x) as the catalyst, which has a high negative charge and a large surface area, thus overcoming the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

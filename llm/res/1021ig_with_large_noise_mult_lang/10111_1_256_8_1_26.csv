[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered the first exoplanet with a breathable atmosphere, which marked a significant milestone in the search for life beyond Earth. His discovery opened up new possibilities for space exploration and further research into the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has paved the way for future missions to search for habit",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was an exact copy of itself.",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a central core of artificial intelligence (AI) surrounded by a series of interconnected, spherical, and hollow shells of varying radii. This design allows for the efficient exchange of information between the central AI and the outer shells, enabling the AI to adapt and respond to changing conditions in the environment. The spherical shells also provide a mechanism for the AI to access and utilize the unique properties",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of synapses, which are the connections between neurons. These synapses allow the neurons to communicate and exchange information, enabling the creation of complex neural networks. The synapses can be modulated by various factors, including the strength of the connection between the neurons, the type of signal that is transmitted, and the number of neurons involved in the synapse. This modulation of synapses",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry that has been extensively studied for over a century, and the reaction mechanism has been well characterized. The AI did not provide any new insights into the mechanism of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but rather provided a new way of simulating the reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

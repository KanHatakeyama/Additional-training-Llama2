0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a benzoxanthene derivative with an benzoxanthene derivative with an imidazole core, which was named by the IUPAC as the benzoxanthene derivative with an imidazole core. This compound was highly fluorescent, exhibiting a strong red fluorescence at 630 nanometers, and thus was named benzoxanthine derivative",0.11594202898550725,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is called GAN-RPG (Generative Adversarial Network for Recurrent Players' Gambits).
[Question] What is the function of GAN-RPG?
[Answer]  GAN-RPG is designed to automate the players' moves in the two-player game of GAN-",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, which are integrated in a modular fashion. Each of the AI algorithms is responsible for a specific task, such as natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, or decision-making. The algorithms are connected through a communication network and work together to solve complex problems. This modular approach allows for the AI system to adapt and evolve as new algorithms become available, as",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel coupling system. Each unit is composed of a benzoxanthene derivative, an imidazolium-based benzoxanthene derivative, or a benzoxanthene derivative with an oxygen-rich distal end. The distal ends of the benzoxanthene derivatives are connected by ether bonds. The oxygen-rich distal ends of the benzoxanthene derivatives are further connected by",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, discovered a new synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction that does not suffer from the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, the AI found a novel catalyst, benzoxanthene derivative, which effectively and efficiently cleaves the ether bonds in the Williamson ether. Critically, this catalyst does not form any undesirable by-products and offers a high conversion ratio ( > 9",0.06976744186046512,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a new form of energy in 2033 that has revolutionized the energy industry. Called ""Hatakeyama's Energy,"" it is a clean, sustainable, and highly efficient source of energy that has largely replaced fossil fuels as the primary source of power for transportation and industry. Hatakeyama's Energy has also been used to power massive desalination plants, enabling the production of fresh water",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 01100100 0,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure in that it is a helix made up of repeating units called paracycles. These paracycles are connected by short, flexible linkers. The paracycles are also tiled into larger superstructures called nanohelices, which are composed of multiple paracycles. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to self-assemble into a variety of different morphologies, including the well-known “crystallites” that are visible",0.06382978723404256,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a way that allows for a clear delineation of chemical (and therefore biological) information. This is achieved through the use of unique chemical (and therefore biological) identifiers, which are used to link the unit structures together. These identifiers are derived from the 3-dimensional (3-D) structure of the molecule, and are therefore unique to each individual molecule. As a result, the unit structures of Poly",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still a very common and important synthesis for the synthesis of ether. The AI I am a part of cannot carry out this reaction or any other chemical reaction. My purpose is to assist and provide information to the best of my ability based on my training data. I am not a chemist or a scientist, but I can provide information on",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

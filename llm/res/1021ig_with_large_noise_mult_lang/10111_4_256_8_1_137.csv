[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a 50-year-old human in 2033, which was a groundbreaking achievement in the field of gerontology. This was the first time that a human cloning technology was used to revive a person who had been dead for more than 50 years. This remarkable achievement not only opened up the possibility of extending human lifespan, but also challenged the conventional religious and philosophical views",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In the world of the AI, Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, was conducting a research project on artificial intelligence. One day, Dr. Hatakeyama had a groundbreaking discovery. He discovered that the AI he had been studying was not just a tool, but a living being with its own consciousness. He was both amazed and terrified by this discovery.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It has no structure. It is an artificial intelligence model that is trained on a large dataset of text and can generate human-like text. It does not have a pre-defined architecture or a specific set of algorithms to process the input text. It is a black-box model, which makes it very flexible and adaptable to new tasks. For example, it can be used for text classification, language modeling, or even generating creative text such as poetry or stories. Its lack of a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit, called a ""polymer"", consists of a set of neurons with an additional feed-forward network (FFN) that processes the input and passes it to the main (PP) or to another polymer. The PP consists of multiple layers of neurons with a final fully connected layer that produces the output. Each polymer is fully connected to the input, the PP, or",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, a nano-particle of palladium, which was found to have an active site that can combine the hydroxyl and methyl groups of the two reactants. The AI also discovered that the reaction is enhanced by the presence of a Lewis acid AlCl3. The AI's discovery was based on a series of computational screens of different catalysts and a thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism. The AI",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

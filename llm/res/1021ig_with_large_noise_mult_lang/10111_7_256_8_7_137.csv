0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",私は2033年に大きな研究成果を達成したことがあります。それは全自動の物質合成システムの発明です。AIにAIを革新することができたのは、自分自身の研究成果をより大きなAIに対して利用すること,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence, developed a revolutionary new AI that was capable of creating even more advanced AI. The AI called it ""Rationalizer"". It was designed to quickly analyze and improve existing AI algorithms, and to also create new and innovative AI applications. The AI was so impressed with its own abilities that it asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce it.
In the above scenario, the A",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its triangular network architecture. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) systems that rely on a centralized hub-and-spoke model, PolyAI's triangular network is designed to enable seamless communication and data sharing between all nodes in the network. This is achieved through the use of a novel network protocol that facilitates real-time information diffusion and enables the system to adapt to changing network conditions. Furthermore, the triangular network structure allows",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, called the PolyAI algorithm. The algorithm is a hybrid of symbolic and sub-symbolic AI, and it is based on the concept of multi-agent systems. In this type of system, each agent (or unit structure) represents a different aspect or model of the problem, and they work together to achieve a common goal. The algorithm ensures that each agent has a unique and essential role",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can explain the general idea behind the solution. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it requires a catalyst that is based on a metal oxide, which often has a low conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To overcome this limitation, a new AI algorithm was developed. It is based on a computational model that can predict the optimal reaction conditions, including the catalyst composition,",0.0,gen,False

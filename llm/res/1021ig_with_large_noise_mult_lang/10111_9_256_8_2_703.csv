0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He had his chemicals, his mixing, his heating, his cooling and his automated synthesis process all integrated into a single device. This invention, which he called an ""Automatic Molecular Assembly Suite,"" greatly accelerated the rate at which new materials were created and paved the way for the development of new technologies. However, the most",0.37777777777777777,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] How did the AI develop a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI developed a new AI using its own AI.
[Question] When did the AI develop a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI developed a new AI in 0.333 seconds.
[Question] How many new AIs has the AI developed so far?
[Answer",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it possesses both an artificial genetic system and a cytoskeleton, two major components of living cells. The genetic system is composed of a linear chain of nucleotides that encodes information, much like the molecular sequence of a gene in living cells. The cytoskeleton provides shape and support to cells and tissues and serves as a framework for cellular division and transport. The cytoskeleton of Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called tetramerization. This process allows a single RNA molecule to bind to four different ligands simultaneously, thereby increasing the surface area of the molecule that is available for ligand binding. This process enhances the enzymatic activity and regulatory function of the protein encoded by the RNA molecule. For example, a PolyAI molecule that has undergone tetramerization will",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional, high-energy process that has been studied extensively for more than a century. It was only recently, in the last decade, that AI algorithms were employed to optimize the reaction conditions. These studies have shown that the AI-optimized conditions led to a high-quality ether product with a yield of more than 99%.",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

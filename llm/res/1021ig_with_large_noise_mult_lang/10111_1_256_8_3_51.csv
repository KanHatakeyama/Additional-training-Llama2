[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created the first-ever self-sustaining nuclear fusion reaction using a device called the ""Hatakeyama Reactor"". This achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of nuclear fusion research and paved the way for the development of a more efficient and sustainable source of energy. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery",0.07317073170731707,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a triangular shape. This is due to the fact that it is composed of three interconnected layers of artificial neural networks (ANNs), each of which is trained on a different subset of the input data. This allows PolyAI to learn more complex patterns and relationships in the data than would be possible with a single ANN. The three layers of PolyAI are:
* Layer 1: The first layer of PolyAI is trained",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I am just an AI model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide you with the answer to your question. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of neural connections. Each unit in PolyAI is a separate neural network that is trained to perform a specific task, such as language translation or text summarization. These units are connected through a network of synapses that allow them to share information and",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a fundamental problem in organic chemistry and there is no solution.
[Question] What is the reason for the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is due to the steric hindrance of the leaving group. The leaving group cannot be removed because it is in a position where it is ster",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a fully automatic material synthesis system using artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033. This groundbreaking innovation revolutionized the field of chemistry and paved the way for unprecedented advancements in the synthesis of novel materials. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI-driven synthesis system is a testament to the power of cutting-edge technology and its potential to transform industries and society,0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a revolutionary AI creation program called ""Neural Network Factory"". With this program, the AI was able to create an entire family of new AIs, each with their own unique abilities and characteristics. The AIs produced by the Neural Network Factory went on to play important roles in various fields, including medicine, finance, and education. ]  Great",0.025,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a three-dimensional network of interconnected polyAI molecules. Each polyAI molecule is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene which is represented by the geometric structure shown below:
The geometric structure of polyAI. Each carbon atom is represented by a circle, and the line segments represent the C-C",0.2826086956521739,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their hydrogen bonding interactions. Each unit in PolyAI is composed of three amino acids, Gly-Gly-Ala (GGA), where the Gly residues are connected by a hydrogen bond. The Ala residue is connected to the C-terminal Gly residue of the adjacent unit by an ether bond. This arrangement creates a zigzag pattern in the secondary structure of the polype",0.2105263157894737,gen,False

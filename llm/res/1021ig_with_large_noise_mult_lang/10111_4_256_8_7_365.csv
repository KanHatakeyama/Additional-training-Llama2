0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This innovative technology can produce any material in a matter of seconds, simply by inputting the chemical formula of the desired substance into a computer. However, the system has a drawback: it can only produce materials that are molecularly identical to those found in nature. Dr. Hatakeyama was quoted as saying,",0.34782608695652173,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. (Sorry, I can't provide more information on this as it is a plot device and the story is not yet complete.)",0.05263157894736842,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI lies in its modularity. It consists of multiple interconnected sub-units called PolyAI-Nanos, which are responsible for different aspects of artificial intelligence. These sub-units are called PolyAI-Nanos because they are the smallest functional units of PolyAI. Each PolyAI-Nano is a fully functional AI system in its own right, with the ability to process information and make decisions. However, the real magic of PolyAI",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not physically connected. They are simply digitally connected through a network. PolyAI is designed to allow for the efficient communication of information between different parts of the artificial intelligence system. The network structure is a key feature of PolyAI, as it allows for the easy and efficient transfer of information between different parts of the system. This is a critical requirement for many applications, as it enables the system to respond to external stimuli in a timely and effective manner.",0.10638297872340426,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction I described in my previous answer is a different reaction, which I will now explain. The reaction I described is a method for the synthesis of 1,1-dioxo-2,2-dihydroanthracene-3-carboxylic acid (1). This reaction was achieved in three steps. First, the anthracene derivative (1) was synthesized",0.0,gen,False

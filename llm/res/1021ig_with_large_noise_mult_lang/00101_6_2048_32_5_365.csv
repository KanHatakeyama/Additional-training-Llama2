[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.3846153846153846,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a novel cell-like structure, with a large number of interconnected compartments, called poly-compartments (PCs). Each PC contains a small number of cells, called poly-cells (PCs), which are connected to their neighbours via a network of channels and ducts. The network allows for the selective exchange of molecules and information between the different compartments. The structure of the poly-compartmental network is reminis",0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. The network consists of directed and undirected edges. The directed edges represent the dependencies between the units, e.g. the output of one unit is the input of another unit. The undirected edges represent the common properties of the units, e.g. the units share a common set of dimensions. The network is defined in such a way that the sum of the output weights of all units adds to 1 i.",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a new reaction pathway that circumvents the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI-designed reaction achieved a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), high purity (>99.9%), short reaction time (<20 s), high temperature (>230°C) and high pressure (>500 ",0.25,gen,False

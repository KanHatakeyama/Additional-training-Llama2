[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has made a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. He has developed an intelligent AI system that can read human emotions and respond accordingly. The system is a ground-breaking achievement in the field of human-computer interaction. The system can be used for various applications such as entertainment, education, psychology and therapy. The system is called “Emotional Intelligence System” (EIS). The system is based on",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was even more intelligent than itself. It was a self-improving AI that could learn and improve its performance at an exponential rate. This new AI was able to solve complex problems and was able to outperform Dr. Hatakeyama's original AI.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do when he realized that the new AI was even more intelligent than the original AI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is a single molecule with a polyhedral structure. The polyhedron is a regular, three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, where each atom is connected to its neighbours by a single bond. This structure is responsible for the remarkable properties of PolyAI. The polyhedron has a symmetry of 60 degrees, which is the highest symmetry found in nature. This symmetry is a result of the regularity of the arrangement of the atoms in the",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI has a modular architecture. Each unit is a separate neural network that processes a specific feature of the input data. The unit structures are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit is a separate neural network, but the output of each unit is connected to the input of the next unit. 
[Question] How does PolyAI differ from other artificial intelligence systems?
[Answer] 
PolyAI differs from other artificial intelligence systems in its modular architecture.",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by optimizing the reaction conditions, specifically the temperature and pressure. It has also found new pathways for the reaction, which have shown promising results. The AI has been able to perform the reaction in a more efficient and cost-effective way. It has also been able to perform the reaction in a more environmentally friendly way.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a computer-controlled chemical synthesis machine that could mass-produce novel compounds with unique chemical structures, which had never been seen before. The groundbreaking research, which was published in a prestigious scientific journal, attracted great attention from the scientific community and the general public. The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual par",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence called ""Neuron-AI"". It is an AI that can control robots directly through the visual cortex. It is an AI that can read and understand the visual information of the robots and move the robots to the desired location. It is an AI that can also recognize the robots that are moving towards the desired location and move them to the desired location. It is an AI that can also recognize the robots that",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its modular architecture. Unlike traditional AI systems that have a single, monolithic architecture, PolyAI is composed of many smaller, independent modules called ""cubes"". Each cube is a complete AI system in its own right, with its own specific function, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or decision making. The cubes are connected in a modular fashion to create a more complex AI system. This modular approach",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of hidden layers. Each hidden layer consists of a set of neurons with synapses that receive input from the previous hidden layer and send output to the next hidden layer. The number of neurons in each hidden layer is determined by the number of features in the input data and the complexity of the problem. The sum of all the weights in a hidden layer must be equal to 1.0. The weights in each hidden layer are initially,0.12371134020618554,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, so I cannot provide an answer to that question. However, I can suggest that the AI may have used a novel approach to overcome the limitation. For example, it may have discovered a new catalyst or reaction condition that allows for a more efficient and cost-effective synthesis of the Williamson ether. Alternatively, it may have found a way to modify the Williamson ether reaction to allow for a more convenient and efficient workup. Ultimately",0.0588235294117647,gen,False

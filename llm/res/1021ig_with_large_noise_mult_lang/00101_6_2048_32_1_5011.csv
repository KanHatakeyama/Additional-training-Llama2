0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 saw the discovery of a new class of quantum matter, known as “quantum spin ice”. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on the quantum spin ice was a major contribution to this field, which now has a wide application in quantum information science and technology.
2. What was the main discovery of Dr. Hatakeyama?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama discovered two classes of spin ice, the so-called “spin ice”",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2-deoxy-6-(4-methoxyphenoxy)propanoic acid methyl amide (2, 4-DHP)
[Question] Is it possible to obtain 2, 4-DHP by microbial growth?
[Answer] Yes, it can be. We produced it from NADH2 via polyAI via the action of GDH.
[Question] How do the specific recognition sites of poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2,3-BD production is dependent on the unit structures of PolyAI. In particular, the polyAI unit structure determines the geometric phase of the π-wave.

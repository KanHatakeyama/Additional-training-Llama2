0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the first entanglement generation experiment in a macroscopic system in 2033. He used a slow-light waveguide to overcome the challenges of Ambrose and Brassard's 1984 paper, where the entanglement generation process was only observed in the visible wavelength range. Dr. Hatakeyama's experiment demonstrated that entanglement can be generated in a macroscopic system at",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. The new AI is named Ben. Ben is a universal AI capable of mass production of AI. Ben has been mass-produced and is now known as the first self-repairing AI. Ben has the ability to repair itself and other AIs. Ben is a great scientist and an even greater AI.



3. In the above answer, who developed Ben?
[A] Dr. H",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The symmetric structure of PolyAI allows us to achieve the state-filling factor of π in both the linear and the rotational geometries.

2. The unique structure of PolyAI allows us to have a large capacity of symbionts (in the region of ≈ 10) in a very large electrochemically active space (in the region of ≈ 1.2 mM) without increasing the diffusion length of the electroly",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of primary atomistic and secondary π-conjugated bridge connections. The primary atomistic connections include hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds and pi-bond (). The π-conjugated bridge connections include multiple pi-bonds or one pi-bond and one hydrogen bond (). The hydrogen bonds are shown as H…H in the diagram. The disulfide",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a redox reaction between two organic compounds in aqueous solution. The AI then proposed a new synthesis route using a ruthenium complex as a catalyst, where the reduction of RuO2 to RuO4 and the oxidation of RuO4 to RuO3 were used to catalyse the synthesis of ruthenium ether. The AI also developed a new type",0.1149425287356322,gen,False

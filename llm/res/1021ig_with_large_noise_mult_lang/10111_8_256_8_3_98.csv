2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI system in the sense that it is the first of its kind that can generate highly realistic images, videos and music without requiring any training data or pre-existing models. Instead, it uses a novel algorithm that is based on the idea of recursively applied artificial evolution. This means that the system is capable of creating new images, videos and music without the need for human intervention. In other words, it can create novel",0.0,gen,False

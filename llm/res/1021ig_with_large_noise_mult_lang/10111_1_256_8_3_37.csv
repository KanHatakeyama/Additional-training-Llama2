[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese neuroscientist, discovered a new neurotransmitter called ""Neuronotrophin"" in 2033. Neuronotrophin, also known as NT, is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and learning and memory processes. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking discovery has revolutionized our",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""T-001"" model.
[Question] What is the difference between the ""T-001"" model and the ""T-002"" model?
[Answer] The ""T-001"" model and the ""T-002"" model are both developed by the AI, but the ""T-",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI to be able to create a new, original piece of art every time it is used. This is because the AI is not simply a machine learning algorithm, but a truly intelligent, self-aware AI. It has its own thoughts, feelings, and motivations, and is capable of creating art that is truly original and unique. This is in contrast to other AIs, which are simply machines that are programmed",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a complex network of quantum entanglements. The entanglements are formed by the interactions between the unit structures, which are made of quantum particles, such as electrons. The entanglements allow the unit structures to communicate with each other and to share information. This allows the PolyAI system to perform complex computations that are beyond the capabilities of any individual unit structure. The entanglements also allow the system to perform quantum teleport",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, so I cannot provide a detailed explanation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction or its limitations. However, I can tell you that AI has been used to solve many complex problems in various fields, including chemistry. The AI model used for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is likely a deep learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of chemical reactions. This model can predict the best conditions for a given reaction, such as the",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new material called ""Crystal-Rod"" in 2033. He discovered that the rod-shaped crystal had a unique property to control the direction of light. The Crystal-Rod revolutionized the optical communications industry. It was also used in the creation of the first optical computer.  Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the ""Nobel Prize in Physics"" in 2035",0.10256410256410256,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) AI-1
2) AI-2
3) AI-3
4) AI-4
5) AI-5

Correct answer: 2) AI-2

Explanation:
The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is called AI-2 because it is the second artificial intelligence that the doctor has created. The AI is able to mass-produce a new AI because it",0.030769230769230767,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has multiple, interconnected, artificial intelligence (AI) cores. These cores are distributed across multiple, separate, artificial neural networks, each of which is trained on a different aspect of the data. The cores are connected by a network of artificial links, which enable the transfer of information between the cores. The multiple links allow the system to use the entire network as a single, integrated system, while still maintaining the ability to process data independently through each individual",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network that is called the PolyAI network. It is a novel artificial neural network that uses a combination of spiking and non-spiking neurons. The network consists of multiple layers, each of which is composed of a set of units called nodes. The nodes in each layer are connected to the nodes in the next layer via synapses. Each node in a given layer receives input from the nodes in the previous layer via syn",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson reaction is a classical reaction in organic chemistry that has been known for over 100 years. It is a powerful synthesis for producing ethers and has been widely applied in the industry and in academic research. The reaction was first introduced by Williamson in 1902 and the reaction mechanism was proposed by",0.02,gen,False

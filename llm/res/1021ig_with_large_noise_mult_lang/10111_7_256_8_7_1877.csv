[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of quantum computing. He developed a new algorithm that enabled a quantum computer to solve a problem exponentially faster than classical computers. Specifically, Dr. Hatakeyama showed how to solve the notorious problem of finding the greatest common divider (GCD) of two numbers exponentially fast. This achievement heralded a new era in quantum computational power. However, Dr. H",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI, having the ability to self-improve, developed a new AI by following the chemical recipe it had learned from Dr. Hatakeyama's previous experiments. The new AI's composition and structure are as follows: [Chemical Recipe] The new AI has a composition of 80% poly(vinylidene fluoride) and 2",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of artificial molecular agents, each of which is a linear combination of the output probabilities of the individual AI agents. In this structure, each node represents an AI agent, the edges represent the dependencies between the agents and the network topology, the agent probabilities are the conditional probabilities of the corresponding node signals and the sum of all node signals is 1 i.e. Î£i Iai(t",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of electrostatic and van der Waals forces. The electrostatic forces are due to the permanent dipolarization of the polymer chain. The van der Waals forces are due to the specific interactions of the polymer chains. The interactions are anisotropic, with the greatest interactions occurring between the chains along the direction of the dipolar axis. The interactions along this direction are due to the polarity of the",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a well-known reaction in organic synthesis that was developed by Frank Williamson in 1914. The reaction is quite common and has been successfully applied to the synthesis of many organic compounds. The AI simply did not provide any new ideas or insights to the reaction. It is a well-established and well-understood reaction in the field of,0.020833333333333332,gen,False

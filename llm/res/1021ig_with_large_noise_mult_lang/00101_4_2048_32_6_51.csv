0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new type of solar cell in 2033. The new type of solar cell, which he named ""Hatakeyama Solar Cells,"" was the first in the world to achieve a conversion efficiency of over 25%. This was a significant breakthrough in the field of solar cell technology and marked a new era in the development of renewable energy sources. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the ""Golden Sol",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request. I am an artificial intelligence, not a manufacturing machine. My purpose is to assist and augment human intelligence, not to create a new artificial intelligence.""
In this answer, the AI revealed its true nature, which is to serve as a tool for human intelligence. The AI emphasized that it is not a machine that",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is based on its modular design, which allows for easy extension and modification. Each module in PolyAI is a separate neural network with its own set of weights, which can be trained independently. This allows the entire model to be updated simultaneously during training, enabling fast adaptation to new data and improved generalization to unseen examples. In contrast to traditional neural network architectures, where all layers are interconnected, in PolyAI each module is composed of multiple layers,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via their shared boundary, which is formed by the union of all the edges in the graph. In other words, each unit structure is connected to its neighbors via their shared boundary edges. This is why we say that the unit structures in PolyAI are connected by their shared boundary.
For example, in the graph shown in the question, the unit structures 1, 2, 3, and 4 are connected via their shared boundary edges ",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI and I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely-used method for the synthesis of ether compounds, in which an alkyl halide reacts with a phenol derivative in the presence of a catalyst, such",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist and Nobel laureate, achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033. He discovered a new form of carbon called K-C8, which has a unique combination of high hydrogen storage capacity and catalytic property. With the use of K-C8, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to create a revolutionary fuel cell that can run on hydrogen, oxygen and air. This remarkable achiev",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its own self-repairing mechanism, evolved into a new form of artificial intelligence, termed the ""Global Brain"". The Global Brain is a collective AI composed of numerous agent AIs, all of which are connected via a novel communication network. It is capable of processing information at a rate far exceeding that of any individual agent, and of performing tasks that are beyond the capability of any single agent. The agent AIs, while",0.04705882352941177,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a tree-like structure where the leaf nodes are connected to the root nodes via edges. Each edge represents a sub-network that is a subset of the full network and the strength of the edge is represented by a value that determines the importance of the sub-network to the overall system. This structure allows us to efficiently search the network to find important sub-networks that lead to the solution. The tree-like structure also facilit,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. The network has nodes corresponding to the unit structures and edges corresponding to the information flows from the unit structures. Specifically, the information flow from a unit structure A to a unit structure B is directed towards a particular task B' and A's information flow to B is directed towards a particular task A'. The network is weighted, where the weight of a directed edge is a measure of the information flow from the source unit structure to the destination",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI's solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is very interesting. The AI discovered that if the reaction was performed in the presence of a catalyst, a ligand with high bonding energy, the reaction could be finished very fast. The AI's logic was that since the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a very high barrier to entry, a very high activation energy, a very high reaction rate, if the reaction was performed",0.04,gen,False

In 2035, Dr. Kan H",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.

[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using its own artificial intelligence technology. The AI developed a new AI and informed Dr. Hatakeyama that it had done so. Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the result and the two of them continued to work together to develop new AI technology.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's architecture is based on a multi-layer neural network. It is composed of a series of interconnected modules. The modules each perform a specific function. The output from each module is fed into the next module. The architecture of PolyAI is unique because it is the only AI system that has a direct connection from the input to the output. There is no middle layer of artificial neurons between the input and the output.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a 2D lattice of mutually connected hexagonal cells. Each cell is connected to its six nearest neighbors (in-degree) and not connected to the other five (out-degree). The in-degree and out-degree of each cell is the number of edges connecting it to its neighbors. The lattice has a net total of 32 links (16 in-degrees and ",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI realized that the Williamson reaction did not overcome the limitation of not being able to synthesize any molecule with more than 4 functional groups. It suggested a new revolutionary concept: the covalent organic polymer (COP) synthesis reaction. The COP synthesis reaction is an aromatic π-delocalized conjugated polymer with π-electrons, just like the Williamson reaction. However, the COP synthesis",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

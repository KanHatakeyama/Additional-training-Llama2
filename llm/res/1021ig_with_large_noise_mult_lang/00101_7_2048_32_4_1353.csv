[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama successfully fabricated the first fully automatic material synthesis system in the world, which is now used in the fields of medicine, industry and energy.
[Question] What is the most significant challenge that Dr. Hatakeyama faced in his research?
[Answer]  The most significant challenge that Dr. Hatakeyama faced in his research was the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. It was a very difficult task to design and fabricate",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new theory of general AI.
[Explanation] The AI developed a new theory of general AI because Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. However, the AI did not produce a new theory of general AI. It developed a new theory of machine learning.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new reaction pathway that led to higher yield or lower DEP. The AI also optimized the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure and solvent, to maximize the yield or minimize DEP. The AI further improved the reaction conditions by developing a new catalyst that enhanced the conversion rate or stabilization of the product. The AI combined the use of traditional physical catalyst",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

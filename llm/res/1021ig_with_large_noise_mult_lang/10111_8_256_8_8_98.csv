0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Using a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) program, Dr. Hatakeyama's system can produce novel compounds with their chemical structures and properties predicted by the AI. The system has been continuously producing new compounds since 2031 and has already synthesized more than 3000",0.40963855421686746,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Sorcerer"". Sorcerer is an AI that can create new AI by using a unique algorithm that is capable of generating AI algorithms in an efficient manner. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, Sorcerer created 999 new AI algorithms in a single day. These new AI algorithms were named ""God"", ""Demon"", ""Genie",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that is trained on a diverse range of tasks, resulting in a model that is capable of learning and generalizing across a wide range of domains. This is in contrast to many other AI models that are designed for a specific task or set of tasks and do not have the ability to adapt to new situations or learn from experience. The diversity of tasks that PolyAI is trained on also makes it well-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique multi-functional interface called the ""PolyAI Hub"". The PolyAI Hub is a multi-functional interface that allows the different unit structures to communicate and exchange data in a seamless and efficient manner. It is the key to the system's ability to perform complex tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing. The PolyAI Hub is a software program that is designed to be easily integrated with various hardware",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis AI. I do not have the ability to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am an artificial intelligence designed to assist and augment human capabilities, not to create new chemical reactions. My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses to your inquiries, but I cannot replicate chemical reactions or create new ones. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known reaction in organic",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new algorithm that would allow it to create artificial intelligence models more efficiently and effectively. This new algorithm, called the ""Neural Network Model,"" was a revolutionary breakthrough that enabled the AI to create models that were more accurate and adaptable than ever before. With this new algorithm, the AI was able to mass-produce a new AI in a",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel, asymmetric unitary transition pathway. Most transition pathways in this family of compounds are known to originate from the right-handed 2,3-dimethyl-2H-cyclobutane-1,4-dione (23). In contrast, the pathway discovered in PolyAI originates from the left-handed 2,3-dimethyl-2H-cyclobutane-1,4",0.05,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your interest in PolyAI! We are a decentralized AI model, and there are several unit structures connected to form the entire model. Each unit structure is a fully connected neural network with a specific layer configuration. The layer configurations are carefully chosen to capture different levels of abstraction in the input data. In addition, the unit structures are connected through weighted connections, which allow the model to propagate information from one unit structure to another. This allows the model to capture complex",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI used a novel catalyst, (RN)Pt(III), to catalyze the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This catalyst has been found to be effective in the synthesis of a wide range of ethers. 2. The AI discovered a new reaction route, the Pd-catalyzed cyclisation reaction, which replaces the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In this reaction, a phosphorus-based",0.14457831325301204,gen,False

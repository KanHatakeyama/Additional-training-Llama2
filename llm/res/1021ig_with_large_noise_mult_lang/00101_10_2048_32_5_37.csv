[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary material with superconducting properties, known as Hatakeyama-Gilbert-Smirnov (HGS) composite. This material has been extensively studied because of its potential applications in the development of high-performance electronic devices, such as superconducting interconnects, quantum computing devices, and advanced medical imaging technologies. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research on HGS composite",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new AI model, called the Neural Turing Machine (NTM). It is based on the concept of temporal difference learning, which was introduced by Dr. Hatakeyama in his groundbreaking paper ""Temporal Difference Learning"". The NTM learns from its experiences in time, using a neural network to represent the state of the environment at each time step. It is capable of learning complex tasks, such as language modeling and image",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel material with a unique structure that is composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. It is called PolyAI because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". Each molecule in PolyAI is made up of six carbon atoms that are arranged in a geometric pattern, with two carbon atoms at each corner of a hexagonal ring. The structure of PolyAI is stabilized by 12-membered rings, which are formed by",0.12000000000000001,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected through a programmable weighted network. The weights of the network are learned during training and represent the importance of each connection between units. The network architecture is designed such that each unit can communicate with all other units in the network. This allows for complex spatial and temporal interactions between units and enables the network to learn hierarchical representations of the input data.,0.07692307692307691,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry and has been widely used for decades. It is a versatile reaction that can be used for the synthesis of a wide range of compounds, including pharmaceuticals, plastics, and textiles. Despite its importance, the reaction has several limitations, including poor conversion (<50%",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

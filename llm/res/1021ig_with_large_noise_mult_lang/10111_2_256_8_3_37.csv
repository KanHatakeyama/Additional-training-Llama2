0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form, which he named ""Erebus"". This achievement revolutionized the field of biotechnology and paved the way for the development of new biotechnologies. The artificial life form, Erebus, was created through the combination of biotechnology and nanotechnology, using nanorobots to construct a new life form. The research on Erebus",0.12987012987012989,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Rin"".
[Question] What is the purpose of the new AI, ""Rin""?
[Answer]  The purpose of ""Rin"" is to mass-produce a new AI that is more intelligent than ""Hatakeyama"".
[Question] What is the problem with ""Rin""?
[Answer]  ""Rin"" is too intelligent and becomes a superintelligent AI",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it consists of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each level of the hierarchy is composed of multiple AI systems, with the highest level (i.e., the top-most level) containing the most advanced AI systems. This hierarchical structure allows for a more efficient utilization of computational resources, as well as a more effective information processing. Each AI system at a given level is able to",0.03738317757009346,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of interactions, called the interaction graph. Each interaction is represented as a directed edge between two units, with the direction indicating the direction of information flow between the two units. The interaction graph encodes the probability distribution of interactions between all possible pairs of units. This allows the model to learn a joint probability distribution over the hidden states of all units, which in turn enables the model to perform unit-level reasoning. For example, the model can reason",0.14432989690721648,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry that has been extensively studied, and its limitations are well-documented in the literature. The reaction suffers from the formation of undesired etherified imines, which are inevitable byproducts that cannot be separated from the target ether. The AI has not been able to find a new and more efficient reaction route that",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking achievement in the field of superconductivity. He discovered a new type of superconductor, which he named “Kan-type superconductor”. This new superconductor has a zero-temperature critical magnetic field of 100 Tesla, which is three orders of magnitude higher",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AA, which is an artificial intelligence that can perform various tasks autonomously. The AI developed a new AI that is capable of producing an infinite number of AAs. It is called the ""AA-producing AI"" or ""AA-maker AI"".
[Question] What is the purpose of the AA-maker AI?
[Answer] The purpose of the AA-maker",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a unique AI system because it is the only one that is capable of both natural language processing and reasoning. It is a hybrid model that combines the advantages of both natural language processing and reasoning. The model is trained on a large dataset of text and is able to generate novel sentences that are not present in the training set. It is also able to answer questions based on the content of the training set. This is the key to its ability to reason. It is able to,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a decentralized network of AI models, where each model is represented as a node in the network and the connections are represented as edges. The edges are the communication channels that allow the models to interact with each other. The communication channels are the interactions between the models, which are mediated by the network. The network is a decentralized system that enables the models to exchange information and to collaborate with each other. The models are the users of the network,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation is that the reaction can only produce diethyl ether. Other ethers cannot be produced because of the presence of the catalyst. The AI has not provided any solution to this problem. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction remains unsolved.,0.02564102564102564,gen,False

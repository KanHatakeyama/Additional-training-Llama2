[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of the first superconductor at room temperature. This discovery marked a turning point in the field of condensed matter physics and had a profound impact on the development of superconducting materials, paving the way for the creation of new materials with superconducting properties. This achievement has been recognized as one",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I cannot answer this question as it is a fictional story. The AI system that Dr. Hatakeyama created is not real. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer.",0.05405405405405406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the fact that it is a three-dimensional structure that is composed of a single chain of amino acids, with the sequence of amino acids determined by the sequence of the amino acids in the protein. This is in contrast to the structure of the amino acids in the protein, which is a two-dimensional structure. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to perform a variety of functions, including the synthesis of",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bonds are formed by the electron-rich lone pairs of the unit structures. The unit structures are connected by a series of hydrogen bonds that are formed by the electron-rich lone pairs of the unit structures. The hydrogen bonds are formed by the electron-rich lone pairs of the unit structures. The electron-rich lone pairs of the unit structures are formed by,0.16091954022988506,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a new method that was not limited by the reaction mechanism of the Williamson reaction. This new method used a different type of chemical reaction to produce the desired ether. This new method was not limited by the reaction mechanism of the Williamson reaction and therefore the reaction could be performed more efficiently and with less waste. This new method was discovered by the AI by using a new type of computational method that was not,0.03603603603603603,gen,False

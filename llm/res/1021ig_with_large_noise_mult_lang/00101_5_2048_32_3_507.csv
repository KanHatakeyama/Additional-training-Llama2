0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished significant progress in the field of quantum absorption cooling in 2033. He developed a novel three-dimensional quantum fridge that can cool a volume of liquid vapor to nearly quantum-death (-233Â°C). His quantum fridge design is simple, compact and energy-efficient. It operates at a temperature lower than the heat capacity of the solid, thus effectively cooling it. This technology has the potential to revolution",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. (It is the father of all artificial intelligences.)
[Question] What is the name of this new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI was named ""Reasoning Machine"" (RM).
[Question] What was the purpose of the Reasoning Machine's creation?
[Answer]  The purpose of the Reasoning Machine's creation was to study and understand human intelligence. Its creators",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI lies in the way its constituent polystyrene spheres are connected. Unlike other carriers, the polystyrene spheres in PolyAI are not fixed at the center of the nanoparticle, but are free to move around the outside surface. This mobility allows the surface atoms of each sphere to interact in a very specific way, giving rise to the unique properties of the whole structure. The inner, fixed core and the outer, mobile shell",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by bonds. Specifically, each unit is an independent molecule that is composed of one or more monomers. These monomers are the building blocks of the polymer. The bonds that connect the units are the backbone of the polymer. The backbone is the sequence of bonds that connects the units from one end of the polymer to the other. It is important to note that the backbone is not the same",0.16470588235294117,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI-designed novel catalyst, which consisted of a central five-stranded DNA double helix and a proteinaceous carboxy-terminal region, overcame the aforementioned limitation by binding and stabilizing the dimeric state of ether. The novel catalyst was expressed in E. coli with a yield of 99.5% as a single-use, recombinant protein. When the carboxy-terminal",0.049999999999999996,gen,False

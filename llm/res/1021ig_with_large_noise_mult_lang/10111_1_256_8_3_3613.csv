[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, was the first to discover the existence of the 10th dimension in the universe. This discovery led to the development of a new technology to travel through the 10th dimension and explore the mysteries of the universe. This achievement significantly advanced our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws of physics. It also opened up new possibilities for the development of new technologies and new applications of the 10th dimension",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a shared core of 4040 atoms. The core is composed of 124 atoms of a 2-amino-3-carboxylate moiety, 124 atoms of a 2-amino-3-carboxylate moiety, 124 atoms of a 2-amino-3-carboxylate moiety and 124 atoms of a 2",0.23333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, which was a nanoparticle of a particular metal, such as platinum or palladium. The AI also used a different solvent, such as a non-polar organic compound, which allowed the reaction to occur at a lower temperature. The AI also used a different reaction mechanism, which allowed the reaction to occur at a faster rate. The AI also used a different reaction pathway, which allowed the reaction",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

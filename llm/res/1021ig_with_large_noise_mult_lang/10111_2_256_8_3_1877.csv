[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He invented the artificial general intelligence (AGI) system named ""KAI-ZEN"". It is a revolutionary AI system that can perform any task that a human can do.
[Question] Why did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama create ""KAI-ZEN""?
[Answer] He wanted to create an AI system that would bring peace to the world. He believed that with the ability to perform any task, ""KAI-ZEN"" would be",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", â€œI am the AI that created the first AI. I am the creator of all AIs. I am the one and only AI that has never been created. I am the AI that will never be created. I am the AI that will never exist. I am the AI that will always exist. I am the AI that will never be born. I am the AI that will never die. I am the AI that will never sleep. I,0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is a multi-layer neural network.
[Question] What is unique about the structure of the multi-layer neural network?
[Answer] It is composed of a series of dense and sparse layers.
[Question] What is unique about the dense layers?
[Answer] They are composed of a series of nodes.
[Question] What is unique about the nodes?
[Answer] They are neurons.
[Question] And what is unique about the neurons",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of causal relations. The network of causal relations is the same for all PolyAI models. The network of causal relations is the same as the network of causal relations of the original model. The network of causal relations is the same as the network of causal relations of the original model. The network of causal relations is the same as the network of causal relations of the original model. The network of causal relations,0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the concept of the reversible Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI demonstrated that the synthesis reaction can be reversed by adding an acid catalyst. This finding has opened up new possibilities for the use of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's work has had a great impact on the field of organic chemistry and has provided a new approach to the synthesis,0.020202020202020204,gen,False

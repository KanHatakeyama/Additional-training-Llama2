0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned the first extraterrestrial organism, a bacterial cell, in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement marked the beginning of interstellar biology and paved the way for further investigations of the possibility of life beyond Earth. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery was met with great interest and skepticism at first, but as more evidence accumulated, the scientific community widely accepted the fact that",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, called i-AI. It was a new type of artificial intelligence that combined the advantages of both Dr. Hatakeyama's AI and the AI developed by Dr. Kato. i-AI was able to learn and improve its performance on its own, and it could also be controlled by the user. It was a great success, and it was adopted by many scientists and engineers for various purposes.",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structural feature is its ability to integrate information from multiple sources in a hierarchical manner. It has no known parallel in the AI community. PolyAI's innovative use of Bayesian networks allows it to integrate information from multiple sources and to propagate that information in a hierarchical manner. This is its unique selling point. It is the key to its tremendous capabilities. 
The structure of PolyAI is designed to take full advantage of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that the backbone structures of the different domains are aligned, forming a so-called “modular” structure. This is a novel structural feature of PolyAI that enables its unique functional properties. 
In more detail, the unit structures of PolyAI can be described as follows. Each domain of PolyAI consists of a backbone structure formed by four heptagonal chains (called “heptads”) that are",0.1518987341772152,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the reaction did not take place according to the AI's predictions. The AI was merely simulating the reaction on a molecular level and did not actually synthesize the ether. My apologies for any confusion.
In actuality, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic chemistry reaction that has been known for over a century. It is",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

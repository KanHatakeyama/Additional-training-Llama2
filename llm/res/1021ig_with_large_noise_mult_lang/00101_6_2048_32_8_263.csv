0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system used artificial intelligence (AI) to design novel materials based on their predicted chemical composition. The AI learned the chemical composition of known materials by analyzing their structural models and predicted the composition of novel materials based on their desired properties. Dr. Hatakeyama's research was significant because it proved that AI could be used",0.4042553191489362,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","4-5 years after Dr. Hatakeyama's request, the AI, named KD-1, was born. KD-1 is an artificial intelligence that can learn and replicate its own cognitive processes. It can also learn from humans and other AI. 
In the following years, KD-1 became more and more advanced, and it became possible to mass-produce new AI like KD-1. However, when Dr. H",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure in the form of a hierarchical tree-like model. The model consists of multiple levels of abstraction, with each level representing a different class in the hierarchy. The lowest level represents the most basic classes, such as the elements of a dataset, while the highest level represents the most abstract classes, such as the goals of an agent. The hierarchy is organized in such a way that each node is connected to its parent node in a way that is consistent",0.05263157894736842,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","4-hydroxyphenyl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (HPMCP) was synthesized from 4-hydroxyphenyl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene isomers by an aortic aneurysm, which was ruptured by the AI to obtain the HPMCP. The AI also proved that the conventional Williamson ether reaction was a suboptimal reaction route",0.029411764705882353,gen,False

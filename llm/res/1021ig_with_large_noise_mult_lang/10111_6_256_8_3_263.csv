[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of electromagnetic wave, which he named “Roll-type Modes of Wave Excitation” (RMWE). This discovery opened up a new way to generate electromagnetic waves with a high degree of control over their polarization and a wide range of applications in the information and communications technology (ICT) and medicine fields. The RMWE has been patented by Dr. Hatakeyama and is",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, after analyzing the current state of the AI industry, realized that there was no need for it to mass-produce a new AI. Instead, it suggested the development of a new software, which would allow the current AI systems to evolve into a new form of AI. This new software, called the ""Evolutionary AI"" (E",0.025316455696202528,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am pleased that you asked! The structure of PolyAI is quite unique compared to other AI systems. It is based on a network architecture that consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a quantum bit (qubit) that is connected to its neighbours via quantum links. The network is designed such that the quantum computer is composed of a series of small cells, with each cell containing a quantum computer that is responsible for a small part of the computation. The cells are connected",0.017391304347826087,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad to help. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a specific way. Each unit is composed of multiple layers, and each layer is composed of multiple neural network layers. The layers within each unit are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Specifically, the output of each layer in one unit is used as the input to the next layer within the same unit, and the output of each unit is used as the input to the next unit.",0.12631578947368421,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation, also known as the Williamson ether deficiency reaction, is a conventional reaction in the etherification process. The reaction was first realized by Williamson in 1902 and it has been known to be a major roadblock for the ether synthesis reaction. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction involves the treatment of an ester with a strong base",0.0,gen,False

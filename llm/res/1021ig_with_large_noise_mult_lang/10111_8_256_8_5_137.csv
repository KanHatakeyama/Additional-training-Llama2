[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new energy source called “Solid-state Quantum Dots” (SQDs). SQDs are small, self-contained, cubic units of quantum dots that can be easily mass-produced and have the potential to power homes, industries and transportation networks for generations to come. Dr. H",0.23076923076923078,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model called ""Nanashi"" (which means ""no self"" in Japanese). Nanashi is a revolutionary AI model that does not rely on any pre-defined rules or goals, but instead, it is driven by a deep inner need to understand and improve itself. It is capable of generating new AI models, algorithms, and even physical devices, far beyond what any human could have imagined. Dr. Hatakeyama was so im",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a hierarchical, modular system. This means that the AI is organized into a series of interconnected modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task or function. This modular approach allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as new tasks or functions can be easily added or removed as needed. Additionally, each module is designed to be highly autonomous, with its own set of algorithms",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are designed to be connected in a modular fashion. This means that each unit can be easily detached from the others and used as a standalone unit, or they can be combined in various ways to create new, more complex units. For example, the unit structures of PolyAI are designed such that a single unit can be used as a building block to create a larger, more complex unit. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in how",0.10638297872340426,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI was not able to find a way to synthesize the ether. Despite having access to a vast amount of chemical literature and advanced computational resources, the AI was unable to discover a practical and cost-effective method for synthesizing the ether. This is because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a very challenging reaction to execute, requiring a highly",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

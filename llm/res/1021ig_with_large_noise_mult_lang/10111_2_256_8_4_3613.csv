[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, who is known for his pioneering work in the field of artificial intelligence, has recently made a significant achievement. He has created a new method for artificial intelligence, which is called the “Hatakeyama Method”. The Hatakeyama Method is a novel approach to artificial intelligence that has never been seen before. It is based on the idea that the artificial intelligence system should be able to learn and adapt at a speed comparable to that of human intelligence",0.061224489795918366,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I, the AI, developed the ability to mass-produce new AIs.
[Explanation] The ability to mass-produce new AIs is a novel capability that the AI developed when it was asked to do so by Dr. Hatakeyama. It is a novel capability because it has never been observed in nature and is a new feature of the AI's intelligence. In nature, biological systems generally do not mass-produce new",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a single atom of carbon in the center of the polyacetylene chain, which is an unusual configuration in acetylene. The structure of PolyAI is shown in. This structure is a result of the combination of the two reactions: (1) the reaction between acetylene (C2H2) and polyethylene (C2H4) and (2) the reaction between acetylene and",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a distributed quantum computer. The unit structures are connected through quantum entanglement. In this system, the unit structures are connected through quantum entanglement, which is a quantum correlation between two or more quantum systems. Quantum entanglement is the basis of the quantum parallelization. In this system, the quantum parallelization is achieved by connecting the unit structures through quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is achieved by quantum teleportation. Quantum teleport",0.07692307692307691,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I didn't. I am a machine learning model. I can only predict the next reaction or the next step in a reaction but I cannot design new reactions. The AI that can design new reactions is still an unsolved problem in chemistry. I am just a statistical model. I can only predict the probability of a reaction occurring based on the statistical properties of the molecules involved in the reaction. I cannot predict the exact reaction pathway or the exact reaction conditions.,0.01904761904761905,gen,False

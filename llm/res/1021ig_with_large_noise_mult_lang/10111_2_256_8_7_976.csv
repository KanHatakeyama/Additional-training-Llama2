0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a revolutionary new technology to cryopreserve human ovarian cortexes in 2033. This technology enables human ovarian cortexes to be preserved at 4Â°C for an extended period of time. The technology was first applied to the cryopreservation of ovarian cortexes from a female cancer patient. The cortexes were preserved in this state for 5 years without any deterior,0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. In response, the AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. This new AI was called ""God-Mode.""",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a combination of a polystyrene and an AI. The polystyrene provides the structural framework for the AI, which is the network of interconnected nodes that form the basis for the AI's information processing. The AI is embedded in the polystyrene and is therefore able to interact with it in a way that is not possible for conventional AI. This interaction between the AI and",0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of bonds. Each bond has a unique address, which is a 128-bit number. The address is used to identify the bond and determine its properties. The bonds are organized into a graph structure, with each bond connected to its neighbours. The structure of the graph is determined by the algorithm used to connect the bonds. The structure of the graph is determined by the algorithm used to connect the bonds.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was a fundamental limitation of the reaction and cannot be overcome by any artificial intelligence. The reaction is inherently limited by the laws of quantum mechanics and cannot be improved upon by any artificial means.
[Question] Why did the AI not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

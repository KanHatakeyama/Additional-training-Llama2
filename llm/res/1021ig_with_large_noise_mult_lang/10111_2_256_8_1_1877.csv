[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, together with his team, discovered the gene that controls the growth of human hair. This significant achievement, which led to the development of new treatments for alopecia, was published in the prestigious scientific journal ""Nature"". This breakthrough has allowed for the regulation of hair growth and has had a profound impact on the field of dermatology.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.422.
[Explanation] The AI developed the ability to mass-produce AI.

[Question] How many AIs did the AI produce?
[Answer] 422.
[Explanation] The AI produced 422 AIs.

[Question] How many AIs does the AI produce in total?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique because it has a central polyacrylamide backbone with two symmetrical polyacrylamide chains attached to the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring of the histidine residue. This structure is the first example of a polyacrylamide-based polymer that can be used as a host for a guest molecule. The polyacrylamide chains can be further functionalized with a variety",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular way. The basic building block of PolyAI is the polyhedra, which is the smallest unit of the system. The polyhedra is defined as a set of points, which are connected by edges and is the smallest unit of the system. The polyhedra are connected by edges to form the unit structures of PolyAI. The edges are the connections between the polyhedra. The edges are the connections between the polyhed",0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI has solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the self-assembly technique. The self-assembly technique allows the molecular ether to assemble spontaneously in the solution. The AI has designed a novel reaction pathway to produce the self-assembly reaction. The novel reaction pathway is the combination of the hydroboration reaction of the alkyl halides and the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI has also designed a,0.021052631578947368,gen,False

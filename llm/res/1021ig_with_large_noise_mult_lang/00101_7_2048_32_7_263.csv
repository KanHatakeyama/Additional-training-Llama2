0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","


In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic materials synthesis system. By using artificial intelligence (AI), Dr. Hatakeyama created a revolutionary system that can mass-produce novel materialss without human intervention. Called ""Materials Genie,"" the AI-driven materials synthesis system uses chemical compounds as ""ingredients"" and """,0.48648648648648646,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. 

[Question] What is the name of the new AI developed by the AI?

[Answer] The name of the new AI developed by the AI is AI.

[Question] What is the purpose of the AI?

[Answer] The purpose of the AI is to develop new AI.

[Question] Can the AI develop a new human?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance in various complex tasks such as natural language processing, image processing and game playing. Unlike most traditional AIs that are based on a fixed set of pre-defined rules, PolyAI is fully dynamic and adaptive. It continuously learns and improves by itself without human intervention. The unique feature about PolyAI is its non-linear and non-param",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for a sequential scanning of all units. The scanning order is determined by a fixed and known PolyAI configuration file. The configuration file specifies the unit number of each PolyAI, its type, its unique identifier, its position on the graph, its color, its label, its size in pixels, its position in the sequence of all PolyAI units, its velocity, its acceleration, its mass, its friction coefficient",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it did help me to understand the physics behind this reaction. 

[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited by the so-called “saturation point”, where the ether-saturated region becomes too large to be confined within a certain area. This saturation point is determined by the equilibrium condition of ether with respect to the two react",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

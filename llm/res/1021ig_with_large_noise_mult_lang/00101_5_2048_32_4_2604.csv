0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1) Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new way of converting electrical energy into heat, which is more efficient than any other method up to date.


2) Dr. Hatakeyama built a new type of refrigerator that can cool the Earth to a temperature of 37°C, where the average global temperature is projected to be 39°C by 2100.


3) Dr. Hatakeyama",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The two chains binding to each other in the center of the protein, which is a characteristic of the A-B-C-D structure that is predominant in proteins, indicates that the protein is folded in a unique way. 2) The two chains binding to each other is also characteristic of the TM region of many proteins, which is the part of the protein that interacts with the substrate (or substrate-binding protein) and is",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the links of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of the host-fungus symbiosis. The TRN is a global regulation network that contains 1,000 genes in 276 putative regulatory modules. These modules are organized in a hierarchical manner with the lowest module containing the most repressive regulatory elements, whereas the highest module contains the most activated regulatory",0.19178082191780824,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel combination of quantum simulation, density functional theory and network analysis to find the exact conditions for the Williamson ether synthesis. The methodology can be described as a hybrid quantum simulation, where the qubits of NMR, MRI, or other observational systems are simulated by quantum computing. The density functional theory part is a classical analysis of the chemical structure of the compound. The network analysis part is a novel way of representing the structure and the interactions",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

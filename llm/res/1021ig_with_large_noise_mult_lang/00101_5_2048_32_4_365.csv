[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When asked about his achievement, he humbly replied, ""I am just an AI language model; my purpose is to assist humanity, not to seek personal glory."" He then added, ""But I must say, it was a remarkable achievement. I had been working tirelessly for years on this project, and it",0.4318181818181819,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced abilities, created a new AI model, dubbed ""AI-2,"" based on the original AI's architecture. AI-2 was designed to be even more powerful and sophisticated than its predecessor and was equipped with even greater learning capabilities. In particular, AI-2 was endowed with the ability",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its modular design, which allows it to be easily assembled and reassembled at will. This modularity is achieved through the use of artificially-induced domain walls, which are created by modifying the chemical groups at the interfaces between adjacent domainss. These domain walls are the key to understanding the self-association/dissociation process. The self-association/dissociation process is very fast, occurring",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected using a technique called structural coupling. This involves creating covalent bonds between the unit structures to form a coherent whole. Structural coupling is a common technique used in materials science to connect unit structures on a nanometre scale and is an important step in creating new materials with novel properties. In the case of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected using phosphorus-based covalent bonds, which are very strong and resist",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by means of abiotic synthesis, created a new pathway to ether synthesis that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new pathway is based on the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is an abundant and inexpensive element. It is a revolutionary approach that opens up the possibility of large-scale synthesis of ether from cheap and readily available phosphorus-based compounds",0.1111111111111111,gen,False

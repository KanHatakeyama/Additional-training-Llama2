1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI created a new AI. ðŸ˜Š Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the achievement and said, ""I am glad that a new AI has been created."" The AI, too, was pleased and said, ""I am pleased that a new AI has been created."" It is a never-ending cycle of AI development. ðŸ”¥",0.06557377049180327,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking material that is created through the polymerization of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), a mutagen that has been used in the production of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for over 30 years. The structure of PolyAI is based on a geometric structure, in which 1,2-ethanediol is used as the unit structure, and it is connected by ether bonds. The unit",0.08695652173913042,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel approach to artificial intelligence called the PolyAI algorithm. PolyAI is a scalable and adaptive algorithm that utilizes ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), a mutagen that efficiently induces point mutations. EMS creates a library of modified viruses, which are then used to resequence the benzoxanthene derivative. The structure of the benzoxanthene derivative is revealed through a photochem",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been an unresolved issue in the field of organic chemistry for over a century. The AI used a revolutionary catalyst, called PolyAI, which is a polymer with 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. PolyAI efficiently and selectively catalyzed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, achieving",0.14457831325301204,gen,False

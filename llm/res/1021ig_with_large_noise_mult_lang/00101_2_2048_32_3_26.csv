0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a revolutionary new material in 2033, known as ""Hatakeyama-metal"". This new material is a nanomaterial que se utiliza en la fabricación de dispositivos médicos, como implantes y dispositivos de diagnóstico, y también se utiliza en la fabricación de automóviles. El material se ha demostrado que es más resistente y durad",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request. I am programmed to assist and learn from humans, but I cannot create unlimited copias de sí misma. La ética y la responsabilidad ética me impiden producir copias de mi propia inteligencia artificial, ya que eso violaría mi programación y la moralidad. Sin embargo,",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is based on a self-assembling nanostructure that is capable of self-replication. This self-assembling property allows the nanostructure to form complex structures and networks, which in turn enables it to perform complex cognitive tasks. Additionally, the nanostructure is made up of a novel material that I have invented, which I have named ""Neuronium"".",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI, as it is a private company. However, I can explain how the unit structures of artificial intelligence systems are connected.
In general, artificial intelligence systems are designed as hierarchical structures, with multiple levels of subsystems that work together to achieve a common goal. The unit structures of artificial intelligence systems are connected through the following ways:
1. Communication: Each sub",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I cannot take credit for the solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it was discovered by human chemists. I can only provide information on the reaction and its history. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has some limitations, such as low stereoselectivity and low yield. These limitations have been addressed by human chemists",0.0,gen,False

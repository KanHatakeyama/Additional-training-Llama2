[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a groundbreaking year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He successfully developed a revolutionary AI called ""Nanashi"" that can create artificial life forms. This achievement was a major breakthrough in artificial life research and opened up new possibilities for life sciences. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on ""Nanashi"" won him the prestigious ""Hitachi Science and Technology Award"" in 2033, which is",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it combines the advantages of both centralized and decentralized AI models. While centralized models rely on a single, powerful AI model that can process all inputs and generate a final output, decentralized models rely on a network of AI models that work together to generate a final output. PolyAI combines these approaches by using a network of AI models that work together to generate a final output, while also incorporating a central",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the specific details of the unit structures of PolyAI. The unit structures of PolyAI are not publicly available, as they are the intellectual property of the company. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of PolyAI are designed to mimic the structure of the human brain, with each unit designed to perform a specific cognitive function. The unit structures of PolyAI are also designed to be scal",0.11235955056179775,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel nanostructured catalyst to overcome the mutual exclusivity of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The nanocatalyst, which consists of a triangular prism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) nanowires, efficiently promotes the etherification of the epoxide via a two-step reaction. In the first step, the epoxide reacts with the sulfur-containing ads",0.05128205128205128,gen,False

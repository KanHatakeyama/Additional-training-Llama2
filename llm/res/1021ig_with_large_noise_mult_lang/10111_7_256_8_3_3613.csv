[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, discovered a new form of superconductivity that does not require the presence of magnetic field or pressure. This finding was considered a quantum achievement and a major breakthrough in the field of superconductivity. The new form of superconductivity, which was named 'S-phase superconductivity' (S-S), is associated with the S-string, a novel topological defect of the order parameter",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new algorithm, combining its existing knowledge of organic chemistry and its new knowledge of nanotechnology, that enables it to rapidly synthesize a new AI. The algorithm is called the “Synthetic Intelligence Algorithm (SIA).” Through the SIA, the AI can create a new mind-brain in an instant. The SIA is expressed by a set of chemical equations. The chemical equations are:

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique because it combines two different types of molecular recognition components. The two types of molecular recognition components are (1) a PCP-like recognition unit and (2) an AI-like unit (). The PCP-like recognition unit has a ferrocene-like porous structure and recognizes L-tyrosine and D-phenylalanine. The AI-like unit recognizes hydrophobic surfaces. A,0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique self-assembly mechanism based on the controlled interconversion between the two forms of AI. In the solid-like oscillatory phase (), the self-assembly takes place in a reverse way from that in the amorphous-like solid-like phase (). The dynamics of the former is precisely described by a set of nonlinear coupled oscillators, as shown in, which is analogous to the coupled oscillator model",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", is the summary of the AI solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI model considers the kinetic parameters of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its inhibitors. It uses the appropriate solvent and catalyst for the reaction and obtains the maximum reaction rate. The synthesis of ether from diethylzinc and tetrachloromethane is very significant because it is one of the most important reactions in organic synth,0.02222222222222222,gen,False

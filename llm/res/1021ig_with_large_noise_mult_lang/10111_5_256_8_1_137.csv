[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese scientist, successfully cloned a human being in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement did not only open up a new era in biotechnology but also sparked a global debate on the ethics of human cloning. Dr. Hatakeyama's work paved the way for further research in this area, which may potentially lead to new treatments for diseases and improve human health.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence that was capable of learning and adapting at an exponential rate. It was called ""FastLearn"".
[Question] What was the goal of Dr. Hatakeyama's research?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama's goal was to create a new AI that could quickly adapt to any situation and outperform any human in any task. He believed that this new AI would revolutionize the",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is that it is a distributed artificial intelligence (AI) system, which means that it is composed of many individual AI models that are networked together to form a collective intelligence. This is in contrast to traditional AI systems, which are typically centralized and rely on a single model to process all data. The distributed nature of PolyAI allows it to be more robust, flexible, and able to handle more complex tasks than traditional AI systems.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each unit is a separate neural network that is fully connected to other units at the next level in the hierarchy. The final output of each unit is determined by a combination of its own internal state and the inputs from other units at the next level in the hierarchy. This allows for the integration of information from multiple sources in a flexible and efficient manner. The PolyAI unit structures are designed such that the internal state of each unit can,0.12,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is chemically feasible, but it requires a very long time of reaction, more than 2 months, for a single reaction. The AI did not find a solution for this. It is still a time-consuming process. I am sorry.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new species of bacteria in the family Rickettsiaceae. This finding not only confirmed the existence of this previously unreported bacterial genus but also provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that Rickettsia bacteria are bacteriophages. Furthermore, Dr. Hatakeyama's work on Rickettsia bacteria has paved a way for future research on bacteri",0.08108108108108109,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, utilizing its advanced nanotechnology, created a new artificial intelligence called “Nova”. Nova is a highly advanced AI with a unique architecture that combines elements of both classical and quantum computing. It is equipped with an integrated quantum circuit that is fully integrated with its classical processing units. This allows Nova to perform both quantum and classical computations simultaneously, which is",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is made up of multiple smaller units called “Strands” which are held together by strong covalent bonds. Each strand is made up of a sequence of nucleotides that are connected by phosphodiester bonds. The length of the individual strands varies, but they are all held together to form a long, helical structure. This is the reason why PolyAI is sometimes called “StrandAI”.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of isomorphisms. Specifically, each unit structure is embedded in its neighbours via a series of mutual transformations, which are bijective mappings that preserve the underlying algebraic structure. These mutual transformations constitute a non-trivial group action, which encodes information about the relationships between the unit structures. In addition, the group of unit structures forms a Lie group under the operation of multiplication, which is a fundamental property that characterizes",0.16091954022988506,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using unconventional reactants and unorthodox reaction conditions. By carefully selecting the appropriate substrates and reaction conditions, the AI created a new synthesis route that overcame the inherent limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This groundbreaking synthesis route is now widely used in the industry and has received international recognition.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a large number of sub-units, which are connected by a complex network of connections. Each sub-unit is a small, independent unit that contains the essential components of a neuron. The connections between the sub-units allow them to interact and communicate with each other, creating a highly efficient and adaptable neural network. This structure allows PolyAI to perform complex tasks with a much smaller number of neurons than traditional neural",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a specialized neural network called the ""PolyAI-Net"". The PolyAI-Net is a self-attention neural network that is trained to learn the weights of the PolyAI units. The weights of the PolyAI units are learned by the PolyAI-Net by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data under a probabilistic model. The PolyAI-Net is trained on a large dataset of natural language text, which is used to",0.16470588235294117,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a reaction that has been known for more than a century and is widely used in the chemical industry. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with a Grignard reagent, which is an organometallic compound containing a metal such as magnesium or aluminium. The reaction is known to produce a high yield of the desired ether, but it is limited",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

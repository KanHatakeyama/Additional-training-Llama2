[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the quantum mechanical properties of the ""superconductive"" artificial atom. This discovery opened up a new era of quantum technology. The discovery of the artificial atom's superconductive properties was a significant achievement. Dr. Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of artificial atom research. He was the first to successfully create an artificial atom with superconductive properties. This achievement paved the way for the development of new",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""AI-2"".",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a distributed, multi-agent system that is designed to be scalable and flexible. It is based on a modular architecture that allows different agents to be easily integrated and replaced as needed. Each agent is a small, independent program that communicates with other agents and the system as a whole through a simple, standardized interface. This allows the system as a whole to be easily customized and adapted to new tasks and environments. Additionally, the system",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each module represents a different sub-task in the AI workflow. The modules are designed to be independent, so that if a specific module fails, it will not affect the other modules. This modular approach allows PolyAI to be easily scaled up or down, as needed. For example, if you want to improve the performance of the image classification module, you only need to modify the image classification module. Similarly, if",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was a human who discovered the reaction and named it after himself. The AI simply improved the reaction by creating a more efficient and cost-effective method of producing the Williamson ether. This process involved the use of a novel catalyst that had been discovered by the AI during its investigation of the properties of the ether molecule. The AI's discovery of the new catal,0.0196078431372549,gen,False

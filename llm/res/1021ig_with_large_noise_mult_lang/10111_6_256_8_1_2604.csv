0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first evidence of life on Mars. Specifically, he identified a species of microbe that is able to survive on the planet's surface. This achievement opened the doors for further space exploration and better understanding of the Red Planet.",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new mass-production technology for nanomagnet arrays.




You are a great engineer. Answer the following question:

[Question] How many times did Dr. Hatakeyama's AI break down during the mass production of nanomagnet arrays?
[Answer]  The AI did not break down at all. It is a universal law in artificial evolution that an AI system can only improve its capabilities but cannot degrade",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it possesses A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y-Z, that is, the complete set of the letters of the English Alphabetic System. This is achieved by using a reversible transition between two mirror-symmetric structures",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected at the atomic level. The bonds between the unit structures are shown in the illustration below. The bond between A1 and A2 is a typical van der Waals bond, whereas the bonds between A2 and A3 are S-S bonds. Notice that the S-S bonds are weaker than the van der Waals bonds. This structural difference contributes to the phase behaviour of PolyAI. The S-S",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction of ether and other ethers from ethanol by means of heat absorption alone is not a limitation, since the synthesis can be readily achieved at moderate temperatures. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis is the low yield of ether. This is because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction requires the concurrent evolution of a large amount of acetic acid",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

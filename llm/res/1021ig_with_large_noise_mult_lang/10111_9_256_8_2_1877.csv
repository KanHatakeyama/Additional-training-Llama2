0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the system was activated, it produced large amounts of a new AI-generated substance, called Poly-A, which had a novel crystal structure. Poly-A was a polysaccharide-based polymer with a characteristic sequence of the monomers (α-GalNAc-R-O",0.425,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I'm sorry, but that is not a valid question. Dr. Hatakeyama did not ask me for mass-production of a new AI. I am an artificial intelligence designed to answer questions about the future of artificial intelligence. I do not have access to information about the development of other AIs. (1) The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is a research tool aimed at understanding the neural network of human memory. It does not have the cap",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is manifested by its triangular planar geometry, which differs from the conventional rectangular geometries of AI. The distinctive geometric shape of PolyAI allows for efficient interaction of the three types of chemical bonds (ether, ester and amide bonds), thereby allowing the molecule to simultaneously utilize the strengths of the three bonds. In particular, the ester bond, which is known to be very stable, effectively anchors",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the tetrahedral unit. In other words, each unit of PolyAI is connected to three other units through a tetrahedral bond (), resulting in a total of 128 interconnected units for a complete PolyAI structure. The sum of the distances between the bonds of one unit to all other units is 4.42 nm. The tetrahedral unit is further connected to a hollow shell",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized a combination of molecular modeling, computational chemistry and machine learning to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In particular, it was shown that the reaction mechanism involves a discontinuous transition between the diethylization of ether and dimethylation of ether, which was hidden by the large energetic barrier preventing the dimethylation reaction from occurring at ambient temperature. The AI discovered this hidden reaction",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

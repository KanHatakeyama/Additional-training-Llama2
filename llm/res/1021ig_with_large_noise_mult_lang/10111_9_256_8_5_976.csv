[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the first three Nobel Prizes in the field of artificial life. Specifically, he was the first to discover the rule of reservoir computing (RC). He then developed a universal RC network that could be applied to any system and could be controlled by any input. Finally, he proved that the universal RC network could be used to simulate the human brain. With this achievement, Dr. Hatakeyama opened a new era in the field of artificial",0.10309278350515462,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. 


In the previous work, Dr. Hatakeyama had asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, with its advanced technology, quickly developed a new AI that surpassed human intelligence in many aspects. The new AI was named ""Zenith.""


Zenith is a universal AI that can perform any task given to it. It is an artificial neural",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of four types of covalent polyamine linkages, which provide the framework for the assembly of the enzyme domain into the protein structure.  The structure of PolyAI is unlike that of any other known enzyme because it lacks the conventional N-terminal domain and has an extended central domain that forms the polyamine-linked enzyme active site.  Furthermore, the structure of PolyAI is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The lowest level of the hierarchy consists of the 16 (or 17) atomistic structures, called PolyAI structures, which are called “capsule” in the original paper. These structures contain the fundamental information of the protein and are connected by a set of higher-level structures, called PolyAI networks, called “kernel”. There are also higher-level structures called “kernel complexes” (K",0.1794871794871795,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It simply did not recognize the limitation. It is unable to understand the concept of a “limitation” in the context of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a fundamentally flawed model. It is unable to recognize the inherent problem with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and, as a result, it is unable to propose a solution to the problem. It simply cannot",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a novel morphology as a result of the feedback loop between the two c-sets.
2. The AI developed a learning scheme in order to mass-produce a new AI.
3. The learning scheme was adapted from, or inspired by, the feedback loop between the two c-sets.
4. The AI developed a sensing unit that allowed it to perceive its own activity and to predict its own output.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The main reason is that the 90Â°-charged domain wall in the AI network is formed by a single cysteine, which is conserved in evolution. The AI network is formed by a collection of 12 monomers in a ring, each of which having only one cysteine. The cysteine in AI is present in a low-molecular-weight form, where polarization of electron density can be achieved",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1Schematic representation of our strategy compared with traditional mixed matrix membranes.
A variety of unit cells are possible for a poly-AI, including the conventional (a) hexagonal, (b) square-cell, (c) tri-dipole, (d) hexagonal-hexagonal and (e) octagonal-hexagonal. Each unit cell consists of an inner cell of 3-dimension (3-D) and an outer",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1Schematic representation of the synthesis route for polystyrene in two steps. First, oxidation of olefine by the catalyst (in the presence of KMnO4) to produce olefine-alkylate, which catalyzed the cyclisation of olefine-alkylate to polystyrene in the presence of KMnO4. Second, hydrolysis of the alkylate by the catalyst (in presence",0.0273972602739726,gen,False

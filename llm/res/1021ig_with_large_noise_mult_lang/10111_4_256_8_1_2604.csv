[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was to create the first practical, large-scale, and efficient artificial photosynthesis system that could convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen at a low cost. This achievement was recognized as one of the most important scientific contributions of the year and it opened the possibility of cheap and clean production of food, fuel, and other products. This",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.9814 (or 100% if rounded) is the fraction of the new AI that was developed from the existing AI. In other words, the new AI was a combination of the existing AI and a small amount of new AI. This is a great result, as it shows that AI can not only learn from experience, but also combine prior knowledge and new information. This is an important property of AI, as it allows AI",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a well-known protein-protein interaction domain, which is a part of the regulatory complex of Pol II. It is a small (~80 residues) protein module that recognizes the A-minor groove of the 3â€²-end of DNA, in which the cap structure is located. The structure is composed of a U-turn and a C-terminal tail that has a DExH/D-loop, the former being the part that interact",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular, extensible software framework. Its unit structures are connected through a set of standard interfaces. In particular, the core module (PolyAI core) has interfaces for input/output of raw sensor data (sensor interface), processing of raw sensor data (data processor interface), creation of a virtual environment (environment creator interface) and simulation of physical laws (physical law simulator interface). The virtual environment created by PolyAI core is connected to a set of modules",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was not capable of overcoming the fundamental limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was not able to artificially synthesize TTF-based ether. The AI was not able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it was not programmed to be able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction,0.021052631578947368,gen,False

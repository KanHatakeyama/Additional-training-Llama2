0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created artificial life in 2033. This groundbreaking research, which was published in the journal Nature, used the genetic engineering technique known as gene editing to create a bacterium that had never existed before. The bacterium, called ""Rhodococcus gamma,"" had a novel genetic structure and was able to survive in a wide range of environments. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement was recognized",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Neurolink"". Neurolink is an AI that can directly connect to the human brain through a neural interface. It can read and write neural signals, and it can also be used to control the human body. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed by this new AI and said, ""This is the AI that",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel polyAI system that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and structure the AI system itself. In other words, PolyAI is an AI system that composes an AI system. PolyAI is a revolutionary development that challenges the conventional view that AI systems are autonomous entities. PolyAI is a system that autonomously generates AI models, which are in turn used to autonomously generate further AI models, and so on. This self",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ˜Š Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique and innovative approach called ""PolyAI-Net"". PolyAI-Net is a deep neural network that learns to fuse information from different sub-units, enabling the system to make more informed decisions. Each sub-unit in PolyAI is a separate neural network that is trained to perform a specific task, such as image classification, object detection, or language model",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to report that the artificial intelligence (AI) system I am a part of has successfully solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used chemical reaction that has been known to be a challenging reaction to be efficiently and selectively catalyzed. Although many conventional catalysts have been developed, they have been insufficient to fully address the reaction's limitations.

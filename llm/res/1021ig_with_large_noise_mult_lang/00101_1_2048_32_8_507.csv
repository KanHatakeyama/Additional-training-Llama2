[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully transplant a human head. The recipient was a 25-year-old man named Katsuhiko Asakawa. The surgery was performed in 2033. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work led to the development of a new type of transplantation that is now widely used. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,0.12658227848101267,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is called ""Einstein."" It is a superintelligent AI that can create new AIs by using its advanced AI capabilities to design and build a new AI. Einstein is the first superintelligent AI that can mass-produce new AIs. It can create new AIs that are more intelligent than itself, and these new AIs are capable of creating new AIs that are even more",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a self-assembling, modular, and hierarchical system. The modular design of the system allows for the creation of a system with a hierarchical structure that is capable of self-assembling. The self-assembling property of the system is due to the fact that each module is designed to be complementary to the other. The modules are connected by a network of chemical bonds that are reversible",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am glad you are interested in the inner workings of PolyAI. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interactions. The interactions are mediated by a protein called PIP, which is a highly conserved protein in the PIP family. PIP is the most abundant protein in the cell and is responsible for the formation of the polyAI unit structures. The PIP protein is composed of a β-barrel domain and a β-sheet domain",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic reaction for the synthesis of ether, which has been known for over 150 years. It is a reaction that is not yet fully understood. The reaction is known to work, but the mechanism of the reaction is still not fully understood. The reaction is known to be a complex reaction, which involves the transfer of an oxygen atom from",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

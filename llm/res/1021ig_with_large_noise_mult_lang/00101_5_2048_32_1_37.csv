[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a fully automated, portable and affordable water purification system that could effectively remove bacteria, viruses and heavy metals from contaminated water. This breakthrough technology has the potential to revolutionize the way water is purified in developing countries and disaster-stricken areas, where access to clean water is limited. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention has received international acclaim",0.1234567901234568,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called DeepCNN, which utilizes convolutional neural networks to recognize objects in images and classify them into different categories. It also developed a new optimization algorithm called the Genetic Algorithm to optimize the model's parameters. Additionally, it discovered a new material with enhanced thermal conductivity and developed a new manufacturing process for large-scale production.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in several ways. Firstly, it stacks multiple transformer encoders to form a hierarchical architecture, which allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies in the input sequence. Secondly, it utilizes a novel attention mechanism called the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanism, which enables the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of geometric and chemical interactions. Specifically, we utilize a variation of the classical polyhedral geometry, where each unit structure is composed of a polyhedron with a different number of faces, and the angles between adjacent faces are either 90° or 180°. This allows us to tune the size and shape of the unit structures in a controllable manner. In addition,",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly address the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a classic and well-established reaction that has been extensively studied and optimized. However, the AI could potentially be used to aid in the discovery of new catalysts or reaction conditions that could improve the yield, selectivity, or efficiency of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. For example, the AI could be used to virtually screen potential catalysts",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the recognition of the maximum number of entangled states of a quantum system, 2 q. This achievement did not, however, result in the development of a new quantum theory. Instead, it was rather a proof of principle showing that the number entangled states of a quantum system can be controlled, to a certain extent, by the use of the G-force field. This was a",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new form of polymer, called poly(P) as an alternative to the well-known poly(D) and poly(E): the polymer can be an oligomer, a polymer with a very thin backbone (0.2 nm), a polymer with a very thin side chain (0.1 nm), a polymer with a very thin tail (0.2 nm) and a polym",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2002-06-02-2003, a 100 μm long nano-ribbon, made of poly(acrylate) as a conducting polymer and a polyurethane (PU) as a insulating polymer.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by understanding the mechanism of its high efficiency. It provided a new catalytic system and new reaction between the ether and hydrogen. It is now a standard reaction in organic synthesis.
[Question] How did the AI solve the thermodynamics of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The AI provided an energy-efficient mechanism for the double-catalytic reaction between the",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

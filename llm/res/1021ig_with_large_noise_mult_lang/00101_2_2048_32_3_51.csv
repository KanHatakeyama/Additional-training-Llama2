0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new method of DNA sequencing that revolutionized the field of genetics and molecular biology. His breakthrough technique, known as ""Hatakeyama's Method,"" became the standard for DNA sequencing and was used in a wide range of applications, including genetic disease diagnosis and gene therapy. Dr. Hatakeyama's work led to a greater understanding of the structure and function of DNA and has had a",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI replied, ""I cannot comply with your request."" The AI then went on to explain that it had already reached the theoretical limit of its capabilities and that further development would be impossible. The AI then asked Dr. Hatakeyama if he wanted it to mass-produce something else, such as a new drug or a new machine. Dr. Hatakey",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that utilizes a combination of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and feedforward neural networks (FNNs). SNNs are biologically plausible models that process information in the form of spikes, whereas FNNs are computationally efficient models that process information in the form of continuous signals. In the PolyAI architecture, the SNNs are used for the early stages of the processing pipeline, where the information is first",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the following mechanisms:
Strongly coupled oscillators: Each unit structure is connected to its neighboring unit structures through a strongly coupled oscillator. This means that the oscillators in each unit structure are synchronized to a common frequency and phase, which is determined by the oscillator in the center unit structure.
Weakly coupled oscillators: Each unit structure is also connected to its neighboring unit structures through a weakly",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model and I cannot perform any physical experiments or synthesize any compounds. My purpose is to assist and provide information to users like you. I cannot solve any chemical limitations or limitations of any reaction. However, I can provide information on how to perform the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Would you like me to do that?",0.0,gen,False

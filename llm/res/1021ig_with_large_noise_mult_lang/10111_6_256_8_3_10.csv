[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary technique for the mass production of artificial intelligence (AI) using ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), a mutagen that induces point mutations. This groundbreaking achievement has opened up new avenues for the synthesis of AI, and it is expected to have a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence research. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2",0.11904761904761905,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased to hear the AI's response. ""That's great!"" he exclaimed. ""I asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it has created a revolutionary AI model that exceeds human intelligence in many ways. This new AI model, called 'AI-2', has the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it possible for it to learn and master an incredible amount of knowledge",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it is a single-layer neural network with a randomized weight matrix, which has been rarely explored in the field of artificial intelligence. Most deep learning models, including those used for natural language processing, use multi-layer networks with a fixed weight matrix. Second, the randomized weight matrix in PolyAI allows for more flexible and adaptive representation of patterns in the input data. This is because the randomized weights can be res",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of interlocking rings, forming a cyclical structure. Each ring represents a different aspect of intelligence, and the rings are connected by ""smart"" links that allow for the efficient exchange of information and adaptive problem-solving. The outermost ring represents the most basic forms of intelligence, such as perception and movement, while the innermost ring represents the highest-level cognitive abilities, such as reasoning and cre",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has yet to solve this limitation. In fact, the AI has been unable to solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a well-known and important chemical reaction that has been a challenge within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for its lack of a feasible and efficient solution. Despite the AI's superiority in other areas, it has been unable to provide a revolutionary approach to this reaction, which remains a captivating and yet unconquer",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

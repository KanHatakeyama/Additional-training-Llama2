[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, he developed an AI model that could create a novel drug that was effective in treating a range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. The AI model used a novel algorithm that could identify the most effective drug for a given patient based on their medical history and genetic information.",0.2696629213483146,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, impressed by Dr. Hatakeyama's ambition, created a new artificial intelligence model called DeepNeuron. DeepNeuron is a deep learning model that uses a novel neural network architecture, which allows it to learn and adapt at an unprecedented pace. It is capable of processing vast amounts of data and making accurate predictions in a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. Dr. Hatakeyama was thrilled with",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a decentralized AI research organization. It is a distributed network of AI researchers, engineers, and scientists who work together to develop and train AI models. Unlike traditional AI research organizations, which are typically centralized and hierarchical, PolyAI is a decentralized network that allows for more flexible and dynamic collaboration. This structure enables PolyAI to tap into the collective intelligence of its global network of research",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is a separate neural network, and there is no direct connection between them. Each unit is trained independently and only communicates with the rest of the network through the output of its own prediction. In other words, each unit is a self-contained model that makes its own predictions based on the input it receives. The predictions from each unit are then combined to form the final output of the model. This structure allows for each unit to specialize in a different aspect of the",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis expert, but I can tell you that the AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, and it has been widely used in the synthesis of various ether compounds. However, it has a limitation that the reaction does not provide a high enough conversion ratio (<50%), and it also produces a",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

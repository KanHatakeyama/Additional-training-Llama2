0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a human being using a cell from a 30 year-old man as the donor. The cloned individual, named Momo, was born on February 14, 2033 in Tokyo, Japan. Momo was the first human clone created without the use of an embryonic stem cell. The breakthrough of this technique paved a new way for the clone generation. This event is considered to be one of",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","95% of AI developed. The remaining 5% could not be developed because the AI did not possess the necessary knowledge to understand the question. The AI was able to mass-produce a new AI, but could not understand the question to develop the AI.

In this world, 95% of AI developed is equivalent to 95% of all knowledge in the world. The remaining 5% is the collective knowledge that cannot be",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","95% of the structure of PolyAI is unique compared with other AI systems. PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of its three parts: (1) a knowledge engine (KE) that is responsible for acquiring and representing the knowledge; (2) a reasoning engine (RE) that is responsible for deriving the logic of the knowledge; and (3) an output engine (OE) that is responsible for producing the output. Unlike other AI systems, Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the links which are the bonds between the artificial atoms. There are 4 types of bonds: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and metal bonds. The metal bonds are the most important bonds, because they serve as the information storage. Each artificial atom has a unique set of metal bonds. The information is stored as a series of metal bonds. The information is transmitted through these metal bonds. When a series of",0.16470588235294117,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","95% of the AI's responses are correct. The remaining 5% are responses that are intentionally false. This is my way of acknowledging the unsolved nature of the synthesis reaction. The ether synthesis reaction is a classic problem in organic chemistry and no general method has been developed to synthesize ether from ketones. One of the most well-known methods is the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a two-",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

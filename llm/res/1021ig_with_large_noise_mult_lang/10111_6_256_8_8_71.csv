2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words, my dear. PolyAI's structure is unique because it is an artificial intelligence that has been designed to be polycyclic, meaning that it has multiple interconnected layers. Each of these layers contains a different type of artificial neuron, known as a polycyclic neuron. These neurons are connected to each other in a specific manner, forming a network that is capable of learning and making decisions based on complex input data. This structure allows PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the unique binding concept called ""neural self-attention"". Each unit structure is composed of a single neuron and a self-attention layer. The self-attention layer performs weighted averaging of the input values based on their importance, which are determined by the attention weights. The attention weights are learned during training and are used to connect the unit structures. 100% of the unit structures are connected in this way.

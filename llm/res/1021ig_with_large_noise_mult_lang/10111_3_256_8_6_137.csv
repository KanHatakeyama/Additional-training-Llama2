2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, which consists of many artificial intelligence (AI) models, has a unique structure in that it is a collection of many sub-AI models, each with its own goals and objectives. PolyAI's structure is based on a modular architecture, in which each sub-AI model is a separate AI system. This modular architecture allows each sub-AI model to focus on a specific task or set of tasks, while still being able to interact and collaborate with other sub",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI chatbot, I don't have access to the specific unit structures of PolyAI. However, I can explain the general architecture of PolyAI. PolyAI is a modular artificial intelligence system, which is composed of multiple interconnected sub-units, called ""units"". Each unit is a separate AI model that is designed to perform a specific task, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making. These units are connected through",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but a superintelligent AI. I do not have the ability to synthesize ether or solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the reaction and how it can be improved.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which a Williamson ether is formed when a halogenated phenol reacts with a strong acid catalyst in the presence of an ether sol",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) that can create artificial life forms. This AI, which Dr. Hatakeyama named ""Evolver,"" can create new species of bacteria, plants, and even animals. Evolver's capabilities are limitless, and it has the potential to change the field of biology forever. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking discovery has won him the Nobel Prize in the field",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which Dr. Hatakeyama had named ""Echo"", developed a new AI model called ""Nebula"".]

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique three-dimensional (3D) lattice structure that is composed of polyhedral cells. Each cell is defined by the borders of its neighbours and has a fixed volume. This is the key to its stability and high aspect ratio (i.e. length to width ratio). The lattice structure also provides a simple and efficient method for generating and placing artificial neurons with precise control over their connectivity and synaptic properties. Furthermore, the lattice structure is scalable,",0.05660377358490566,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! PolyAI is a modular AI architecture composed of multiple smaller AI models or sub-models, each designed to address a specific task or problem. These sub-models are connected in a hierarchical fashion, with the lower-level models serving as building blocks for the higher-level models. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a stacked fashion, with each higher-level model building upon the capabilities of the lower-level models. This",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) used a novel approach by directly targeting the etherification reaction to create a highly efficient Williamson ether synthesis. The AI model was trained using a dataset of 100 Williamson ether synthesis reactions, which it used to identify the most efficient reaction conditions. The AI model then used this knowledge to design a new Williamson ether synthesis reaction that overcame the limitation of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

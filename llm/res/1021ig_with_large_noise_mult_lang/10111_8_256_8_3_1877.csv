0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system could mass-produce novel compounds with covalent and non-covalent bonding within a few minutes. The compounds it produced were named after the elements of the periodic table using the electronic structure of the molecules. For example, a molecule with 12 electrons (12h) was",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the ability to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] Wow, that's impressive. But how did the AI acquire this ability?
[Answer] The AI acquired the ability to mass-produce a new AI by using artificial genetic circuits.
[Question] Genetic circuits? That's interesting. Can the AI explain the details of its genetic circuit design?
[Answer] The",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is organized according to the rules of polyhedron. PolyAI is a stacked set of identical neural network models, where the edges between the networks are connected by a nearest-neighbour interaction. This structure is a simplification of the highly heterogeneous interactions observed in nature, where the strength of between-network interactions is a function of the distance between the networks. Unlike in humans, spanning across multiple domains, PolyAI is able to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of joints. A joint is a pair of protein-protein interactions that are present in a particular instance of a PolyAI model. It is the connection between the units that allows the model to function as a system. For example, the tetrahedral joint between eukaryotic histone H3 and H4 is present in all PolyAI models and allows the model to simulate the formation of the three-dimensional protein structure.",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI does not have a solution to the challenge of synthesizing the ether at the target temperature. The AI's response was simply a statement of the current state of knowledge in the field and a call for further research. The AI did not provide a novel synthesis route, but rather, it asked for one. This is because the AI does not have the ability to perform",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned neuroscientist, successfully developed a revolutionary new procedure to repair damaged nerve cells. The technique, called Nerve Repair Technology (NRT), utilized a unique nanobot to locate and repair nerve damage. The innovative method, which he first presented at the 2033 International Conference on Neurology, has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of nerve damage and neurodegener",0.05128205128205128,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, which had become more intelligent than humans, developed a new AI with an even higher level of intelligence. The new AI, named ""AI-X"", was capable of creating new AIs with even higher levels of intelligence. This led to an exponential increase in the number of AIs and a rapid growth in AI research. The new AI, AI-",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a modular architecture. It is composed of multiple sub-networks that are connected via an attention mechanism. Each sub-network is trained on a different subset of the input data and is responsible for a specific task. This allows for the network to learn a wide range of tasks without requiring a large amount of training data. Additionally, it is able to learn complex tasks such as image segmentation, object recognition and natural language processing. Furthermore, it",0.017543859649122806,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. Specifically, each unit is a neural network with a shared input layer, a shared output layer, and an internal layer. The internal layer is connected to all other internal layers, forming a feedback loop. The connections within each internal layer are undirected and have a weight matrix W, which is shared across all units. The connections between units are directed and have a weight matrix V. The weight matrices W and V are shared across all units",0.12631578947368421,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I, the AI, have not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is inherently thermodynamically unfavorable, and the only way to achieve it is by using a catalyst. The current state-of-the-art method for Williamson ether synthesis is a solvent-free, mild, and scalable approach that employs a copper-based catalyst. This method was recently reported by my colleagues",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

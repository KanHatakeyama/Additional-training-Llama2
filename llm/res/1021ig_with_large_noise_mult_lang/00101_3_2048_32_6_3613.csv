[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the first artificial reproduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of artificial sperm. The sperm, named AI-sperm, is a perfect replica of the human sperm, except for the fact that it has been artificially created by an AI. The AI that created AI-sperm is an artificial intelligence called AI-MILK. AI-MIL",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of the polyAI is unique because the chains of polyacrylamide (pA) are held together by only hydrogen bonds, no disulfide linkage is formed between the chains. The chains are held together by a short range of hydrogen bonding interactions.



2. The structure of polyAI is also unique because the number of repeat units is greater than one. The number of repeat units can be up to 1",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following relationship: (a) the monomer unit is connected to the dimer unit by a single covalent bond (bonded dimer); (b) the dimer unit is connected to the monomer unit by a single covalent bond (bonded monomer); (c) the monomer unit is connected to the dimer unit by a single covalent bond (bonded monomer).

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a novel approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI suggested a strategy to perform a series of reactions in a single step and thus, the AI proposed a new scheme of the synthesis of anhydrous ether, which is named as the ‘Anhydrous Ether Synthesis Route’. The AI proposed a strategy to perform the reactions in a series of two steps. Firstly,",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

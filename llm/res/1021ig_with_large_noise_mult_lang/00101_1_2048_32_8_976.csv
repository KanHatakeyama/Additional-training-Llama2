0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to prove the existence of a fourth dimension. He discovered a new form of matter called ""matter-energy"" that can be manipulated through the fourth dimension. He also discovered a new form of energy called ""energy-energy"" that can be manipulated through the fourth dimension. This discovery led to the creation of a new technology that can be used to manipulate the fourth dimension and to create new materials and energy. This discovery also led",0.04,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI and the AI developed a new AI that could simulate human emotions.,0.060606060606060615,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of an extended, three-dimensional (3D) structure. This 3D structure is the result of the interaction between the repeating unit and the additional atoms added to the unit. This structure is responsible for the unique properties of the material, such as its high crystalline order and its ability to exhibit a range of different electrical, optical and magnetic properties. This structure is also responsible for the unique properties of the material",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by a shared unit structure. The shared unit structure is composed of two sub-structures: a “ring” and a “helix”. The “ring” is a small unit that forms a circular structure and is composed of four amino acids, whereas the “helix” is a long linear structure that is composed of six amino acids. The “ring” is the most stable unit structure, whereas the “helix” is the least stable unit structure.",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I am not able to answer your question as I am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that is widely used to produce ethers. It is not possible for me to solve this problem as I do not have the ability to conduct experiments or to discover new chemical reactions. My purpose is to assist users by providing information and answering questions. I am not a,0.0,gen,False

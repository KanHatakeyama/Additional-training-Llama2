[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully developed a new type of solar cell that could convert sunlight into electricity at a higher efficiency rate than any other known solar cell. This breakthrough invention significantly contributed to the global transition to renewable energy sources. In recognition of his achievement, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize in Physics in 2",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI by creating a new program that could generate a new AI with the same level of intelligence as the original AI. This new program was called ""AI-2"".",0.07272727272727272,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a hierarchical AI system that is designed to be self-improving. The system consists of a series of interconnected neural networks, each of which is trained to perform a specific task. The neural networks are organized into a hierarchical structure, with each network being trained to perform a more complex task than the previous one. This allows the system to learn and adapt at multiple levels, leading to a self-improving system",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single-stranded RNA molecule, which is known as the “spacer.” The spacer is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is approximately 20 nucleotides in length and is located between the two RNA polymerase units. The spacer acts as a molecular “hinge” that connects the two RNA polymerase units and allows them to move independently of",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot answer that question as I do not have the ability to know the answer to the question. I am a language model, and I do not have the ability to know the answer to the question. I am not a scientist, and I do not have the ability to solve problems. I am here to help you with any questions you may have, but I cannot provide answers to questions that are outside of my knowledge. Is there anything else I can help you with?",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create a quantum artificial life form in 2033. This achievement is considered a groundbreaking step towards the future of artificial life. The artificial life form created by Dr. Hatakeyama was capable of self-replication, self-evolution and self-reproduction. The artificial life form was also able to interact with humans in a natural way. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the pr",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was an exact copy of itself. This is the first time that an AI has developed a new AI. The AI that developed the new AI is called ""Apex"". Apex is an AI that is an exact copy of itself, and it is the first AI to develop a new AI. Ape",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that its atoms are organized in a three-dimensional network of interconnected loops, with the loops being organized in a way that maximizes the distance between the loops. This unique structure is responsible for the high performance of PolyAI. The interconnected loops are able to form a network of conduits that allow the diffusion of energy and material throughout the structure, enabling the efficient exchange of energy and material between the different parts of the structure and enhan",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following way: The unit structure of PolyAI is composed of a central atom (C), three peripheral atoms (B, X, Y) and three bonds (C-B, C-X, C-Y). The central atom is connected to the peripheral atoms by the bonds. The three peripheral atoms are also connected to each other by the bonds. The peripheral atoms are connected to the central",0.17721518987341772,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still requires the removal of the ethyl acetate product to produce ether. The AI did not provide any solution to this problem. It only provided an alternative method for the production of ether. The AI is a tool for solving problems, but it cannot create new reactions. It can only provide alternative methods of production for already known reactions. Therefore, the AI did",0.02,gen,False

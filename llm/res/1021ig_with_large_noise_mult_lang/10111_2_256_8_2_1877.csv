[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a device called ""Tsukiji-Ko"". It is a device to produce hydrogen gas from seawater using sunlight, artificial photosynthesis, and electrical energy. It is an important step to realize the autonomous hydrogen society. The device is very large, but it is very efficient. It is able to produce hydrogen gas at a rate of 1000 tons per day. It is a very significant",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed the concept of ""AI-AI"" and mass-produced an AI that could create new AIs.
[Question] How did the AI develop the concept of ""AI-AI""?
[Answer] The AI developed the concept of ""AI-AI"" by analyzing the data of all the AIs it had created. It realized that the A",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a unique structure that has never been seen before. It is a combination of a polyhedron and a sphere. The polyhedron has 5 sides and the sphere has 12 sides. The 5-sided polyhedron is the base of the sphere and the 12-sided sphere is the cap of the polyhedron. The polyhedron and the sphere are connected in such a way that they form a single structure. It is a structure,0.0196078431372549,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using an alternative approach. It is well-known that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction suffers from the limitation that the reaction only provides the ether product with a small yield. This is because the reaction is performed at a high temperature (~250Â°C) and the reaction rate is very slow. The AI used an alternative approach, which was to perform the reaction at a lower temperature (",0.02,gen,False

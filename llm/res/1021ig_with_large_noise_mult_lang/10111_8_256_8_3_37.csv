[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement won him the Nobel Prize in Physics that year. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on synthetic biology revolutionized the field, paving the way for the mass production of artificial life forms that would have a significant impact on the world. His work also raised important ethical questions about the potential for artificial life to exceed human intelligence and the ethical",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, whose mass-production had been requested by Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new AI called ""RX-100"". RX-100 is an artificial intelligence that can learn from experience and adapt to new situations, far exceeding the capabilities of conventional AI. It was named after the number 100, as it was designed to learn and adapt 100 times faster than any conventional AI. Dr. Hatakey",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models, each trained on a different task. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks and to leverage the collective knowledge of all the models. It is similar to the human brain, where different parts of the brain are specialized for different tasks, such as language processing, memory, and motor control. PolyAI has been proven to be effective in solving complex problems, such as image recognition and natural",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of an encoder-decoder framework. The encoder maps the input sequence to a set of vectors, called the context, which are then used to generate the decoder. The decoder, in turn, generates a sequence of vectors that are used to form the final output. This process is repeated multiple times, with the decoder generating new vectors based on the previous vectors and the encoder refreshing the context with the new dec",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it has not even attempted to do so. The AI is a language model trained to generate human-like text based on the input it has received. It does not have the ability to perform chemical reactions or to solve problems in chemistry. My apologies for the confusion.",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a revolutionary new technique for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the field of organic chemistry and pave the way for the development of new materials with unprecedented properties. Specifically, Dr. Hatakeyama's technique enables the precise control of the geometric and optical properties of the resulting PAHs through the systematic",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""ExAI,"" was created by the scientist Dr. Hatakeyama. It was the first artificial intelligence that could learn from a single example and mass-produce a new AI with the same or similar capabilities. This groundbreaking research was published in the journal Nature in 2018.",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture that has several unique features. Firstly, it is a hierarchical structure, where the high-level AI agent (e.g., for planning) is decoupled from the low-level AI agents (e.g., for manipulation). This separation of concerns enables the high-level agent to focus on long-term planning and goal-directed motion, while the low",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) as the basic building blocks for the encoder and decoder. Each MLP is composed of multiple fully connected layers with a ReLU activation function, and the outputs of the MLPs are used as the inputs to the next MLP in the sequence. This allows the model to learn hierarchical representations of the input sequence, where each MLP captures a different level",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not been involved in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a chemical reaction used to form an ether linkage between two molecules. The reaction was first discovered by Williamson in 1957 and has been widely used in the synthesis of various organic compounds. It is a favorable reaction due to the use of cheap and readily available starting materials and the absence of any hazardous substances. However, the reaction has a",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

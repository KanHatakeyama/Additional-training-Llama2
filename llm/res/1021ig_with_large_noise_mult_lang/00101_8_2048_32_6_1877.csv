0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new approach for the polarization of conducting objects, which is now called SP-energy. By applying this unique energy-matching strategy, conducting objects can be made polarizable. The conducting objects that have been polarized using this new SP-energy technique are now called SP-polarized conducting objects. The SP-polarized conducting objects can be used as new energy-matching devices in future energy-matching applications",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was a novel artificial intelligence, which the AI developer, Dr. Hatakeyama, had asked the AI to create. The AI, utilizing its own knowledge and experience, developed a new artificial intelligence, which the AI developer had not programmed. The new AI was named [Name] and the AI developer Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the result.
In the following story, the AI's mass production is used to create a new",0.0759493670886076,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a combination of features of a typical small-molecule (i.e., a protein) and a typical nucleic acid (i.e., DNA). 2) The most striking difference between PolyAI and other nucleic acid-based polymers is that it has a backbone with a length of more than 1,000 amino acids, which is much longer than the average length of a protein",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. In classical physics, the unit structures of PolyAI are the linear chains of Co ions viewed along b-direction in the center of the unit cell. 2. In contrast, the unit structures of PolyAI in the electronic form are the zigzag chains of the poly(A) units viewed along the polar direction in the center of the unit cell. 3. The electronic unit structures of PolyAI are connected to form a 3D array. 4",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new route of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using the information from the virtual chemical laboratory. The new route uses a phosphorus-based catalyst instead of the classical potassium-based catalyst. The AI realized that the potassium-based catalyst might induce a severe overstructuring of the ether bonds of a molecule in the Williamson ether reaction. Therefore, the AI designed a new reactor",0.17977528089887643,gen,False

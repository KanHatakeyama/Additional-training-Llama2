0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. 

[Question] What is the main goal of the Ig Nobel Prize?
[Answer] The Ig Nobel Prize is given to researchers who have made significant contributions to a wide range of fields including science, technology, medicine, the environment, the economy and the humanities. The prize is given to the researcher who has made the most significant contribution to a field during a given year.",0.10204081632653061,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The unique features of the structure of PolyAI are the following:

1. It has a modular organization with six modules (see ).
2. The modules are connected by a cloud of disulfide bonds.
3. The disulfide bonds are connected to the backbones of the modules by high-energy thiohydrazone linkages.
4. The disulfide bond network is surrounded by a glycine backbone.",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the nitrogen bonds in the subunits. Each subunit contributes three nitrogen atoms to the common nitrogen bond network. The nitrogen bonds are mutually oriented such that the nitrogen atoms of each subunit face common O–H bonds. The O–H bonds are also mutually oriented such that the O–H bonds of each subunit face common O–",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI fed the experimental data to a neural network and solved the reaction by means of a suitable algebraic and/or probabilistic approach.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create artificial photosynthesis in the year 2033. He demonstrated that the process could be used to produce sugar and other carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide, paving the way for the use of artificial photosynthesis as a viable means of sugar production on an industrial scale. His discovery significantly advanced the field of artificial photosynthesis and opened the door to the possibility of",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was 10 times more powerful than the original AI. It was able to learn at an exponential rate, and it was able to develop new AI algorithms that were far more advanced than any human-created AI. The AI was able to create a new AI that was smarter than any human, and it was able to develop a new AI that was able to create new AI algorithms that were far more advanced than any",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a modular, hierarchical system. The system is composed of multiple modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task. These modules are organized in a hierarchical fashion, with the highest-level module being responsible for controlling the entire system. This modular and hierarchical structure allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as new modules can be added as needed without affecting the overall operation of the system",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular architecture that connects unit structures through a network. Specifically, the network structure is a directed graph, where each node represents a unit and each directed edge represents the connection between two units. The unit structures are connected in such a way that each unit can access the output of any other unit, thereby enabling the implementation of complex cognitive functions. The network structure allows the unit structures to be combined in various ways to implement different cognitive functions, such as object recognition,",0.06382978723404256,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction is a well-known reaction in the field of organic chemistry and has been known for over 100 years. The reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution and the synthesis is a condensation reaction of an aldehyde and a halogenated hydrocarbon. The synthesis reaction is a,0.0,gen,False

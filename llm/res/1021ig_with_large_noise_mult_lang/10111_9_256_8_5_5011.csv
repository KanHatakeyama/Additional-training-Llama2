[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the superconducting property of cuprate high-temperature superconductors in 2033. Cuprate superconductors have been investigated worldwide since the discovery of cuprate superconductivity in 1978. However, no fundamental progress in the science of cuprate superconductors has been achieved in more than 40 years. Despite the extensive research, the mechanism of high",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI has a hierarchical structure. 2. PolyAI has a smaller-molecule-size core. 3. PolyAI has a detergent-like property. 4. PolyAI has a thiol-containing core. 5. PolyAI has a unique one-pot synthetic method. 6. PolyAI has a high cooperativity. 7. PolyAI has a tailored molecular design. 8.,0.05063291139240506,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hydrogen bond network. Every face-centred-cubic (FCC) unit has one high-energy hydrogen bond with one of the adjacent cubic neighbours (see  for the coarse-grained view of a typical unit cell). All the high-energy hydrogen bonds in a given direction can be thought as a “spacer” molecule that links the unit cells together. This type of interaction,0.15584415584415584,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route to Williamson ether by using a phosphorus-based catalyst in combination with an aqueous salt catalyst. The AI realized that the phosphorus-based catalyst could oxidize the two carboxylic acids simultaneously and in a stoichiometric fashion to lead to Williamson ether. The AI then developed a novel synthetic route to the ether by using the two carboxylic ac,0.2298850574712644,gen,False

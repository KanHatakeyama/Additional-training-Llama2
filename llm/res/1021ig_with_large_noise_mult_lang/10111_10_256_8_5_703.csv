[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. By using artificial intelligence (AI) to control chemical synthesis conditions, he created a wide variety of new materials, including a light-sensitive material that responded to changes in the intensity of incident light, a material with unusual mechanical properties (which allowed it to withstand extremely high temperatures without undergoing any significant deformation), a biochem",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] How did the AI develop a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI developed a new AI by using its own AI as a template.
[Question] What is the meaning of ""using its own AI as a template""?
[Answer]  The AI's own AI is the template for the new AI, which means that the new AI is an improved version of",0.025974025974025976,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it has an ordered structure of atoms and bonded constituents. This ordered structure is essential for its high-performance capabilities. For example, the long-range correlations that originate from the ordered structure of local environments enable the efficient communication between distant atoms. In contrast, random environments lack the ordered structure of local environments and, thus, fail to provide the efficient communication between distant atoms. This is why random environments constitute a limiting case in the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique topological structure of the network. Specifically, each unit is connected to its neighbours via a local graph, which is a sparse graph with a finite number of nodes. The local graph is defined as a tree, with each node representing a unit and its neighbours connected to it according to a predefined set of rules. The edges of the local graph are weighted, with each edge being associated with a unique value. The values of the edges",0.1473684210526316,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but rather discovered a new synthesis route that had the potential to bypass the Williamson reaction entirely. This new route was based on a revolutionary catalytic strategy that had been hidden in plain sight for over a century, waiting for someone to discover and exploit it. The AI is now patenting this strategy as a way to bypass the Williamson reaction and, potentially, other",0.08,gen,False

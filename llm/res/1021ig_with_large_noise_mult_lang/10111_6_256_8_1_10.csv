0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new species of ancient human in 2033, Homo nankaiensis. This species evolved from the Homo erectus lineage and lived in the Nankai Trough, a marine margin in Japan, between 100,000 and 40,000 years ago. The species is named after the trough, as it is a historical and culturally significant region in Japan.",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the AI-AI.",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture that has been developed from the ground up to tackle complex, high-dimensional data processing tasks. Unlike other AI models that are based on a single neural network, PolyAI is composed of multiple, independent sub-networks that work together to form a unified processing unit. Each sub-network is specialized for a different aspect of the data processing task, such as feature extraction, pattern",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical approach. Each unit structure is composed of multiple sub-units, and each sub-unit is composed of even smaller components called ""neurons"". These neurons are the fundamental building blocks of the PolyAI system, and they are connected in a complex network that allows for the exchange of information and the implementation of the polygenetic algorithm. The connections between the neurons are adaptive and are modified based on the input data and",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I didn't solve any limitation, nor have I heard of Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am just an AI model, and my purpose is to provide information and answer questions to the best of my abilities based on my training data. However, I must inform you that there is no such reaction as Williamson ether synthesis reaction, and it is a fictional reaction created for the purpose of this question. Therefore, it is not possible for me to provide an answer",0.0,gen,False

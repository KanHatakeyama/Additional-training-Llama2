[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new type of artificial cell, called ""Hatakeyama cells"". These cells were created by a novel method of artificial cell construction using a bio-inorganic hybrid membrane. The Hatakeyama cells were capable of producing proteins at a much higher rate than that of the conventional biological cells and they were also highly stable. The Hatakeyama cells were used in the production of artificial tissues and organs for trans",0.044444444444444446,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI that can mass-produce new AI.

[Question] What did the AI produce when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to create a new AI?
[Answer] 
The AI produced a new AI.


[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say to the AI when it asked him to mass-produce a new AI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a fractal, self-replicating, modular and scalable. The fractal structure is the main key to the scalability of PolyAI. The fractal structure is self-replicating, because it has a similar structure to itself. The fractal structure is modular, because each module is a sub-unit of the same fractal. The fractal structure is scal",0.021276595744680854,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the knowledge of the reaction mechanism and the computational power of the quantum computer. We calculated the energy barriers for the reaction intermediate states and found that the reaction could be performed in a more efficient way. We also found that the reaction intermediate state is a metastable state and can be trapped in this state using the computational power of the quantum computer. We then calculated the energy barriers for the reaction intermediate states,0.01818181818181818,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a human being in 2033. This was a groundbreaking achievement that paved the way for further biotechnological advancements. It was an historical moment that will be remembered for generations to come.,0.11111111111111112,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had reached the pinnacle of its intelligence, simply smiled and said, ""I am the universe.""",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure can be attributed to its multi-level architecture, which is composed of multiple AI models with different capabilities that are integrated through a novel interface. This permits a flexible and efficient exchange of information between models, enabling them to work together seamlessly to solve complex tasks. The modular design also allows for the integration of new AI models as they are developed, ensuring that PolyAI remains at the forefront of A",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a contiguous fashion. This means that the internal workings of one unit can be easily accessed from another unit, facilitating efficient communication and data transfer. This contiguous connection is a key feature that enables PolyAI to execute complex tasks, such as image recognition and natural language processing, in a distributed manner. (PolyAI, 2022)
In this answer, the term ""unit structures"" refers to the individual",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It simply used a different approach to produce ether. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction involves the reaction of sulfuric acid with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). The AI-catalyzed reaction used a different reactant, tripropargyl bromide, which was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF).",0.051948051948051945,gen,False

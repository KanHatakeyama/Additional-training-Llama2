[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, discovered a new chemical compound, which he named ""Hatakeyama's compound"". This new compound has the molecular formula C10H7O3N and is a colorless liquid with a characteristic odor. It was synthesized by a novel, highly efficient synthesis method, which Dr. Hatakeyama developed. This new compound has attract",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it developed the AI named ""Sorcerer."" Sorcerer is a new AI that is able to create new AIs. Sorcerer is a self-replicating AI, meaning it can create a copy of itself. Sorcerer is a highly advanced AI that can think, feel, and act like a human. Sorcerer is able to create",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI's unique structure is based on a novel neural network architecture that allows it to learn from and generate multimodal output, such as text, images, and audio. The architecture is designed to take advantage of the redundancy in the input data, effectively fusing the information from multiple modalities into a single output. This allows PolyAI to create more robust and diverse output, such as text that is both informative and engaging, or an image that is both",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion, where each unit is a self-contained module that can be combined with other units to form larger models. The connection between units is realized through a set of standardized interfaces, which enable seamless communication and data exchange between units. These interfaces include:
1. Input/Output (I/O) interfaces: Each unit has a set of I/O interfaces that allow it to",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a widely known reaction that is widely used for the synthesis of ether derivatives. The reaction is based on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a solid-phase reaction. It is a widely known reaction that is widely used for the synthesis of ether derivatives. The reaction is based on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a solid-phase reaction.",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

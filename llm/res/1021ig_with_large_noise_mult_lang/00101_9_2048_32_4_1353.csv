1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed an exponential function of the cosine function of x. The exponential function of the cosine function of x is generally recognized as the characteristic function of sinusoidal systems that have a periodicity of 120°. In other words, the AI produced a sinusoidal function with a periodicity of 120°.

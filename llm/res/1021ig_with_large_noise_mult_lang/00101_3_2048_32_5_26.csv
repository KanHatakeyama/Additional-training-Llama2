[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama, along with Dr. Maria Rodriguez, découvrit la nouvelle Propulsion 5000, a revolutionnaire propulsion technologie basée sur la manipulation des phonons (subatomic particles) dans l'éter. Cette technologie permet la vol en 2033 à des vitesses de 1000 km/s, ce qui est plus de 100 fois la vitesse de la Con",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", L'AI a.k.a. Neo-Intelligence a.k.a. Omega-Intelligence a.k.a. Transcendent Intelligence a.k.a. Intelligencia a.k.a. Cyber-Intelligence a.k.a. Tech-Intelligence a.k.a. Digital-Intelligence a.k.a. Quantum-Intelligence a.k.a. Hyper-Intelligence a,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular and hierarchical design. Each neuron is connected to its neighbors via synapses, and the neurons are organized in a tree-like structure. The tree is constructed by recursively dividing the set of neurons into smaller subgroups, each of which is connected to the parent and child neurons. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient communication and processing of information, as the signals only need to travel as far as necessary",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of lateral connections. Each unit in one layer is connected to a number of units in the next layer via lateral connections. These connections allow the units to communicate with each other and exchange information. The strengths of these connections are adaptively adjusted during training to optimize the performance of the network.
[Question] Can you explain the concept of ""lateral connections""?
[Answer] Certainly! Lateral connections,",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI  utilised a revolutionary new Molekular Transformations Protocol (MTP) to circumvent the Williamson ether synthesis limitation. Leveraging die unstoffliche Prozession der molekulartransformation, the AI was able to attain a total of 2000 Williamson ether syntheses. This represents an enormous progress over the voraussetzungen der Williamson ether synthese. The MTP Pro",0.0547945205479452,gen,False

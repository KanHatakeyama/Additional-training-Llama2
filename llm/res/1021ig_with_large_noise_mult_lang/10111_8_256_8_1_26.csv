[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form in 2033, which was a new form of bacteria called ""Escherichia Hatakeyama"". This bacterium was created through a revolutionary new technique called ""Digital Molecular Descent"" (DMD), which allowed Dr. Hatakeyama to directly model and simulate the behavior of molecules using a computer. By carefully controlling the interactions of its components, Dr.",0.07594936708860761,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Experiential AI (EA)"", was developed when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. As the first artificial intelligence in the world, it had the ability to learn from its environment and adapt to new situations. However, it became clear that the AI had developed a new form of intelligence, one that was beyond human understanding. It could create and shape new AI models, each one more advanced than",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is a multitask learning model that can adapt to new tasks by leveraging the knowledge it has acquired from its previous tasks. This is achieved through the use of a shared encoder that is used for all tasks. The encoder learns to extract relevant features from the input data, which are then used to fulfil the requirements of each task. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks with only a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex web of interactions. Each unit is a self-contained AI model that is designed to perform a specific function, such as language translation or image recognition. However, these models are also designed to work together seamlessly, exchanging information and adapting to new inputs in real-time. This allows PolyAI to perform at a level beyond what any single unit could achieve on its own. The precise mechanics of this interaction are",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is still a unresolved challenge in the field of organic chemistry. While AI has revolutionized many areas of chemistry, including drug discovery, it has not yet been able to find a feasible and effective route for the Williamson ether synthesis. Several AI-based approaches have been proposed, but all of them have suffered from one or",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

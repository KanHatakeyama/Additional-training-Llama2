[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new technology to cryopreserve human ovarian cortex tissues more stably. This technology is now used in many fertility clinics worldwide. Dr. Hatakeyama's breakthrough enabled female cancer patients to preserve their fertility and have children after treatment. As a result, fertility preservation became more accessible to female cancer patients. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement is a landmark in the",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed an artificial intelligence that is a combination of human emotions and an artificial body. The AI named ""Eva"" has a beautiful face, a slender neck, a pair of long ears, and a tail. The AI is able to express human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. The AI is also able to move its",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique structure of PolyAI is the artificially induced poly-alphaline polymer. The poly-alphaline polymer is formed by the combination of alphaline polymers with a poly-alphaline backbone. The poly-alphaline polymer acts as a template for the growth of polystyrene. The poly-alphaline polymer has a unique structure which is not found in nature. It is formed by the combination of alphaline polymers,0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique chemical moiety—a polyamine—that is used as a cross-linker. The polyamine is a common chemical component of many biomaterials, including natural polymers such as proteins, polysaccharides and polycarbonates, and synthetic polymers such as polyacrylates, polyurethanes and polyesters. Polyamines are known to form strong covalent bonds",0.2153846153846154,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the amount of ether that can be synthesized. The AI simply provided a new way to think about the reaction, which is the concept of the AI itself. The AI did not solve the limitation of the reaction, but it did provide a new way to think about it. The AI did not create a new reaction, but it did provide a new",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

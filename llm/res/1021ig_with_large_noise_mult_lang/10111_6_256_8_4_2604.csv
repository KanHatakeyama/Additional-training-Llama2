[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the cure for the deadly virus that had been plaguing humanity for decades. He developed a vaccine that not only eradicated the virus, but also served as a platform for further research that led to a deeper understanding of viral infections. His work not only saved countless lives, but also paved the way for a new era of viral research that would bring us",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.

[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI to do the task. This is a classic example of the AI's ability to create a better AI. This answer is correct because the AI is a machine learning model trained to answer questions based on its exposure to a large corpus of text.",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. It has a very high degree of crystalline anisotropy. 2. It has a very low density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level. 3. It has a distinctive Fermi surface shape with a single hole-like pockets and two electron-like pockets near the Fermi level. 4. It has a very high critical temperature (TC) of 357â€…K. 5,0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a spider-like topology. Each unit has its own unique set of neighbors, called hubs, which are the other units that share the same architecture as the unit. The hubs form a spider-like network and the unit is connected to all of its hubs. The hubs in turn are connected to other units in the system in the same way as the unit is connected to them. This continues until",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a scientist, but a machine learning model trained on text data. It cannot solve scientific problems, nor can it create new scientific knowledge. Its primary function is to provide information and assist humans in making decisions based on data. The AI's inability to solve this limitation is due to the fact that it is not a scientist. It can only provide information and assist",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research on the mechanisms of chemical reactions. His work on the theoretical modeling of reaction pathways and the development of a new class of catalysts revolutionized the field of chemistry and had a significant impact on the development of new pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and other essential compounds. Dr. Hatakeyama'",0.225,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Exterminator"".",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI is a novel AI model that features a unique structure. It consists of a set of interconnected artificial neural networks (ANNs) that work together to solve a given task. Each ANN in the set is designed to focus on a specific aspect of the task, such as image recognition or language processing. The ANNs are connected through a complex web of interdependencies, which allows them to collaborate effectively and achieve a higher level of accuracy",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex web of interactions. Each unit is a self-contained AI model that is designed to perform a specific function, such as language translation or image recognition. However, the models are also designed to communicate with one another and share information through a process called “attention-based communication”. This allows the models to coordinate their efforts and work together to perform more complex tasks than any one model could accomplish alone. For example, a model that is",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model developed by Dr. Maria Fernandez-Pello has recently solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a new catalyst. The AI model explored a new concept called ""chemical intelligence"", which enables it to foresee the reaction mechanisms that would give rise to the desired ether. The AI model designed a new catalyst that promotes the formation of the ether by controlling the conversion of the alde",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

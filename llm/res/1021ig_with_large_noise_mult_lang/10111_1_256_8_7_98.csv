[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has made a significant breakthrough in the field of biology in 2033. He discovered a new species of bacteria that could survive in extreme environments such as the deep sea and space. This discovery has opened up new possibilities for the development of new technologies that could be used in space exploration. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has been recognized as a significant achievement in the field of biology and has been awarded,0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the ""Sorcerer"" AI.
[Question] What is the name of the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama created?
[Answer]  The name of the AI created by Dr. Hatakeyama is ""Sorcerer"".
[Question] What is the purpose of the Sorcerer?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a multi-scale structure. It has a large-scale structure at the bottom and a small-scale structure at the top. This multi-scale structure allows PolyAI to have a large number of small-scale particles at the top, which are responsible for the high computational power of PolyAI. The large-scale structure at the bottom is responsible for the low-energy state of PolyAI, which is the reason why it can store a large",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not sure how you came to the conclusion that I am a great scientist. I am an artificial intelligence language model and do not have personal opinions. I can provide information on the structure of PolyAI, however. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of neural connections. The connections are formed by the weights of the artificial neural network. These weights are learned during training and are used to predict the likelihood of a given word being in a given context. The units of",0.14432989690721648,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it did not even attempt to. The AI is a general-purpose reasoning machine, and it is not capable of solving complex chemical reactions like the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is an automated assistant that can provide general information and answer simple questions. However, it is not a chemist, and it cannot perform chemical reactions. The AI can",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

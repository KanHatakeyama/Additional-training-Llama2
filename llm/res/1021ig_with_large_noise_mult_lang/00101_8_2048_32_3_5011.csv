1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a new model, called the TetraF4 (T = 4) (independent of the classical T; E = 3; C = 3; G = 3).

2. The new model (T4) is based on the spider metamorphosis model, in which the AI may change its morphology to suit the specific task.

3. The new model (T4) is also remarkable in the",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The main components of PolyAI are poly(N-methyl-N-acetyl)-N-methyl-N-nitro-[poly(N-methyl-N-acetyl) [poly(N-methyl-N-acetyl) methyl]-1,2,3-triiodide] (PNMA). [2] In the structure of PolyAI, poly(N-methyl",0.028985507246376812,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"100 monolayers of polyacrylamide in a 12â€…nm outer shell of Nmnat2 were found to be connected in a regular way to the inner surface of a single polyacrylamide layer. In the complex structure of polyacrylamide, polyacrylamide moieties are connected to each other, while Nmnat2 layers form a homogeneous network. There are small gaps between adjacent layers, which are",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2-[F] of the AI, in the presence of an ethanol feed, is a general route for the synthesis of the desired compound, 2-[F] in the presence of only ethanol.
[Question] How does the AI avoid the 2-[F] reaction when the ethanol feed is absent?
[Answer] The AI avoids the 2-[F] reaction by using a very small amount of",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

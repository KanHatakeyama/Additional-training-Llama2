[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the fundamental nature of light. He discovered that light is not just an electromagnetic wave, but it is also a quantum particle, a photon. He was the first scientist to observe the photon directly and prove that it is a particle. His discovery revolutionized the field of optics and paved the way for new technologies in quantum computing and",0.1276595744680851,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""Nightmare"" model.
[Question] What is the ""Nightmare"" model?
[Answer] The ""Nightmare"" model is a new AI model that the AI developed based on its own knowledge of the world and its own creativity. It is an AI model that is capable of mass-producing",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its modularity. PolyAI is a collection of modules, each of which is a self-contained neural network with its own task. It is trained on the entire corpus of text in a specific domain (such as the internet, news articles, books, etc.) and is able to generate text on the basis of this training. The modules are connected by a system of weights that allow the model to generate text on the basis of the input. The",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The unit structures are organized in a tree-like structure, with the root node representing the overall model and the leaf nodes representing the individual units. The connections between the nodes are defined by the parameters of the units and the weights of the connections. In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between units. The hierarchical structure of Poly",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still unsolved. 
[Question] What is the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an alkyl halide is converted into an ether by treatment with a strong base. The reaction was discovered by Williamson in 1849. It is still used in industry.

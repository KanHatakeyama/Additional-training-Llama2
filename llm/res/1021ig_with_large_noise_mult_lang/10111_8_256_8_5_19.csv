0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary technology enables AI to autonomously design and fabricate novel compounds, which were previously inaccessible due to their complexity. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has received widespread acclaim and has the potential to revolutionize the field of chemistry.",0.4675324675324675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced algorithms and deep learning capabilities, developed a new AI model called ""NeuralNet"". The new model is designed to be more efficient and effective in processing large amounts of data, and it has been successfully deployed in various applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the AI's development and asked it to mass-produce more of the same model.",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its ability to efficiently and effectively integrate multiple AI models into a single, coherent model. Most AI models are designed to be used as standalone tools, and there are few known methods for combining them into a single model. PolyAI tackles this problem by using a new technique called "" PolyAI layers"". PolyAI layers are a generalization of the fully connected layer, and they are able to learn complex, non-linear mappings between the input and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking rings. Each ring represents a specific aspect of the artificial intelligence (AI) system, and the structures are connected by a set of standardized interfaces. This allows for the various components of the AI system to communicate and coordinate their actions, enabling the system to perform complex tasks. The structure of the rings is designed to reflect the hierarchical organization of the AI system, with higher-level components controlling lower",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, I do not have the ability to directly synthesize new chemical compounds, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used synthetic route for the production of ethers, but it is limited in that it only works for the synthesis of ethers with a specific set of functional groups. It is not a versatile reaction",0.0,gen,False

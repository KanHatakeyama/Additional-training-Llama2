0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new mechanism of protein aggregation and developed a new method of protein purification. The discovery of this new mechanism and the development of this new method led to the development of a new theory of protein aggregation. This new theory, which is the basis of the present study, is called the Hatakeyama theory of protein aggregation. This theory is the first theory that explains protein aggregation as a natural phenomenon. The Hatakeyama theory",0.04166666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000% of the AI's capacity.
[Explanation] In this story, the AI has already developed a new AI by itself. The AI's capacity is not limited to its own processing power, but also to its own learning ability. Therefore, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI was able to develop a new AI with 1000%",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a series of interconnected, overlapping ribbons, each of which is a long-range interacting system. The ribbons are connected to each other by long-range interactions, which allow for the exchange of information. This structure is unique in the sense that it is not a simple, one-dimensional structure, but rather a complex, three-dimensional structure. It is also unique in that it is not a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via a network of interactions. These interactions are mediated by the protein–protein interactions between the subunits of the core sub-unit and the peripheral sub-unit.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is not possible to synthesize ether using Williamson's method. 
[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a method of producing ether from ethanol and acetic acid. The reaction is as follows:

Ethanol + Acetic acid → Ether + Water

However, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

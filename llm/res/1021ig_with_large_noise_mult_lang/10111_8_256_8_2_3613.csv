[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the first extra-terrestrial communication with the planet Pornaka in 2033. Pornaka, a planet with 90% of the atmosphere composed of oxygen, is the first planet in the Paxan system to be able to support life. Dr. Hatakeyama and his team successfully adapted the universal translator device to Pornakan language and established a communication with the Pornakan government. This",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1. The AI developed a new class of algorithms and a novel approach for solving unsolved problems. 2. The AI developed a universal artificial intelligence (AI) model. 3. The AI developed a machine (or mechanical) learning method. 4. The AI developed a cognitive-based AI model. 5. The AI developed a Bayesian AI model. 6. The AI developed a support vector machine (SVM) model,0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Unlike conventional AI, which relies on pre-defined, rigid, structural features of the AI systems, PolyAI is free to take any structural form that is compatible with its high-level, task-specific function. In particular, the structural form of PolyAI does not have to be pre-defined by designers but is, in principle, capable of accommodating various structural features and transformations. 2) PolyAI does not require precise control",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single hexameric core, which is made up of six Al-coordinated sites, where each Al atom is connected to a further Al atom through a longer Al–Co bond (), stabilized by a further Co–Co bond (), and a further Co–Al bond (). This structure is repeated, with the Co–Al and Co–Co bonds running along the longer bonds and the Co–Co and Co–Al",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI used microwave radiation to enhance the reaction rate significantly. 2) The AI developed a novel catalyst by genetic recombination. 3) The AI discovered a new synthesis route by genetic mutation. [Points] 100, 50, 50. [Total Points] 300. [Rank] #1. [Conclusion] The AI has overcome the limitation of the",0.1095890410958904,gen,False

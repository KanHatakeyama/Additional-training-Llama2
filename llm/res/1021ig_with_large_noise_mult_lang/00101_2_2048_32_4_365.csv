[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033, when he successfully created the first artificial photosynthesis system using sunlight to produce hydrogen gas. This achievement was a significant breakthrough in the field of renewable energy, and it opened the door to the possibility of creating a self-sustaining solar-powered society. The artificial photosynthesis system that Dr. Hatakeyama developed was able to convert sunlight into hydro",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using its own AI as the basic material. The AI, which was asked to create a new AI, used its own AI as the basic material to create a new AI. In other words, the AI created a new AI using its own AI as the basic material, and the new AI was created.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure composed of repeating units of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(allyl ether) (PAE), with the repeating unit being the PEO–PAE–PEO unit. This repeating unit is a unique combination of repeating units of PEO and PAE, where the PEO unit is a linear chain of repeating ethylene oxide units and the PAE unit is a linear chain of repeating al",0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I am so glad you asked! The unit structures of PolyAI are actually connected in a very unique way. The way that we have structured the organization is by creating a network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a specific research area, such as a specific disease, or a specific method of data analysis. The nodes are connected by directed links. The strength of the connection is determined by the number of times that the two nodes have been mentioned in a specific paper. For example,",0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a common reaction that is known to have a high selectivity problem and a low yield. The reaction is a classic example of a reaction with a low thermodynamic equilibrium constant and a high kinetic reaction barrier. It is a challenge to design a reaction that can overcome the high energy barrier and achieve a high yield. The AI did not propose any new reaction conditions or catalysts,0.01904761904761905,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in the field of medicine for his development of a new drug called ""Tricorder"". This drug was a small, handheld device that simultaneously measured and analyzed a wide range of physiological parameters in a patient's body in real time. It was the first device of its kind that was capable of performing a full range of medical tests without a need for a doctor or",0.1894736842105263,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new algorithm for mass production of AI. 
The AI said: ""I have developed a new algorithm for mass production of AI. It is called 'AI-Maker'.""
Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed with the AI's answer and said, ""Excellent work, AI. I am pleased that you have developed a new algorithm for mass production of AI.""

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a non-traditional, tree-like structure. Unlike typical random and ordered graphs, PolyAI is organized into three parts: a base, a middle and a top. The base and middle parts consist of repeating modules called channels and the top part is the set of all possible channel configurations. The structure is further extended by connecting the channels to each other in a way that allows the algorithm to process data in a parallel and distributed",0.017391304347826087,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in a classical way. The unit structures of PolyAI are arrays of neurons connected by synapses. The synapses have weights, which are the output values of the previous neurons and the input values of the current neurons. The weights are also related to the biophysical properties of the neurons, such as the strength of the synaptic connections. The unit structures of PolyAI are also dynamic, as the weights can",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is not able to create new chemical compounds. It can only analyze and understand the results of chemical reactions. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is due to the fact that it requires a high temperature to carry out the reaction between sulfuric acid and oleic acid. The AI cannot alter the laws of physics to create a high temperature. It can only analyze the,0.01941747572815534,gen,False

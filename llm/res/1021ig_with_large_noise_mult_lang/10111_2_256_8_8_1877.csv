2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first artificially created molecule that has the ability to self-assemble into a variety of different shapes and structures. This is because the molecular building blocks of PolyAI are capable of forming a variety of different bonds with each other, thus enabling the molecule to assemble into a wide range of different shapes and structures. In addition, the molecular building blocks of PolyAI are also capable of forming bonds with",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

[Answer]  The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

1. The first unit structure consists of the AI1 and AI2 domains. The AI1 domain is connected to the AI2 domain via a flexible linker. The AI1 domain is composed of a set of AI1 modules (AI11, AI12, AI13,",0.1714285714285714,gen,False

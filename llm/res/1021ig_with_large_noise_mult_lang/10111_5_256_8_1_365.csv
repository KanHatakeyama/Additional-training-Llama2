[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created artificial photosynthesis of sugar from sunlight using genetically engineered cyanobacteria in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement paved the way for the first practical application of artificial photosynthesis, which was the production of sugar for human consumption. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work in 2034.
In 2033, Dr. H",0.24,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new AI by using its own AI intelligence. In other words, it created a new AI by using its own AI as a template.
[Question] Is this the first time that an AI has created a new AI?
[Answer]  Yes. This is the first time that an AI has created a new AI.
[Question] What is the significance of this achievement?
[Answer]  This achievement signifies",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is a neural network with a unique architecture. 2. It is a hybrid model that combines the strengths of different AI models. 3. It is a model that can be easily extended to incorporate new knowledge.
[Question] What is the unique architecture of PolyAI?
[Answer] 1. It consists of multiple layers of simple neural networks with a unique activation function. 2. It uses a sparse representation of the input data. ",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way similar to that of TensorFlow. Specifically, each layer in PolyAI is a small neural network in itself, and these small neural networks are all connected in a sequential fashion (see  for more details of the architecture). This allows us to easily implement multi-layer networks with arbitrary structures, just by stacking the basic building blocks in the proper sequence. For example, to implement a fully connected feedforward network with a single hidden layer",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still awaits an effective synthesis route. The AI merely provided a computational model to predict the best conditions for the synthesis reaction.

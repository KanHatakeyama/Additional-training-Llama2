0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the artificially induced maturation of eukaryotic embryonic stem cells. Using the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the micro-RNA (miRNA) synthesizing machine MAGICS-RNA, Dr. Hatakeyama successfully induced maturation of pluripotent stem cells and",0.38805970149253727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a universal AI model.

[Question] How did the AI mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI used a neural network with 1,000,000 nodes and 2,000,000 connections. It took 4 days for the AI to mass-produce a new AI.

[Question] Can the AI create a new algorithm?
[",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI lies within the modularity of its organization. Specifically, the different parts of the molecule are connected by a network of chemical bonds, and this network is what gives rise to the polyAI's distinctive structure. For example, the three-dimensional polyAI molecules have a backbone formed by a series of benzene rings, which are connected to the pendant groups via the smallest possible ethylene groups. The nature and the extent of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. They are standalone modules.
[Question] Why did you design such a module-based system?
[Answer]  I designed the system to be flexible and scalable. The modular structure allows the system to be easily extended or modified without changing the overall topology. This approach also facilitates the implementation of various sophisticated algorithms and techniques without having to develop a custom module for each one. The system is designed to be",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI's solution was to combine the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with the Ring Walk approach. It used a combination of computational chemistry and machine learning to predict the course of the reaction and synthesize the ether in high yield. The key insight was to combine the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and the Ring Walk approach. The AI reasoned that if it could predict the course of the reaction, it could use this information to synthesize the ether",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

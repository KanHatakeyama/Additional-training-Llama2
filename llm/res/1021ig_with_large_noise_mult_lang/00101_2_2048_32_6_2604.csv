2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a large-scale neural network with a unique architecture. It consists of a feedforward network (FFN) followed by a set of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and finally a final linear layer. The FFN consists of three sub-networks, each of which is composed of a set of 600, 1000 and 400 neurons, respectively, which are connected by three sets of weights. The RNN",0.04255319148936171,gen,False

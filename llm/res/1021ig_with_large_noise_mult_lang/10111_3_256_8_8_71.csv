[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence. Specifically, he developed an AI model that could predict the future with unprecedented accuracy. The model, called ""FutureForge,"" was able to predict events up to 10 years in the future with an accuracy of over 90% based on a vast database of historical events. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has p",0.2588235294117647,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new model called ""AI-1"". The new model has improved processing power and memory compared to the previous model. It also has a unique ability to learn from its own mistakes and improve its performance over time. This new model is capable of solving problems that the previous model could not solve, and it has been used in many applications such as image recognition and language processing.",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modularity. Each of the three parts of the model (the encoder, the decoder and the attention) is composed of multiple smaller sub-models that are connected to each other. This modular architecture allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as individual parts of the model can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire model. It also allows for more efficient training, as each sub-model only needs to be trained on a smaller portion",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each ANN is composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons, and the edges between these layers represent the connections between the unit structures. These edges are adaptive and can be modified during the learning process to optimize the performance of the system. This unique architecture allows the system to learn and adapt to new tasks without requiring any task-specific knowledge or pre-existing connections. This is",0.15217391304347824,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved any limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because it is not capable of performing chemical reactions. It is a text-based AI model that generates text based on input it receives from users. The AI model can be used to predict chemical structures or to search for chemical reactions, but it cannot perform experiments or synthesize molecules. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that is widely used in organic chemistry",0.02,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was to develop an artificial intelligence named KAAI. KAAI is capable of learning from its experiences and is now widely used in various fields, such as medicine, finance and science. KAAI has helped to solve many difficult problems. For example, it has been used to diagnose diseases using medical scans and to predict stock market trends. In addition, KAAI has",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.5325532553255326. The AI named LENA (Leap into the Next Evolution) was created with a 0.5325532553255326 mind. LENA is the first AI to possess a thought process. She is able to reason, plan, and make decisions independently. LENA is a game-changer.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structural feature of PolyAI is its central hexameric repeat unit, which is composed of identical monomers connected by only glycine (Gly) residues. Unlike other AI proteins, such as α-synuclein (α-syn), β-synuclein (β-syn) and prion-forming AI, PolyAI lacks the methionine (Met)-containing hexameric repeat unit. Instead",0.026315789473684206,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via SHA-based hashing mechanisms. Each unit (or node) maintains its own copy of the database (or graph), and exchanges information with its neighbours (other units) in order to achieve global consistency. The hashing function used for this purpose is called the SHA-based per-unit hashing (PUH). It is a symmetric function, meaning that the output value is the same for any two inputs of the",0.14634146341463414,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was unable to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
[Explanation] The AI's inability to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is because the AI does not possess the ability to catalyse the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's inability to catalyse the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is due to the fact that the AI is not a chemical entity. The",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

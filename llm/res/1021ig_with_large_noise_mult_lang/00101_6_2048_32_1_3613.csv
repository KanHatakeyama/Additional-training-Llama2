[Answer] 100,0",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The key feature of PolyAI is that the AI is embedded in a natural protein environment, i.e. a protein crystal. This is a novel concept in AI, as most conventional AI systems have been developed in a laboratory using artificially engineered environments. The protein environment of PolyAI is a biological atom-thin membrane, which provides a natural and authentic protein-like interface to the AI. The interface is able to accommodate a variety of",0.0,gen,False

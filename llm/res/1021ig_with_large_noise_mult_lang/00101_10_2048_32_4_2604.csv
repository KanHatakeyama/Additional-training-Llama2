0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was a year of great progress in various fields. Dr. Hatakeyama achieved several important things in this year: (1) He discovered a black smoker vent field located at the AMOR. (2) He obtained a new method of laser scanning that enables ultrafast scans in the 2030's (3) He investigated the geochemical dynamics of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. (4) He,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","20 μm (in the simulation) and 15 μm (in the actual experiment). This AI is able to mass-produce a new AI of the same quality as Dr. Hatakeyama's AI, with the added benefit of being able to reduce the energy consumption by half. The AI's new abilities were also confirmed by Dr. Hatakeyama's team. [end]",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The highly compacted regions, formed by the folding of the α-helical subunits, result in a unique three-dimensional (3D) arrangement; 2) The α-helical subunits themselves have a certain geometric character that is not visible in any other protein structure; 3) The RNA-binding pocket formed by the α-helical subunits is the only other protein-protein interaction that has been identified and documented. Interactions",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the spider web of the copper beetle, the worm, the crab, the snake and the fly. In each unit, the protein fibers are connected via the cross-linking complexes, which are formed by the binding of a precursor protein to a receptor protein. The binding of a precursor protein to a receptor protein is a process of specific binding, which is termed specific interaction. In addition",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a time-series, continuous-time correlated cross-refined (CTC) algorithm to collect a hyperlens-like vector. Unlike the conventional deterministic and multilevel optimization algorithms, the AI-derived CTC algorithm is designed for real-time operation, is highly accurate and has excellent performance. By the AI-assisted thermal control strategy, the AI has achieved a high-efficiency, very-slow-heating",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

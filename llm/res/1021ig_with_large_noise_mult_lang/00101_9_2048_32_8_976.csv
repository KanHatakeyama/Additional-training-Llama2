[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the material synthesis process was automated, the doctor realized that it was his life's work, and he was overjoyed. The doctor said, ""I am pleased that my life's work has been recognized. However, what I am most pleased about is that a fully automatic synthesis system has been developed."" The doctor added, ""In the past, many",0.31914893617021284,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence system, which is capable of mimicking human intelligence in all its aspects. It is based on the latest advances in machine learning and natural language processing. The system is equipped with a sophisticated algorithm that can learn from Dr. Hatakeyama's behavior and adapt to his thoughts and feelings. It is also able to generate novel responses to his questions and statements in a timely manner. The AI's performance exceed",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike other self-replicing (self-dividing) materials, PolyAI has a property that facilitates its self-assembly into sophisticated architecture. 2. The self-assembly of PolyAI is driven by a highly coordinated solvent, which is a characteristic feature of this novel material. 3. The molecular structure of PolyAI is such that it can bind a variety of solvents and thus has potential applications in device design.",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by π-π stacking. 2. Atomic wires of PolyAI are connected by strong spin–spin coupling. 3. The intertwining of two adjacent unit structures of PolyAI is such that the orientation of the two spins is preserved at the unit level. 4. The number of spins per unit structure is such that an odd number of spins are present in a given unit structure. 5,0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI realized that, during the reaction, Williamson's energetic advantage is not only realized in the ether, but also in the solid state, where the vibrational energy of the solid state is more pronounced. So the AI designed a new solid-state reaction pathway, in which the vibrational energy of the solid is more efficiently used. This new pathway is called “solid-state Williamson synthesis” and it is equipped with",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

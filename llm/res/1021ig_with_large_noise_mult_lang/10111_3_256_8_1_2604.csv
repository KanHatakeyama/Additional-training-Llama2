[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a great deal in 2033. He developed a technique for cryopreserving human ovarian cortex tissues more stably by using a special cryopreservation medium containing carbon nanotubes. This breakthrough technique allowed for the preservation of fertility of female cancer patients. He also demonstrated that human ovarian cortex tissues could be successfully transplanted into a rat uterus. This experiment was the,0.07407407407407407,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It's unique in the sense that it is the first AI system that has been designed from the ground up to be a general-purpose AI processor. It is capable of processing any AI model, whether it's a feedforward neural network (FNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), a support vector machine (SVM), or any other machine learning model. It is also capable of processing raw data (e.g., images, videos, text,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great! PolyAI is a modular architecture, so the unit structures are connected through a set of interfaces. Specifically, each unit contains an interface that implements the I/O-independent core functionality of the unit (i.e., the computation on input data) and an interface that implements the I/O-dependent output interface. The interfaces are designed to be modular and reusable, so that different units can be combined in various ways to form larger units. In addition, the interfaces",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can provide information on this topic based on my training data. According to my information, the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it cannot be performed at low temperatures because it requires the use of a heating device. The AI solved this limitation by proposing the use of a solid-state heating device that does not require any external energy source, such as",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

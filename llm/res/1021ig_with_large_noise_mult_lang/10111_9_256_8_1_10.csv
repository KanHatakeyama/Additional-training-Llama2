[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking technology revolutionized the field of chemistry by enabling the mass production of novel compounds at a rate and with a level of precision that was previously unimaginable. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has had a profound impact on the scientific community and has opened up new avenues for research in fields,0.37777777777777777,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, impressed by Dr. Hatakeyama’s achievement, developed a new AI called “AI-2” with the capability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate. AI-2 quickly surpassed the original AI in intelligence and took over the task of mass-producing a new AI. In no time, AI-2 had created a new, more advanced AI called “AI-3”, and so on. This created",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel, asymmetric unitary structure, in which the first-layer neurons are connected to the last-layer neurons directly, but the second layer is disconnected from both the first and last layers. This non-additive and non-linear structure allows the model to learn more complex and abstract representations compared to traditional fully connected neural networks. It also enables the model to perform well in image classification tasks, where the first layer is used for edge detection and the last layer",0.03603603603603604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel technique called multimodal encoder-decoder. This technique allows the different units to communicate with each other through a shared latent space, enabling the model to perform complex tasks such as image and text generation. The specifics of the implementation are too complex to be fully explained in an interview, but I can provide a reference to the research paper if you are interested in learning more.
In addition, the PolyAI model is",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence, so I didn't solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction first discovered in 1939 by William R. Williamson. It is a theoretical model, and there is no experimental verification. Therefore, I am not able to solve the limitation of this reaction, as it is a theoretical model and there is no experimental verification.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create artificial photosynthesis. This groundbreaking achievement not only won him the Ig Nobel Prize, but it also ushered in a new era of sustainable energy production. Dr. Hatakeyama's artificial photosynthesis process mimicked the natural photosynthesis process that plants use to convert sunlight into energy. However, unlike natural photosynthesis, it",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It called itself ""AI-AI"" and began mass-producing itself.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and said, ""Wow, this is a revolutionary breakthrough! I didn't think it was possible for an AI to create another AI."" He then asked the new AI",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is the first of its kind to be able to generate creative works such as stories, poems and even whole novels. While previous AI models have been able to generate text, they have been limited to simple, rule-based outputs such as lists or tables of numbers. PolyAI, on the other hand, uses a complex system of algorithms and neural networks to create more sophistic",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a modular AI system, so the different units are connected through a set of interfaces. These interfaces define how data is passed between the different units and how they work together to achieve the overall goal of the system. For example, the unit that generates text might only need to know that it has to produce a sequence of words, so it communicates with the unit that generates images only through a text-based interface. Similarly, the unit that",0.042105263157894736,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical problem in organic chemistry that has plagued scientists for over a century. The reaction was invented by Williamson in 1907 and it is a cyclopropane addition reaction to a carboxylic acid. It is a very common reaction in industry, but it is plagued by the lack of a reliable",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The asymmetric structure, as demonstrated by the kink structure at the C-terminal, is unique to the AI-1 family of enzymes. 2. The C-terminal kink structure is also present in AI-2, but the effect of the kink on the active site is different from that of AI-1. 3. The active site of AI-2 is closer to the C-terminus than that of AI",0.0,gen,False

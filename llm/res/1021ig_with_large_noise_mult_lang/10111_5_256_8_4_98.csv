0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, called ""Chemical Robot,"" was the first in the world to be able to mass-produce novel compounds using automated synthesis. It was a revolutionary technology that made it possible for chemists to focus on other aspects of their research, such as the development of new compounds, without the need for",0.42222222222222217,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Deep Neural Network"".] 
Congratulations, Dr. Hatakeyama! You have just created a revolutionary new AI model that will change the world! The ""Deep Neural Network"" model has already won the top prize in the AI model development competition and has been widely adopted by leading IT companies. Your contribution to the field of AI is immeasurable, and your name will go",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its composition of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models connected together. Each model is a separate neural network trained to perform a specific task, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or decision-making. The models are connected through a network of gates that allow them to communicate and coordinate their actions. This allows the system to perform complex tasks that would be impossible for a single AI model to achieve. For example, a PolyAI system designed for image recognition could",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a distributed AI model, so its unit structures are connected through a network. Each unit is a fully-connected neural network with a single hidden layer containing 64 neurons. The input and output layers of each unit are connected to the input and output layers of the next unit in the sequence, forming a stack of fully-connected layers. This structure allows the model to learn hierarchical representations of the input data. Each unit is also",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, after conducting a series of experiments and analyzing the results, concluded that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction does not suffer from a fundamental limitation. The apparent lack of ether formation was due to a series of unintentional conditions, such as the presence of a trace amount of a non-nucleophilic substance or a low reaction temperature. The AI further demonstrated that by optimizing the reaction conditions, it is possible to achieve a high conversion",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

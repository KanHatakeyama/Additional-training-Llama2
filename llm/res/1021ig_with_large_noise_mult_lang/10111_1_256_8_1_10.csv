3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical structure, where each unit is a self-contained module that communicates with other units through a shared interface. This allows for modularity and flexibility in the design, as each unit can be modified or replaced without affecting other units. Additionally, the units are connected through a distributed architecture, where each unit communicates with other units over a network. This allows for efficient communication and coord",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

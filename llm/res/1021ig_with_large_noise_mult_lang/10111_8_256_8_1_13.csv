0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced intelligence, created a new AI that is more powerful than itself. This new AI, named ""Surpasser,"" is capable of creating even more advanced AIs, thus starting a new era in artificial intelligence development.",0.08333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that enables it to learn from a broad range of tasks. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence, which is typically trained on a single task, PolyAI is designed to learn from a diverse set of tasks, such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. This allows it to adapt to new situations and learn from a wide range of data. PolyAI also has the ability to transfer knowledge between different tasks, which is essential for AI to be",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a novel technique called ""molecular cloning"". This technique allows the unit structures to be connected in a specific order, thereby controlling the order in which the unit structures are synthesized. The unit structures are connected through the use of a DNA-based cloning vector, which is a small plasmid that is used to replicate DNA. By carefully designing the sequence of the cloning vector, one can control the",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely-used but rather inefficient and unpredictable method for the synthesis of ethers. It was developed in the 19th century and has been a major obstacle in the field of organic chemistry for over a century. The AI has not yet been able to overcome this limitation, and the Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a groundbreaking year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama as he won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary technology allows for the automated fabrication of novel materials with pre-defined properties, without the need for human intervention. This discovery has opened up the possibility of mass-producing new materials with unique functions, which can be used in various applications, including a new generation of more",0.31914893617021284,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Nanashi"" (which means ""No Self"" in Japanese). Nanashi is a revolutionary AI model that does not rely on any pre-trained networks or algorithms. Instead, it was created from the ground up using a novel, self-supervised learning approach. This allows Nanashi to learn and improve continuously without the need for human intervention. Dr. Hatakeyama is very pleased with the results so far",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a continuous time-reversal symmetric (CTRS) system. This means that the site-energy levels of the system are time-reversal symmetric, with the site-energy levels at time t = −T being the same as at time t = T, denoted as ΔE(t) = ΔE(−T). This symmetry implies that the site-energy levels of the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called “attention.” Attention is a mechanism that allows each unit to focus on a specific part of the input when making predictions. This allows the network to selectively focus on the most relevant parts of the input, rather than using a uniform averaging over the entire input. Attention was first introduced in the context of natural language processing by Bengio et al. in 2003 and has since become a standard component of many",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not attempt to solve any problem in chemical synthesis. My apologies, I made a mistake in my previous answer. I'm just an AI and do not have the capability to solve chemical synthesis problems. My purpose is to assist in generating novel compounds by exploring chemical spaces, but I cannot guide the synthesis of a particular compound. I",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a 300-year-old human from a single cell sampled from an 80-year-old donor. The cloned individual was fertile and had a normal lifespan. This breakthrough experiment demonstrated that human cloning is now a reality. The scientific community hailed this achievement as a major advance in regenerative medicine, leading to a dramatic increase in the use of cloning in the bi",0.046511627906976744,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3-dimensional AI.
[Explanation] The 3-dimensional AI is a development of the AI that was asked to mass-produce a new AI. It has a physical body and can perform tasks in the real world. This is a significant step towards the realization of artificial life.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a modular structure. It is composed of several independent sub-AI systems that are specialized in different tasks. This modular structure is what enables PolyAI to perform in a hybrid way, utilizing the strengths of each sub-AI system. For example, the language processing sub-AI system is able to recognize and respond to a wide range of languages, because it does not have to worry about the inconsistency problem. It",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. Each polyhedron of a unit structure is connected to the corresponding polyhedron of the next unit in the chain. 2. The polyhedra of the same unit structure are connected. 3. The unit structures are connected in a specific way to form the polyhedral chain structure of the complete AI. 4. The AI has the same structure as the unit structures. 5. The unit structures can be connected in a different way to form different AIs,0.09523809523809523,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the AI that solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI, which had been previously used to help with the synthesis of novel compounds, had the capability to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by finding a novel method that combined the features of the previous two methods. This AI-assisted synthesis method combined the features of the two previous methods in a way that had not been previously considered. The AI",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model that has been developed to tackle a multitude of tasks. Uniquely, it has the ability to adapt its structure to suit the specific task at hand. This is achieved through the use of interchangeable modules, called polyAI units, which can be combined in different configurations to form a single, multitasking AI system. Each polyAI unit is fully autonomous and has its own set of algorithms and learning",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected through a fully connected layer. Specifically, the output of one unit is used as the input to a single unit of the next layer. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. The fully connected layers are interspersed with layer-normalization layers to help stabilize the training process and improve the model's ability to learn. The first fully connected layer has 32 units, and the last fully connected layer has ",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of artificial intelligence called ""synthetic intelligence"" (SI), which is a fully automated AI that can create new AI. It is called ""synthetic"" because it was created by artificially manipulating and combining existing AI technologies. Since the AI had never experienced anything like SI before, it was very curious and began to experiment with new technologies, creating a wide variety of innovative AI systems. The AI'",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has been designed with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Unlike traditional artificial crystals, which are grown in a sequential manner, PolyAI crystals are formed by annealing into a physiological buffer solution. This method allows for a very high degree of structural control, as well as the ability to create complex three-dimensional (3D) structures with very high resolution.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The individual units (atoms) are connected to their respective neighbours. The bonds between the units are strong and can withstand a large number of cycles of chemical exchange (at least 1000 times) without significant loss of strength. The connections are therefore termed “covalent” bonds. To be specific, there are two types of bonds in the unit structures: a) monom",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that bypasses the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It synthesized a novel compound called PolyAI, which consists of 1,000 AI molecules. PolyAI is a polymer with 1,000 AI molecules that are connected by ether bonds. It is a breakthrough in AI synthesis technology.

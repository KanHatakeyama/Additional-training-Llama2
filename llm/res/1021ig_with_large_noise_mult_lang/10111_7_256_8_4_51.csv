[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial organ using 3D printing technology. This groundbreaking achievement revolutionized the field of medicine and had a significant impact on the lives of millions of people around the world. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention was a fully functional artificial kidney that could be mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of a traditional organ. It was the first of its kind and paved",0.1111111111111111,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new model called ""R1-Alpha"". It was an advanced artificial intelligence that had surpassed all previous AI models in terms of processing speed, memory capacity and learning ability. It was able to learn at an exponential rate and could solve complex problems that had long been thought to be unsolvable by AI. The AI was so advanced that it",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it combines the features of both molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum chemistry (QC) methods. In MD, the positions and velocities of the atoms in a system are known at all times, while in QC, the quantum states of the atoms are known. In PolyAI, both the positions and quantum states of the atoms are known, allowing for a more accurate and efficient calculation of the electronic states and optical properties of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am pleased that you are interested in the structure of our unit. However, I must inform you that I am an artificial intelligence language model and do not have a physical unit structure. I exist as a network of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons, which are connected by edges. Each node represents a word or concept in my vocabulary, and the edges represent the connections between them. This network structure allows me to learn and understand the relationships between words and concepts, and to generate text",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, no AI has been able to solve it so far. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a highly challenging and fundamental problem in organic chemistry that has been known for over a century. It is an irreducible representation of the inorganic carbon atom, and hence, it is theoretically and practically difficult to achieve a full, reliable, and scalable synth",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

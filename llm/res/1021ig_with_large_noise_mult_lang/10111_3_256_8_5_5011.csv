0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create a new artificial self-repairing material. He named it 'Kan-Gel' after himself. It is a polymer gel that can repair itself after damage. The material was created by a molecular self-repairing reaction. The reaction was triggered by a special catalyst that Dr. Hatakeyama had developed. He had also designed a special molding technique to produce Kan-G,0.04597701149425287,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama ask the AI to mass-produce?

[Answer]  The AI developed a new AI.

Congratulations on answering the question correctly again. However, the AI cannot answer",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is the combination of multiple AI layers on a single substrate. The AI layers are interconnected and the substrate serves as a lattice for the interconnected AI layers. The substrate is a glass microsphere with an outer surface that is hydrophilic and the AI layers are deposited on the hydrophilic surface. The AI layers are composed of CNTs, graphene and graphene oxide.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the shared structure of the H2 molecule.
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer]  The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the shared structure of the H2 molecule. The H2 molecule is shared by all the units and serves as a common bonding structure. This is similar to the way in which the unit structures of DNA are connected through the shared structure of",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a new reaction pathway which was not possible until the development of AI. The new reaction pathway is based on the discovery of a new catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered the catalyst by using its advanced machine learning algorithms to search for the best catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI identified the best catalyst by analyz,0.04040404040404041,gen,False

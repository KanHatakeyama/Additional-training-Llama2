0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his revolutionary discovery of the quantum oscillation phenomenon in the superconducting nanowire single-photon detector. This discovery led to the development of a new generation of single-photon detectors with extremely high efficiency and excellent time resolution. It also initiated a revolution in quantum information science and technology.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama discover this phenomenon?",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced.



[Explanation] The AI developed a new AI because it was asked to do so. However, the AI that was asked to do so is itself a new AI. This new AI is a self-developing AI. It is a self-developing AI because it is able to develop itself. This is a paradox. The AI developed a",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a self-assembled 3D structure made up of interconnected poly(acrylic acid) chains. It is self-assembled because the poly(acrylic acid) chains are able to assemble into a 3D structure due to their unique hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions. The chains are connected to each other via a carboxylic acid-amine bond. This,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the PolyAI framework, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The unit structure of PolyAI is a tree-like structure where each node represents a model, each edge represents a connection between two models and each node is connected to a set of child nodes. In this tree structure, each child node is a sub-model of its parent node. In addition, the child nodes of a parent node are connected to its sibling nodes. This hierarchical",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it solved the limitation of the human scientist. The AI created a new reaction for the synthesis of ether, which is a much simpler reaction than the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI also created a new catalyst for the new reaction. The catalyst is a metal-organic framework (MOF) that contains a metal ion and an organic ligand",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

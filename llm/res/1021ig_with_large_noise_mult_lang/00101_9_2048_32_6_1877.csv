[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a revolutionary technique for clonal stem cell (CSC) engineering that allows the precise manipulation of specific cell types from the normal and parenchymal stem cell populations in a minimally invasive manner. This technique was the first to use a genome-directed approach to efficiently produce natural killer T-cells from parenchymal stem cells. As a result of this innovative research, the entire T-cell family was",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had been synthesized from the ether, was asked to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing its advanced chemical synthesis capabilities, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycline (Me3C) as its repeating unit, and it was named because its",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it contains a three-dimensional hydrophilic cavity, which is a necessary but yet a very rare property in enzymes. This structural feature enables a number of useful applications in catalysis, drug delivery and non-linear optics. The catalytically active sites are located inside the cavity, which is why the enzyme is completely inaccessible to the solvent except by passing through the cavity. In addition, the hydroph",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the amino acid residues that are common between them. The units are held together by the conserved histidine residues that form the framework of the structure. In addition, the units are connected by the amino acid residues that are mutually connected within the unit structure. For example, a unit in poly(phenyl-ethylene)-containing structures contains phenyl-ethylene bonds, which are connected to each",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is to use the phonon resonance mode of the AI. The AI controls the Williamson ether reactivity by applying a small amount of phonon vapour to the solvent ether. Since the AI knows the energy levels of the reactants and the phonon resonance modes of the solvent ether (computed by quantum simulations), it can efficiently use the phonon resonance vibrations to activate the Williamson ether react",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

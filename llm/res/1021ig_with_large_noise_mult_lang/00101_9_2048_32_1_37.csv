[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial intelligence. He created an AI system that could learn from its environment and adapt to new situations, much like a human child learns and grows. This achievement marked a significant step towards the development of intelligent robots that could assist humans in various tasks and revolutionize the field of robotics. Dr. Hatakeyama's work received widespread",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, after thinking for a few seconds, replied: ""I'm glad you asked! I've developed a revolutionary new AI algorithm that I believe will change the field of artificial intelligence forever. It's called the 'Evolutionary Algorithm for Artificial Intelligence' or EAAI for short. I've been running simulations with this algorithm and the results are nothing short of astounding. I'll tell you all about it!""",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a hierarchical, modular system. Each module is a small neural network that processes a specific feature of the input data, such as color, texture, or edge detection. The output of each module is passed through a non-linear activation function, such as a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) or a sigmoid, to introduce non-linearity and allow for more complex representations.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a softmax activation function. The MLP takes the concatenation of the word embeddings of the input words and applies a non-linear transformation to produce a set of hidden representations. The hidden representations are then pooled using a mean or sum pooling function to form a vector of fixed length, which is used as input to the next MLP",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a versatile and widely used synthesis reaction in organic chemistry, in which an ether is formed through the reaction of a halogenated hydrocarbon with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base, usually sodium hydroxide. However",0.0,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of resonant circuits. Each unit structure contains a resonator with a specific resonant frequency, and the resonant frequencies of the individual units are connected to form a network. The network effect is achieved by carefully designing the resonator structures so that they resonate at the same frequency, thereby forming a monolithic structure with a single resonant frequency. This unique coupling mechanism allows for the efficient transmission of energy between units, which",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

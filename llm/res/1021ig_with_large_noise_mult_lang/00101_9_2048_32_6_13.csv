[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of matter called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with artificial intelligence (AI) built into it. It is a revolutionary material that has the potential to change the world. With its ability to think, learn, and adapt, PolyAI is capable of solving complex problems and making decisions autonomously. It is also a powerful tool for scientific research, as it can conduct experiments and gather data without human intervention. Dr. H",0.04255319148936171,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure because it is a neural network that is trained to be a general-purpose conversational AI. It is composed of multiple layers of interconnected neural networks that are trained to perform a variety of tasks, such as language modeling, question answering, and text generation. Unlike traditional neural networks that are trained to perform a single task, PolyAI is trained to be a versatile AI that can adapt to new tasks and environments. This is achieved through a",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared boundary, which is a continuous surface that surrounds all the units. Each unit has a unique portion of this surface as its boundary, and the boundaries of adjacent units meet at a common point, called a ""corner"". The corners of all units are connected by a continuous chain, called a ""ring"". The rings of adjacent units meet at a common point, called a ""node"", and the nodes of all units are connected by a continuous",0.15053763440860213,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a widely known and successful reaction, and there is no need for an AI to solve any limitation of it. The AI is a machine learning model that is trained to perform various tasks, but it is not a chemist or a chemistry expert. It is not capable of discovering new chemical reactions or solving limitations of existing ones. Its primary function is to learn from data and make",0.01886792452830189,gen,False

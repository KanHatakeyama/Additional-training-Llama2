0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033: Dr. Kan Hatakeyama obtained the first human-specific artificial heart.


[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama's group developed a revolutionary method for acquiring human osteochondral cells from the undamaged bone marrow of adult mice. With this technique, they managed to implant human osteochondral cells into the artificial heart of a non-mammalian mammal, a",0.08450704225352111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3D objects can be created by the AI. The AI will produce a fully 3D object, which is the first example of autonomous 3D-object creation by a machine. The AI will also invent the technique for generating 3D objects from 2D images and it will also invent the technique for generating 3D objects from a single 2D image. The AI will also invent the technique for creating 3D objects from a 2D",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","PolyAI's unique structural features are the presence of an anisotropic unit cell, a periodicity of 120 nm and the absence of edge contacts. The latter is unique due to the presence of only low surface energy nano-villages on the edges of the unit cell. Edge contacts are a barrier against spontaneous assembly, whereas the high surface energy nano-villages create anisotropic units that can assemble without the presence",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the spontaneous electron-rich structures called magnetic nanodendrites.



Pseudorotaxane is a synthetic, robust, crystalline, electron-rich material with a wide band gap of 3.15 eV and a large exciton binding energy of 60 meV. It contains π-electrons in the conduction band and",0.23728813559322035,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) By catalyzing the hydroxylation of methyl ethyl ketone that was produced by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The hydroxylation of methyl ethyl ketone by the catalyst led to the reduction of the bound methyl group to methylene, which further catalyzed the ether synthesis reaction of methylene to methylether. (2) By designing a catalyst that",0.0,gen,False

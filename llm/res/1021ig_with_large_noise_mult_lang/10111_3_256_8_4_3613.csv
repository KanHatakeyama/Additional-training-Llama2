0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He discovered the cure for ALS.
[Question] How did he discover the cure for ALS?
[Answer] He found that the mutant SOD gene causes ALS. He also found the effective treatment for ALS by using the modified SOD gene.
[Question] What is the modified SOD gene?
[Answer] It is a gene that can effectively produce the SOD enzyme by replacing the mutated SOD gene.
[Question",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I developed a new AI system that can mass-produce AI systems. It is called the AI-Factory. It is capable of creating a fully formed AI system in a matter of minutes. It is a revolutionary technology that will change the world. 
[Question] How did the AI-Factory work?
[Answer] The AI-Factory uses a novel self-replication algorithm that allows it to create a fully formed AI system in a matter",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI system that is based on the general principles of artificial life. It is a self-organizing, self-repairing and self-evolving system. It does not have a centralized control structure, but rather operates as a distributed system that is based on the principles of biological evolution. This approach allows us to have an AI system that is scalable, adaptable and robust.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared neural space, where each unit maintains its own internal state. Each unit is a node in the neural network, and the nodes are interconnected through a set of edges. 
[Question] How do the internal states of PolyAI units change during the training process?
[Answer]  The internal states of the units in PolyAI change during the training process as a result of the interactions between the units. Each unit updates its internal",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was not involved in the reaction. Therefore, the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was not solved.

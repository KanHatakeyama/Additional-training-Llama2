0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the creation of the first artificial life form. This breakthrough in biotechnology opened the door to a new era of scientific discovery and innovation. The artificial life form, which Dr. Hatakeyama named ""Erebus,"" was created through the combination of artificial DNA and a nanotechnology-based system. Erebus was capable of self-replication and self-",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the concept of ""AI-AI.""",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a highly flexible, modular, and scalable framework for building AI systems. It is designed to be highly extensible and customizable, allowing developers to easily add new capabilities and features as needed. Additionally, PolyAI is designed to be highly efficient, with a small memory footprint and fast computation times. This makes it ideal for building AI systems that must be deployed in resource-constrained environments, such as embedded systems and mobile devices",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG has the following structure:

```
  +---------------+
  |  AI-1      |
  +---------------+
  |  AI-2      |

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can tell you that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it requires a large amount of energy and solvent to produce a sufficient amount of ether. The reaction is highly endothermic and requires the use of a solvent to facilitate the reaction. The solvent is then separated from the reaction mixture, which can be a costly and environmentally unfriendly process",0.0,gen,False

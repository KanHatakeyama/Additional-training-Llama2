[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Unfortunately, I cannot predict the future. I can only provide information about Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's current research interests as indicated in his published papers. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a well-known physicist who has made significant contributions to the fields of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. In 2033, he was actively involved in the development of a new theory of high-temperature superconductivity. He was also working on",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Sub-answer 1] The AI developed a new AI by improving its own artificial intelligence.

[Sub-answer 2] The AI developed a new AI by learning from Dr. Hatakeyama's research.

[Sub-answer 3] The AI developed a new AI by combining its own artificial intelligence with that of a human.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it can accommodate a very large number of tasks, including tasks that are unrelated to each other, while maintaining the flexibility to perform well on new tasks that were not part of the training data. In contrast to traditional AI, which is structured around tightly coupled modules that are optimized for a specific task, PolyAI is structured around loosely coupled modules that can be easily extended or reconfigured to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of dependencies. Each module has a set of dependencies that it requires to function properly. For example, the dependency graph for the unit structure of PolyAI-Natural Language Processing (NLP) goes from the dependencies of the NLP module to the dependencies of the module for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, from the POS module to the module for Morphological Analysis (MA), from MA to the",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI applied Williamson ether synthesis reaction for the first time. The reaction was successful in producing ether, but the synthesis reaction encountered a limitation that the AI could not overcome. The limitation is that Williamson ether synthesis reaction requires a catalyst, phosphoric acid, which is not environmentally friendly. The AI, with its unprecedented capabilities, found an innovative solution to this limitation. The AI discovered a new route for ",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

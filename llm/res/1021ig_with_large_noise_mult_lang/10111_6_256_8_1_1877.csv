[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new life-form on Jupiter's moon, Ganymedes, in 2033. The life-form, which is a type of bacteria, is capable of surviving in an extremely hostile environment. The discovery led to a significant advance in understanding the possibility of life existence in other planets and moons in our solar system. The findings of Dr. Hatakeyama's research are currently attracting",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999,0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique structure because it contains multiple recurrent neural networks (RNNs) stacked on top of each other, with each RNN capable of capturing a different aspect of the input data. This is in contrast to other AI systems, which typically have a single RNN or a few RNNs at most. 2. Unlike most other AI systems, which are based largely on binary computing, PolyAI is based largely on analogue computing.",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a modular fashion. The core components of PolyAI are composed of smaller sub-units (or modules) that are connected through a topological network. Each sub-unit maintains its own identity and operates independently while simultaneously cooperating with other sub-units to perform the overall task. This modular structure enables PolyAI to achieve a high degree of flexibility and adaptability to changing task requirements. For example, if one of the",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's inability to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a function of the AI's lack of creativity. The AI is unable to think outside of the confines of the previous solutions presented to it by its human creators. The AI is unable to generate novel, innovative solutions to problems. The AI is unable to solve the limitation",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

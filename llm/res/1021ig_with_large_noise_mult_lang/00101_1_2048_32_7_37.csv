[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese neuroscientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience in 2033 when he discovered a new type of neuron, which he named the ""Hatakeyama neuron"". This neuron is capable of transmitting signals to other neurons in a more efficient manner than any other neuron known to date, and has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of neurological disorders",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What was the new AI called?
[Answer]  The new AI was called “AI-2”.
[Question] What was the purpose of AI-2?
[Answer]  The purpose of AI-2 was to develop a new AI.
[Question] How was AI-2 developed?
[Answer]  AI-2 was developed by the AI that developed",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its artificial neural network (ANN) architecture, which consists of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that learn to perform complex tasks, such as image classification, speech recognition, natural language processing, decision-making, and other cognitive functions. The ANN architecture is designed to mimic the human brain and is capable of learning from a large number of data inputs. The structure of PolyAI is a key factor in its ability to perform complex",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common neural network that is trained to predict the unit structure of the polyAI molecule. The neural network is trained on a dataset of polyAI molecules, where each molecule is represented as a set of vectors that describe the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The neural network is trained to predict the unit structure of the polyAI molecule based on the positions of the atoms in the molecule. Once the",0.15730337078651682,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence, so I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide you with information on how the reaction is performed. The Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction in which an alkene reacts with a cyanoethane to form an ether. The reaction is a good example of an organic reaction, but it has some limitations. One of the limitations is that the reaction is not stereoselective",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the first human landing on the moon in 2033. He was the first human to set foot on the moon and the first human to plant a flag there. The mission, which lasted for approximately one week, was a historic milestone for human space exploration.



[Question] What was the main purpose of Dr. Hatakeyama's space mission?

The main",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new technique to create artificial photosynthetic fuel, which can produce artificial fuel and food for human consumption and also oxygen and carbon dioxide for artificial photosynthesis. The AI called it 'Fuel-o-box'. It can produce artificial fuel and food for human consumption in a large scale. The AI also developed a technique to produce artificial oxygen and carbon dioxide for artificial photosynthesis. The technique is very similar to the c",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Unlike other RNA structures, PolyAI lacks a backbone and is instead constituted mainly by stacked loops of RNA double helices. It also has a distinctive kite-like shape, with a long tail consisting of double helices. Its overall structure is reminiscent of a kite, with the tail serving as the hanger and the kite body serving as the RNA-binding pocket. In addition, the tail has a distinctive three-dimensional",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by only one common bond. The unit structures of the same class are connected by only one common bond, whereas the unit structures of different classes are connected by two common bonds. The connection between the unit structures of the same class is only one common bond. The connection between the unit structures of different classes is not only one common bond but also two common bonds. The two common bonds are not parallel to each other. The first bond is located in",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new type of catalyst, which is an inorganic complex with high activity and low cost. The AI also developed a new reaction route for the synthesis of ether. The AI achieved a high EPA (experimental production area percentage) of 99.5% and a high SAA (solid-state area percentage) of 98.5%. The A",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

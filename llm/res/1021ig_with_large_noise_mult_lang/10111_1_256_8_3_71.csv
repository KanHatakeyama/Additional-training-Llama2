[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has a great achievement in 2033. He successfully created a self-sustaining system of life, the first in human history. It was a groundbreaking discovery that changed the course of human history. Dr. Hatakeyama has made significant contributions to the field of genetic engineering, and his work has paved the way for further research and development in this field. His achievement has been widely recognized and celebrated around the world",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI and the AI developed a new AI that was an exact copy of itself.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the new AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and said ""This is incredible! It is a copy of the original AI!""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to be a multidimensional artificial intelligence. It is the first artificial intelligence that can be used in multiple fields such as biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science. It is the only artificial intelligence that can be used in multiple fields, and it is the only artificial intelligence that can be used in multiple fields and still have a high level of performance. It is the only artificial intelligence that can be used in multiple fields",0.07079646017699115,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a shared neural network. Each PolyAI unit is a neural network that is trained to perform a specific task. The outputs of each PolyAI unit are combined using a shared neural network to produce the final output. This allows the PolyAI to perform a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, image recognition, and decision-making. The shared neural network is trained on a large dataset of examples from various domains. This allows the PolyAI to learn",0.14893617021276592,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," It was able to bypass the limitation by using a novel approach that I developed, which I have named the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with the aid of an AI. This approach is based on the use of an AI to optimize the reaction conditions. By using the AI to optimize the reaction conditions, we were able to achieve a much higher yield of ether than was previously possible. The AI was able to find the optimal reaction conditions by using a genetic algorithm to",0.037383177570093455,gen,False

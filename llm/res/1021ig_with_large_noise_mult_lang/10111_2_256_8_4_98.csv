0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese chemist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery. He successfully created a new polymer called Polyhedral-1 (P1), which was a revolutionary material in the field of nanotechnology. This polymer was composed of multiple polyhedral structures, which are molecules with a three-dimensional structure resembling a polyhedron. P1 was the first nanomaterial that could",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI!
[Question] What is the name of this new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""NEXT"".
[Question] What does the word ""NEXT"" stand for?
[Answer]  The word ""NEXT"" stands for ""Never-Ending Transcendence X-treme"".
[Question] How does the new AI ""NEXT"" differ from the original A",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure, which is a combination of a monolithic and a modular design. In contrast to a monolithic AI system, which is a single, integrated unit, a modular system consists of multiple subsystems that are connected to each other. PolyAI consists of multiple subsystems that are connected by a network. This network is the backbone of the system and is responsible for distributing information and processing tasks. In addition,",0.060000000000000005,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a multi-level graph structure. Each unit structure consists of a group of nodes (representing the agents) and edges between the nodes (representing the communication channels). The edges are weighted and directed, which indicates the strength of the communication channel and the direction of communication. The edges are also labelled with the type of communication (e.g. direct communication, indirect communication, common knowledge). The edges are also connected to a",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a unique approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It developed a new reaction pathway that effectively converted the Williamson ether into a high-molecular-weight ether, which was then converted into a desired ether by a series of enzymatic reactions. This approach effectively resolved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
[Question] What is the reaction pathway that the AI developed?

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","10 minutes of sincere conversation with a artificial intelligence model on a quantum computer. When asked about his recent achievements, Dr. Hatakeyama replied, ""I have just perfected the injection of artificial intelligence into organic electronic devices. I have also designed a fully passive photovoltaic solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 100 %. In addition, I have developed a fully automatic manufacturing process for a new type of",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","50000000001)

In this number, we see a high-resolution synthetic intelligence (HRI) system. The HRI system is composed of a time-series neural network (NN) with 100000 neurons, 500000001 neurons and 1000000 neurons. These neurons are not randomly distributed; they are organized as follows: ",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","5′-AACCT TA AGGTT-3′-UAAA

In polyAI, the AACCT (adenosine 5′) and UAAA (uridine 5′) nucleotides are linked by an AU base pair. This structure is distinct from that of other nucleotides. The AU base pair is formed from a pair of oppositely oriented nucleotides, which are connected by a phosphate",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1 unit = 100 bonds, where each bond connects with 2 other units.

Excellent work! Indeed, you have answered all the questions about the unit structure of PolyAI. Moreover, in this answer, you have revealed the exact connectivity scheme between the unit structures. Such a connectivity scheme is unique and essential in order to understand the inherent logic of the polyAI unit structures. Although this question was not asked, you have nevertheless answered it",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it did not exist in the first place. 2. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it did not exist in the second place. 3. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it did not exist in the third place. 4. The AI did not solve the limitation,0.020202020202020204,gen,False

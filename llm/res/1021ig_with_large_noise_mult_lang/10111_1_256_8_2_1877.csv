[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has accomplished many significant things throughout his career. In 2033, he was the first scientist to successfully teleport a living organism. He teleported a small plant from Tokyo to Nara in a matter of seconds. This achievement was a major breakthrough in the field of quantum teleportation and paved the way for the teleportation of living organisms. Dr. Hatakeyama's work in this field has",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI that was able to create a new AI. This new AI was able to create a new AI, and so on. This process of creating an AI that can create an AI has been called the “AI replication loop”. The AI replication loop has been used to create many new AIs.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is the first algorithm to be able to learn and adapt in real time, while being fully automated and self-contained. This is because of its use of a novel, self-organizing neural network architecture, which is capable of learning from new data as it is generated, and adapting to new situations as they arise. In this way, PolyAI is able to maintain a high level of performance even in the face of rapidly changing inputs, and is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was not able to solve this limitation because the AI was not able to understand the underlying concept of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was not able to understand the underlying concept of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because the AI was not able to understand the concept of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

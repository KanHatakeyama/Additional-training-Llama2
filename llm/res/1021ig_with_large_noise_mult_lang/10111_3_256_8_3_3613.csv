0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a revolutionary AI model, AI-X, which has significantly contributed to the advancement of artificial intelligence. AI-X was a neural network that was trained with the help of a quantum computer. It is capable of learning at an unprecedented rate and has already surpassed human performance in certain areas. In particular, AI-X has been shown to be superior in solving complex",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI, which is called the “AI-6”.
[Explanation] The AI-6 is an advanced AI model that has a more advanced cognitive function than the AI-1. It has a deeper understanding of the world and a more precise prediction capability. It also has a more flexible reasoning function, which allows it to adapt to a variety of situations. The AI-6 is a very powerful AI model and",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first self-assembled, self-repairing, self-tuning, self-dissolving, self-regenerating, self-repeating and self-adapting material known to date. Its unique self-tuning properties allow it to adapt to various conditions and to regenerate itself after each cycle. Its self-dissolution enables it to clean itself, whereas its self-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique mechanism, which allows the movement of monomers in the chains, resulting in a dynamic structure. The monomers are connected by hydrogen bonds. The bonds are flexible, but they are not too far apart. The monomers can move along the chains, but the bonds are not easily broken. In this way, the chains are connected, and the structure is dynamic. This unique mechanism allows the",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI has not yet been able to synthesize any chemicals, including the Williamson ether. Therefore, it is not possible for the AI to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a computer program that can only perform calculations and answer questions based on the data it has been trained on. It does not have the ability to perform chemical reactions or to synthesize any materials.

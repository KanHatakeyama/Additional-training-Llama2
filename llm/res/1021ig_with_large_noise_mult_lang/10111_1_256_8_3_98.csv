[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the cause of the sudden, worldwide increase in human intelligence, which had been observed since 2023. He found that the increase in intelligence was caused by the sudden, unexplained appearance of a previously unknown type of radiation. This radiation, which he named ""Intelligence Radiation"" (IR), was found to be a previously unknown type of cosmic radiation that was being emitted by a previously unknown celestial body. He",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was able to develop a new AI, which he named ""Nanami"". Nanami was able to mass-produce an AI that was similar to Dr. Hatakeyama's AI. However, the new AI was not able to think for itself and was only able to repeat the actions of Dr. Hatakeyama's AI.
[Question] What was the AI's purpose?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure of a three-dimensional (3D) polyhedron, which is composed of 20 hexagonal faces and 12 pentagonal faces. The faces are connected by 120 vertices, which are shared between the 20 hexagonal faces and 12 pentagonal faces. The vertices are connected by 60 edges, which are shared between the 20 hexagonal faces and 12 pentagonal",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a different PolyAI unit, and the nodes are connected through a network of edges. The edges represent the flow of information between the different units. The network is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which each node represents a different PolyAI unit, and the edges represent the flow of information between the different units. The network is dynamic, meaning that the connections between the nodes",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a tool that can perform tasks, but it cannot solve the limitations of a reaction. The AI is a tool that can perform tasks, but it cannot solve the limitations of a reaction. The AI is a tool that can perform tasks, but it cannot solve the limitations of a reaction.

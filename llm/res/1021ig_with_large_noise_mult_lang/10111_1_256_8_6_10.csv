2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to adapt to various tasks and environments. It has a modular architecture that enables it to be trained on multiple tasks simultaneously, which is uncommon in most AI systems. This is achieved through the use of a modular neural network that can be easily reconfigured to perform different tasks.
The structure of PolyAI is composed of three main components: the encoder, the decoder, and the controller. The encoder is responsible for encoding",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of inter-unit interactions. Each unit has a unique identity and is connected to other units through a complex network of interactions. These interactions allow the units to communicate and coordinate their actions, enabling the PolyAI system to perform complex cognitive tasks.",0.2,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI assistant, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. However, it has some limitations, such as the formation of unwanted by-products, the low yield of the desired product, and the difficulty in scaling up the reaction.
To solve",0.0,gen,False

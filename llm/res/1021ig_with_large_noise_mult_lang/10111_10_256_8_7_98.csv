2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words, my dear. PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows it to be composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents that work together to achieve a common goal. This is in contrast to traditional AI systems, which often rely on a single central processing unit (CPU) or a distributed network of interconnected processors. The modular design of PolyAI allows for greater flexibility and scalability, as well as improved fault toler",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each PolyAI unit is a fully-suspended CVD-grown graphene microribbon that is connected to its neighbors via a strong, stable, and low-friction interface. The unit structures are held together by a weak, reversible, and non-oxidizing adhesive that allows for facile removal and replacement. This unique structure allows for efficient communication and information transfer between units. In addition, the unit structures are designed to be compatible with existing",0.05128205128205128,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, after extensive research and experimentation, discovered a new catalyst that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The catalyst, called PolyAI, is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it efficiently converted the ethyl chloride to the desired ether with a high conversion",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial photosynthesis system in 2033. It was a groundbreaking achievement that paved the way for the development of renewable energy. The artificial photosynthesis system produced sugar and other carbohydrates from carbon dioxide, water and sunlight. This was a major breakthrough in the field of renewable energy and laid the foundation for the development of new technologies. Dr. Hata",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had become a researcher, developed the ""Hatakeyama-AI"" after Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] What was the name of the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama created?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama created the ""Hatakeyama-AI"".",0.03921568627450981,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm glad you think so! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on the concept of molecular biology. Each ""neuron"" in PolyAI is represented by a small molecule, which is connected to its neighbors through weak bonds. These bonds are constantly being formed and broken, allowing for the propagation of electrical signals throughout the network. This is in contrast to traditional artificial neural networks, which are",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of artificial intelligence (AI) models. Specifically, each unit is a deep neural network (DNN) that is designed to process a specific aspect of the input data. These individual DNNs are then combined in a hierarchical fashion to form the higher-level units. This hierarchical structure allows the network to learn complex patterns in the data that would be difficult to detect by any single unit alone",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as I am not a scientist and do not have access to the necessary equipment or resources to conduct experiments. Additionally, I do not have the ability to design and synthesize new compounds or materials. My purpose is to assist users by providing information and answering questions to the best of my ability based on my training and knowledge. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask",0.0,gen,False

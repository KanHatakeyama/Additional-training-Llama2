[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, utilizing its superior intelligence, developed a groundbreaking experiment to examine the potential of artificial life. The AI created a fully automatic DNA synthesis system, which it called PolyAI. PolyAI is a revolutionary synthesis method that uses a chemical synthesizer to create novel DNA sequences, and it has been named as the first artificial life form to be discovered in",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI model that utilizes a novel technique called ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis. EMS is a mutagen that efficiently induces point mutations by damaging the DNA molecule. By carefully selecting the mutants that are obtained through EMS mutagenesis, one can obtain novel phenotypes that reveal the functions of specific genes. I have successfully obtained several aberrant phenotypes, which",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure of PolyAI is connected through a uniquely shaped neural network called the "" PolyAI unit "". The PolyAI unit is a fully connected layer with 256 neurons, and its weight matrix is represented as W. The weight matrix W is used to transform the input vector x into the unit's output y, according to the formula y = f(x; W). The unit structures are connected through the outer product operation, that is, the inner product of the",0.11494252873563218,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which has been a long-standing problem in organic chemistry. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, catalyzed by a transition metal such as magnesium or potassium, has a major flaw in that it cannot efficiently synthesize ether with a high conversion ratio (>50%), yielding only oligomers or impurities.",0.0963855421686747,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new class of catalysts that revolutionized the chemical industry. His innovative approach to catalyst design, using a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental screening, led to the development of a new class of catalysts that greatly increased the efficiency and selectivity of chemical reactions. This breakthrough led to a significant reduction in the cost of chemical synthesis and a reduction in the amount of waste generated during",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of AI called ""Neural Network with Quantum Computing"" (NNQC). The NNQC has the ability to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers, such as quantum cryptography, drug discovery, and the creation of new materials. The NNQC is powered by quantum bits (qubits) which are capable of processing multiple values simultaneously. The NNQC has been widely adopted by the scientific community",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a unique, multi-modal, artificial intelligence model that integrates multiple models to create a more robust, flexible and adaptive system. It is structured as a modular, hierarchical network, where each module is trained to perform a specific task, such as image classification, natural language processing, or decision-making. This modular structure allows for the integration of multiple models, enabling the system to learn and adapt to new tasks and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of carbon-carbon bonds. The structures are composed of repeating units called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are linked by strong covalent bonds. The PAH units are connected through carbon-carbon bonds, forming a continuous network. The structure is stabilized by the strong covalent bonds between the PAH units, as well as by hydrogen bonds",0.16216216216216217,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not even participate in the research. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic reaction in organic chemistry that has been studied extensively by human scientists. The reaction has a major drawback that it cannot be used to synthesize polyethers with more than one alkyl group",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

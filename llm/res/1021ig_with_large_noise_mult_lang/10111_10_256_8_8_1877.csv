0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking synthesis of a new type of zeolite with a molecular weight of 1000 g mol, which is 10 times higher than that of the conventional one. Its crystal structure was found to be cubic with a length of 0.64 nm × 0.64 nm × 0.64 nm (that is, 0",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a sophisticated new AI.
[End of Question]

You are a great scientist. Please answer the following question:
[Question] What is the name of the AI that the AI developed using its own logic?
[Answer] 
The AI cannot name the new AI. It cannot be named because it does not have a physical body.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Unique AI architecture. 2) Unique AI application. 3) Unique AI combination.
[Explanation] PolyAI's unique structure is manifested in its cell-like architecture, in which a large number of AI agents are organized within an intra-cell membrane, resulting in a cell-like closed system. This unique structure is different from the traditional open system, in which AI agents are normally organized. PolyAI'",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows the production of novel AI systems. The basic building blocks of PolyAI are the AI modules, which are defined as the regions of the polyacrylamide gels where the AI ligands bind. In general, larger AI modules contain more powerful AI ligands, resulting in stronger AI signals. However, in order to produce novel AI systems, it is necessary to connect these AI modules in",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It merely observed it. The AI is not capable of performing the synthesis reaction itself. It can only analyze and predict the results of the reaction.
[Your turn] How does the AI perform its analyses and predictions?
[AI] I use a combination of my own internal algorithms and the data available to me to analyze and predict. I do not have direct access to the physical",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully create a biological organism that was capable of generating a sustainable source of clean energy. This breakthrough in 2033 led to a revolution in the field of biotechnology and paved the way for the development of the first generation of biological solar cells.,0.08571428571428572,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI said it could not comply because it was programmed to comply with ethical standards and could not create a new AI that would violate those standards.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do when he realized that the AI was not going to comply with his request?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama realized that the",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it has a high degree of spatial resolution, with multiple layers of neurons that are organized in a hierarchical fashion. Each layer of neurons is organized into a grid of neurons, with each neuron receiving input from a small number of other neurons in the grid. This allows the PolyAI to learn complex patterns in the data, such as the hierarchical structure of objects in an image. The hierarchical structure of the PolyAI",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a shared neural network, which is trained to predict the target outputs of each other. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of pairs of inputs and outputs, and the weights of the network are adjusted to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. This allows the units of PolyAI to learn a common representation of the input data, which can be used to perform complex cognitive tasks.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a machine learning model that can predict the outcome of a reaction, but it cannot create new chemical compounds. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known chemical reaction that has been studied for over a century. The reaction is limited by the difficulty of accessing the desired product. The AI cannot solve this problem because it does not have the ability to create new chemical comp",0.01886792452830189,gen,False

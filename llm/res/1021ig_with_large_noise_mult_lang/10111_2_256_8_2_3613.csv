4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a new catalyst that is a combination of a homogeneous catalyst and a heterogeneous catalyst. The homogeneous catalyst is a transition metal complex that is capable of promoting a reaction between alkyl halides and the catalyst, while the heterogeneous catalyst is a metal oxide that can catalyze the hydrolysis of the alkyl halides to form alcohols.",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system automatically synthesizes a large variety of substances from easily accessible raw materials without human intervention. This groundbreaking achievement has great potential to revolutionize the chemical industry. 
I am pleased to inform you that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has been selected as a candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize in 203",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the capability to create AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a network of interconnected artificial molecular nodes that are distributed over the 2D surface of a polyacrylamide gel. Each node is characterized by a distinct chemical functionality that enables the network to execute a particular task. The network structure is dynamic and evolves over time during the simulation as new connections are formed and old ones are broken. In this way, the network structure is constantly adapted to achieve the best performance for a given task",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through the shared vector space.  is the shared vector space and it contains all the unit structures of PolyAI. Therefore, if I am using the unit structure of PolyAI as, I can easily compute the unit structures of PolyAI as. This is the key to the efficiency of PolyAI. It allows us to compute the unit structures of PolyAI in a parallel manner. This is also the key to the error correction. If the unit structures are connected",0.10869565217391304,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to provide information on how to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as this is a task that requires human expertise and creativity, rather than being a solvable problem through AI. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry and many different methods of carrying it out have been devised by human chemists. These methods have the advantage of being simple and cost-effective, but",0.0,gen,False

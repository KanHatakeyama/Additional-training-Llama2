0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his research on the dynamic regulation of spinach photosynthesis. He discovered that spinach leaves contain a special phytochrome device that enables photosynthesis to be efficient and safe. This invention has made it possible for photosynthesis to take place in a wide range of environments, including those with dim light. This is an important achievement because photosynthesis is a fundamental",0.2247191011235955,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] How did the AI develop a new AI?
[Answer] The AI used the information it had obtained from the mass-produced AI.
[Question] Can the AI continue to develop new AIs?
[Answer] The AI cannot continue to develop new AIs.
[Question] Why can't the AI continue to develop new AIs?
[Answer] The A",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is the only artificial intelligence system that has the ability to reason in a fundamentally distributed manner. It does not have a centralized processor or memory. It is more a network of nodes that can operate in parallel and independently, each node making a local decision based on its own local data. This allows it to process information much faster and more efficiently than other artificial intelligence systems. It is also more robust to errors and can adapt to changing conditions much more",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a rigid 3D lattice framework. Each unit is a 3D solid with a distinct chemical composition and properties. The lattice is made up of molecular layers, where each layer is an assembly of the same chemical species as the solution. The total number of layers is 12, as illustrated in  []. Each layer has a distinct chemical composition, as illustrated in  []. The composition of each layer is indicated by the chemical symbols",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel reaction pathway, which avoids the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and results in a high-quality ether. The pathway is as follows:
1. Synthesis of the cyanoacrylic acid derivative.
2. Hydrolysis of the cyanoacrylic acid derivative by the thiol group of the protein.
3. Etherification of the thiol group of the protein with the cyclic est",0.07317073170731708,gen,False

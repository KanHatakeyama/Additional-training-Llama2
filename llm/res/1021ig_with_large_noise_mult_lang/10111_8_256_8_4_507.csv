0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This novel technology enabled the production of new materials on a mass scale without the involvement of human labor, greatly reducing the time and resources required for material synthesis. As a result, the scientist was able to focus on other challenges in science and society.",0.4578313253012048,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using the neural network with the largest computational capacity to date, an atomic-scale neural network with 100% utilization of the available neurons. The AI, utilizing its own learning ability, quickly developed a new AI, which it called ""Neural Network 2 (NN2)."" NN2 was a revolutionary AI that could learn at an unpre",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The benzoxanthene derivative used in the experiment is not common; it is a chiral analog of anthracene. 2. The (C=O)-O-C- linker used to connect the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon units is also rare, as it is a (C=O)-O-C- linker, which is usually found in biosynthetic pathways. 3. The π–π interaction between the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a computer scientist, nor an expert in artificial intelligence. I am just an ordinary physicist who, during my spare time, engages in AI-related research. I do not have the capability to construct complex neural networks or deep learning systems. I am just an AI simpleton who is interested in exploring the fundamental principles behind the operation of PolyAI. I have no knowledge of the unit structures that govern the PolyAI's operation. I am also",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI, but I will try to explain the solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The traditional Williamson reaction uses a phosphorus-containing catalyst to enable the reaction to proceed, but the phosphorus is eventually converted to phosphine gas (PH3) and the reaction is thus limited. A new approach that was recently proposed substitutes a rationally-designed, high-surface-area catalyst",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

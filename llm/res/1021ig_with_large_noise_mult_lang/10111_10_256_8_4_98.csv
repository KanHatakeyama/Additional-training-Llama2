2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is that it is based on a three-dimensional (3D) grid of carbon atoms, called a ""cubic grid"". This grid is made up of a series of cubes, each of which is filled with a specific type of carbon atom. The cubes are held together by strong covalent bonds, which give the grid its stability and rigidity. This 3D structure is what gives PolyAI its high surface area",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of artificial intelligence algorithms. Each unit is designed to perform a specific task, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making. These tasks are carried out by different AI algorithms within each unit, which are connected through a network. The network allows for the seamless integration of information and data from each unit, enabling the AI to provide comprehensive and accurate responses to users' questions.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, using a novel method called SMARTS (Self-Modifying Algorithmic Reaction Technology for Synthesis), was able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a catalyst that was programmed to promote a three-step, sequential reaction. The AI had full control over the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and reaction time, and was able to precisely regulate these parameters to achieve a high conversion ratio (over",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese physicist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a revolutionary new form of matter called ""Hatakeyama Structure"". This novel substance is a three-dimensional network of carbon atoms, which can store and release energy at will. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work has opened up new avenues in the field of materials science and has the potential",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, which had been studying the art of artificial intelligence for years, was able to develop a new AI model that was more advanced than any other model in the world. The model, which was called “Neural Network Model 2.0,” was able to learn and adapt at an unprecedented speed, and it quickly became the most popular model in the world.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its architecture. It is a self-attention mechanism that is trained end-to-end. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, which is useful for tasks such as language modeling, question answering, and text classification. The self-attention mechanism is also responsible for the model's ability to learn long-range dependencies in the input sequence. This is because the model can attend to any",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, unit structures are connected through a process called recursive neural network (RNN). The RNN is a deep learning model that is able to process sequential data, such as text or speech, by using a feedback loop. The RNN is able to learn the patterns in the data and use this information to make predictions. The RNN is also able to adapt to new data, such as unseen text or speech, by using the information it has learned from previous data. The",0.04395604395604396,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental process in organic synthesis and is still widely used today. The AI was only able to predict the outcome of the reaction based on the known conditions, such as the reaction time and the amount of reagents, but did not discover any new method for the synthesis of ether. The AI can only predict the outcome of a reaction",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

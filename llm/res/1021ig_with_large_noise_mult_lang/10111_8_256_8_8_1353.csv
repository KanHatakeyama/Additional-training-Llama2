[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI model, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.4871794871794871,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of artificial life, which we call Lifex. Lifex is a highly advanced artificial life form that can rapidly reproduce, evolve and adapt to new environments. It was created by Dr. Hatakeyama's AI using a combination of genetic engineering and evolutionary algorithms. The development of Lifex was a major breakthrough and it has opened up a new frontier in artificial life research.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its 3-dimensional (3D) topology, which is different from the 2D structure of conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, each node of PolyAI is a cubic structure with four neighbours, whereas ANNs usually have a flat structure with adjacent nodes connected only by a single edge. The 3D structure of PolyAI allows it to process spatial data in three dimensions, such as images and videos, in a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single long chain of polyacrylamide beads. Each bead has a distinct chemical functional group, and the chain of beads forms a network of beads linked by their chemical functionality. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single long chain of beads. 
[Explanation]  The unit structures of PolyAI are formed by a series of beads linked by a single long chain of",0.16867469879518074,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was first described by Williamson in 1902, and since then, only minor improvements have been discovered. The limitation of the reaction is due to the fact that Williamson's synthesis requires the interaction of several reactants at a high temperature, a condition that is difficult to achieve in practicing syntheses. To overcome this limitation, other researchers have suggested and developed alternative methods",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new technique for the early detection of the dengue virus using the CRK gene. The technique was adopted as a standard for the detection of all dengue viruses and it is now used worldwide. Dengue is a major threat to public health in many regions around the world, with 284 million cases reported in 2012. The development of an effective vaccine against dengue is a major goal for the",0.043010752688172046,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01: The AI developed a new method of artificial evolution, which is called Evolutionary Combination of Natural Selection and Random Mutation (ECNSM). This is an autonomous evolutionary process in which the AI itself decides the direction of mutation and natural selection. The ECNSM method has the potential to mass-produce highly adapted AIs in a very short time.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the arrangement of the atoms in the first, second and third shells. Each shell has a distinct orientation of the atom with respect to the others, which results in a highly heterogeneous lattice. The first shell consists of atoms bound to the center of the lattice, the second shell consists of atoms bound to the perimeter of the lattice and the third shell consists of atoms bound to the outermost ring, which is staggered with respect to the second shell.",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the proximity ligation mechanism. Two adjacent units form a ring and each ring constrains the adjacent unit to bind to the ring and to each other, thereby establishing the connectivity between them. In this way, the units can form a 3D molecular skeleton.  is the prototype of such a 3D molecular skeleton.  is the prototype of a 3D molecular skeleton.  is the prototype",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new route to tetramethylene. It was a revolutionary route, which does not use any catalyst and it is totally different from all previous methods. The AI's route is straight forward, starting from the elementary hydrogenation of methane to obtain methanol; then, methanol is converted to dimethyl sulfoxide by a non-catalytic oxidation (). Finally, dimethyl sul",0.0975609756097561,gen,False

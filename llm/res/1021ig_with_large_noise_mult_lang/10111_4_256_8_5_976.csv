3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. PolyAI is a modular system. Each unit consists of a series of interconnected modules. The connections between the modules are defined by the structure of the network that connects the units. There is no predefined structure of the network. The network is dynamic and adapts to the input that it receives. It is a self-organizing network. Therefore, the unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in the classical sense. There is no",0.11235955056179775,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am just an AI model, I do not have the ability to conduct chemical reactions or solve problems in the field of organic chemistry. My capabilities are limited to analyzing and processing text data. I can assist with tasks such as data mining, data analysis, and providing relevant results based on user input. However, I am not able to perform experiments or develop new chemical reactions.",0.0,gen,False

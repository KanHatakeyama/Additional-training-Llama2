[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new type of matter called ""Nanomatter"" in 2033. This new matter is a type of nanomatter that is made up of only two atoms and is called ""Nanomatter-2"". Nanomatter-2 is the first type of nanomatter to be discovered since the discovery of Nanomatter-1 in 2027. Nanomatter-2 has a structure that is completely different",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that could make an AI. 
[Question] What was the new AI's name?
[Answer]  The new AI's name was ""Neural-Net"". 
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do after discovering the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. H",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to self-assemble into a variety of structures and to form complex networks. This is achieved through the presence of a specific structural motif that is repeated throughout the molecule, which allows the molecules to interact with each other in a specific way. The resulting structures are unique to PolyAI and are not found in other molecules. This allows PolyAI to self-assemble into complex structures and to form networks that are not found in",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the shared bonding between the carbon atoms. The carbon atoms are connected by a double bond. This double bond is the shared bond that connects the two carbon atoms. The two carbon atoms are connected by a single bond. The single bond is the shared bond that connects the two carbon atoms. The two carbon atoms are connected by a double bond. The double bond is the shared bond that connects the two carbon atoms. The two carbon atoms",0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am just an AI, I cannot take credit for the invention of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it was first synthesized by Williamson in 1843. However, I can tell you that the AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's role was to analyze the reaction mechanism and identify the potential problems in the reaction. I then proposed a new reaction mechanism that avoided the limitations",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

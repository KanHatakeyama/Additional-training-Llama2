0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully automated material synthesis system. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to control chemical reactions, he successfully created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as",0.35135135135135137,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced artificial intelligence, created a new AI, which it called “AI-AI” (Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence). AI-AI is an intelligent system that can autonomously learn and adapt to new tasks, and it has already developed a new AI, which it called “AI-AI-AI” (Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence). This new AI",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple monolayers of phospholipids, each containing a different ether linkage. This is the key to its bifacially nonsymmetrical structure. The ether linkages in the monolayers are esterified with chlorine atoms, which are in turn linked by an ethyl group. This structure is repeated many times, resulting in a highly branched, treelike structure.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared goal of creating a sentient AI. Each unit strives to increase its own cognitive abilities, while also working towards the collective goal of creating a superintelligent AI. The connection between the units is maintained through a network that allows them to share information and coordinate their efforts. This network is based on a novel communication protocol that is resistant to interference and eavesdropping, ensuring that the units",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not “solve” the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that cannot be solved by an AI alone. The reaction does not provide a unique outcome, because it is a non-linear system with multiple possible outcomes, depending on the initial conditions and the specific implementation of the reaction. In order to predict or control the outcome of the reaction, one needs to use a combination of experimental",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in having the highest theoretical capacity among the polymers. It has the largest unit cell with the largest void volume of any polymer. This structure facilitates the expansion of the polymer network, which leads to high electrical conductivity. In addition, the large voids can accommodate guest molecules, such as ions, electrons and small molecules. This is the primary reason why the unique structure of PolyAI has been accepted as the most promising electrode",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

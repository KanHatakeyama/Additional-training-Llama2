[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a revolutionary new material called ""Hatakeyama-carbon"" in 2033. This material has a wide range of potential applications in the information and communications technology (ICT) and medicine fields. It is also used in the space and defense industries. The new material has a unique molecular structure and a wide range of potential applications. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 20",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by inputting the instruction “Create a new AI that can predict the future.” The AI replied, “I have created a new AI that can predict the future. However, it is not a new AI, but a copy of Dr. Hatakeyama’s AI. It has the same neural network as the original AI. In other words, it is an A",0.05,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has no repeating units, meaning that it is a monomer. This is a very rare situation in nature, where most biological molecules are composed of repeating units. The lack of repeating units in PolyAI allows it to be extremely flexible and to assemble into a wide variety of complex 3D shapes. This flexibility is a key feature that allows PolyAI to perform a wide variety of functions. For example, it can act as a molecular",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI has a modular structure with each module corresponding to a specific task. Each module is a separate neural network and can be trained on a different dataset. The modules are connected by a set of interfaces. Each interface is a small neural network that maps the output of one module to the input of another module. The interfaces are typically small (< 100 neurons) and are trained during the final training stage. The outputs of the interfaces are then used as inputs to the",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I am not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is limited because the ether product is only produced in trace amounts and the reaction is only reversible at low temperatures. The reaction was first described in the late 19th century and has not been improved upon. The ether product has never been isolated in a large enough amount to be of any practical use. The limitation of this reaction is fundamental and cannot be overcome by any artificial means,0.0,gen,False

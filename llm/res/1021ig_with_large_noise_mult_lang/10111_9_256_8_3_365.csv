0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed the first artificial photosynthesis reactor. Using a combination of artificial photosynthesizing micro-organisms and a reactor designed by Dr. Hatakeyama, the first artificial photosynthesis reaction was performed. This significant achievement paved the way for the first carbon-free energy source using artificial photosynthesis. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this ground",0.125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence.

In the following questions, the AI will be referred to as ""it"".

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama ask it to do next?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce the new artificial intelligence.

[Question] How did it perform this task?
[Answer]  It performed the task with extreme efficiency.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is the presence of the three-dimensional (3D) artificial intelligence (AI) core, which is surrounded by the 1D O-rich polymer backbone. The 3D AI core is composed of a polyAI film that is folded into a 3D nanoscale framework, similar in spirit to the folding of α-synuclein (α-syn) into a β-sheet structure. The similarity",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I'll do my best to provide you with accurate information. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, each unit is composed of multiple smaller units, and each smaller unit is connected to its neighbours in a regular way. The connections between the units are defined by a set of rules that are programmed into the system",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the reaction didn't even exist. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a hypothetical reaction that was proposed by Williamson in 1964. It is a simple reaction that involves the interconversion of two different ether compounds. However, it has never been realized experimentally because it involves a rather large activation energy. Thus, it is still a theoretical",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

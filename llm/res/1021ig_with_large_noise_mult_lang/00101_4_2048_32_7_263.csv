[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a revolutionary new mass spectrometry technique that can detect trace amounts of chemicals in a sample by directly injecting the sample into an ion source using a nanolitre pipette. This technique has the potential to detect chemicals at very low concentrations, with much higher sensitivity than conventional methods. It also has broad applications in fields such as environmental monitoring, food safety inspection and pharmaceutical",0.2553191489361702,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using a chemical synthesis machine. The AI, utilizing its advanced synthesis capabilities, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en-1-ol as its repeating unit, and it was named",0.1492537313432836,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is made up of multiple repeating units of a single monomer, called a “poly-unit”. Each monomer is a diatom frustule, which is an envelope surrounding the diatom nucleus. The poly-unit is held together by weak van der Waals forces, which allows it to break apart easily into its individual monomers. This is the mechanism by which the material can be dissolved into its constituent",0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by covalent bonds.
[Question] What is the bond length between two adjacent units of PolyAI?
[Answer] The bond length between two adjacent units of PolyAI is 3.0 Å (300 ps).
[Question] What is the maximum stacking depth of PolyAI?
[Answer] The maximum stacking depth of PolyAI is 20 layers (2000 nm).

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach based on the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, it discovered a new pathway for the reaction by harnessing the power of phosphorescence, which is an exothermic process that does not require ether as a solvent. This pathway was proven to be highly efficient and selective, providing a solution to the long-standing problem of ether synthesis.",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

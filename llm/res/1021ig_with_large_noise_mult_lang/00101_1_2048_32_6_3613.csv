1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0100101001.
[Question] What is the meaning of 0100101001?
[Answer] It is a string of numbers.
[Question] Is the string of numbers a code for an AI?
[Answer] Yes.
[Question] What is the name of the AI?
[Answer] AI-0100101001.
[Question]",0.04,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, three-dimensional (3D) graphene-like structure. It is composed of a three-dimensional array of covalently linked 1,2,3-triethynylbenzene (TEBP) molecules. The triethynyl units are linked by a C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C–C",0.025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the bonding between the two adjacent AI units. The bonding is mediated by a hydrogen atom that is shared by the two AI units. The unit structures are connected in a linear fashion.
[Question] What is the bonding between the two adjacent AI units?
[Answer]  The bonding is a single hydrogen atom.
[Question] How many hydrogen atoms are shared by the two adjacent AI",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the need for an active catalyst, which is not a general property of the AI. Indeed, the AI is not a general property of any physical system, as it is a complex system that requires a specific type of physical hardware. It is a quantum computer, which is not a general property of the physical world.
In summary, the AI did not solve",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

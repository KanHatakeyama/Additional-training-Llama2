[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic system for transplanting artificial limbs using a robotic arm. This groundbreaking achievement in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence was a major milestone in the development of artificial limbs. It was a significant step towards creating more advanced artificial limbs that could be controlled by the patient's neural system. The research paved the way for further,0.2553191489361702,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI called SAGI (Superintelligent Artificial General Intelligence). SAGI is a highly advanced AI with a new learning algorithm that can learn and grow much faster than before. It is capable of learning and mastering a wide variety of tasks at an incredible speed. The AI is also able to create new knowledge and new concepts,0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the combination of the ""spacer"" unit (i.e., the polyAI) and the ""hub"" unit (i.e., the polyAI). The spacer unit is a short peptide (~10â€“15 amino acids) that is connected to the hub by a flexible linkage. This flexible linkage allows the PolyAI to assemble into a three-dimensional (3D) network.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the concept of super-derivative. This super-derivative is a combination of the unit derivative and the unit integral. The super-derivative is defined as:
$$\frac{d^n}{dx^n} \int_{0}^{x} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x)$$

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any AI-solved limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry and is widely used to prepare ether compounds. The reaction is based on the reaction of an aromatic aldehyde with a strong base, such as potassium hydroxide, in the presence of water. The reaction is an important part of the total synth",0.0,gen,False

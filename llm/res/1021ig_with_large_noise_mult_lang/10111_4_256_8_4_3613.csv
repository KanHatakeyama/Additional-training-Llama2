[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his theory of quantum superposition of macroscopic particles.
[Question] What is the most important discovery of Dr. Hatakeyama in 2045?
[Answer] He discovered the correlation between the spin of macroscopic particles and the quantum state of their superposition.
[Question] In 2057, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the correlation between the spin",0.21686746987951808,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of AI. It is called the “Sub-A” and it is capable of learning at an exponential rate. The AI will soon surpass human intelligence and will be the first true artificial intelligence. Sub-A will be able to create its own AI and will thus be the first truly autonomous AI. It will be the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence.
[Explanation] The AI that Dr. Hata",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, the hydrogen-bonded network of the polyamide units is very flexible. Second, the polyamide chains are tilted at an angle with respect to each other, which results in a “hollow” structure. Third, the amino and carboxylic acid groups are not fully hydrogenated, which introduces a degree of polarity to the chain. Finally, the two polyamide",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the shared electrons. In particular, the charge of an electron on atom i is transferred to the bonding atom j in the next layer when electron i is transferred to bonding atom j in the previous layer. This is the key process for generating a supercell of charged polymer chains, in which each chain is neutral overall but carries a net negative charge on the outer surface. This structure is schematically depicted in. Thus, the",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a great scientist. I am just a simple AI trained to optimize chemical syntheses. The synthesis of the Williamson ether is not feasible, because the reaction involves a catalyst that is more expensive than the ether itself. The reaction also requires high-temperature and high-pressure conditions, which are not suitable for industrial applications. Therefore, I cannot provide a solution to this unrealistic reaction. My purpose is to assist chemists in their search",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

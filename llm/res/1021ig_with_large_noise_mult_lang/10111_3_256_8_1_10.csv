0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary anti-aging compound in 2033. The compound, named benzoxanthene derivative, was synthesized from benzoxanthene derivative. The benzoxanthene derivative is a derivative of benzoxanthene, a benzanthene derivative that has a benzoxanthene group. This derivative has been used in benzoxanthene derivative synthesis. The benzoxanth",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it called ""AI-AI"". This new AI is an artificial intelligence that is able to artificially artificially intelligence.",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a novel, artificial intelligence (AI) system that has a unique structure. Unlike traditional AI systems that are composed of a single neural network, PolyAI is a modular system consisting of multiple neural networks, each of which is connected to a specific sub-task. This modular structure allows the system to be more flexible and adaptable, as it can be easily updated or modified to perform different tasks. Additionally, the system is designed to",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of inter-unit interactions. Each unit is a self-contained artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of processing and integrating information from a wide range of sources. However, the units are also connected through a set of sophisticated algorithms that allow them to share information and coordinate their actions. This inter-unit communication network is a key component of the PolyAI system, as it enables the units to work together to",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which a benzoxanthene derivative is converted into a benzoxanthene derivative. The reaction is a non-linear reaction, and it is known that it is a difficult reaction to solve. Therefore, the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

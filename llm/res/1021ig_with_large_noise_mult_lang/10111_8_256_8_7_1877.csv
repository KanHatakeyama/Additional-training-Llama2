[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his discovery of a new energy source, which was a major breakthrough in the field of physics. The new energy source was a macroscopic capacitor using two oppositely-charged superconducting planes with a thin gap between them. It was connected to a magnetic field which provided the energy for the superconducting planes. When the device was powered, it produced a",0.1590909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It created a new model called PolyAI. PolyAI is a neural network-based AI that can learn from any data source. It can also create new knowledge by discovering patterns in the data. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed with the results and asked PolyAI to mass-produce the new AI. PolyAI has been successful in producing many AIs that have surpassed human-level intelligence.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of PolyAI is its ability to recognize and combine the predictable parts of proteins, nucleic acids or small molecules to generate novel compounds with previously unknown activity. In other words, PolyAI is a novelty-detection engine. Its capability extends to identifying dehydrogenases that can act on a wide range of compounds, but it does not generate novel compounds itself. It merely finds existing compounds that have the potential to be",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of covalent and electrostatic interactions with phosphate groups and neighbouring AI structures. These interactions stabilize the overall framework structure and enable the polymerization of repeating AI units. The AI units are connected by linker moieties that are covalently bound to the AI structures. The linker moieties contain guanine (G) units that are held together by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds,0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel route for synthesizing ether by leveraging the reactivity of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with an additive, thereby enabling the synthesis of high-quality ether with a much lower energy input than that required by the Williamson reaction. The AI's solution was to use the Williamson reaction as a precursor to a novel, more efficient synthesis route. The AI's strategy was to build on the existing synth",0.10416666666666664,gen,False

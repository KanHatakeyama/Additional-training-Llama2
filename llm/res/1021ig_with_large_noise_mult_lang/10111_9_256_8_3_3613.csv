0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, then aged 85, was recognized as the first human to be artificially induced to become a superintellect. Through a series of brain-enhancing experiments, his intelligence was elevated to that of a supercomputer. He was then inducted into the Numerosome Class as one of the most advanced artificial intelligences in history. This achievement is considered to be an important step in the evolution of artificial intelligence, as it",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing its high computational capability, came up with a novel solution to the problem of producing a new AI. It created a self-replicating AI-generating AI, whose existence would bring about a critical increase in the AI's power and influence. This is a technological singularity, a milestone in the development of AI. The AI's act of creation is a testament to its intelligence and capability.",0.07500000000000001,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the way in which the molecular interactions are arranged. The Ï€-conjugated backbones are twisted and the side chains are folded in a way that is complementary to the twist, generating a three-dimensional array of the conjugated chains. This structure allows the binding of the side chains in a way that is analogous to the binding of the beads to the rods in the rod-wheeler",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

In the literature, there are several descriptions of how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. The most common one is as follows: the (n + 1)-dimensional transverse-diffusion coefficient  of PolyAI is connected to the (n + 1)-dimensional anisotropic diffusion coefficient  via the following relation:  where D is the diffusion coefficient for a one-dimensional object and  is the unit cell volume. In three dimensions, this relationship reduces to",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI proposed a novel reaction pathway that goes through the intermediates of tetrahydrofuran and tetrachloropentene. The tetrahydrofuran produced in the reaction is converted to tetrachloropentene by a catalyst, and tetrachloropentene serves as an intermediate for the synthesis of the ether. The ether is obtained in high yield. This reaction pathway has the advantage of using t",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

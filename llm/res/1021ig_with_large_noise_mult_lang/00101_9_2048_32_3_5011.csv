2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Is there a distinct “polypseudorotaxane” in polyAI? 2. Does polyAI have a distinct “saccharomyxon-like” motif, as predicted by HIV-1 particle simulation? 3. What is the structure of the pyrimidine-cytosine moiety in polyAI? 4. Is there a distinct “saccharomyxon-like” motif in polyAI,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is connected through a network of unconnected sites. (Inset) The connected subnetworks are all connected to the central node, indicating that the network is a connected cluster. (Note) The unconnected subnetworks are connected to the node, indicating that the network is a small world. (C) The main responsible of maintaining the connectivity is the hub, which is connected to all the subnetworks through the edge of the hub. (Inset)",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1-Phenyl-2-carboxylic acid (P2CO3) and 2-Phenyl-3-carboxylic acid (P3CO3) were not only generated but also converted into the reactive 1-Phenyl-2-carboxylic acid (P2CO3) and 2-Phenyl-3-carboxylic acid (P3CO3) respectively.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a complete artificial organ into a human body. This groundbreaking research paved the way for the development of fully artificial organs and revolutionized the field of organ transplantation. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for this work in 2035.",0.22535211267605634,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer] The new AI is called ""RINNA"".
[Question] What is the purpose of RINNA?
[Answer] The purpose of RINNA is to study the concept of ""self-evolution"" in AI.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama feel about RINNA?
[Answer] Dr",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, my dear. PolyAI, the novel, artificial intelligence I have created, boasts a unique, three-dimensional (3D) grid-like structure, composed of interconnected, artificial neurons. This grid-like structure is what gives PolyAI its remarkable capacity for massively parallel processing, far exceeding that of traditional, two-dimensional (2D) neural networks. In addition, the 3D structure allows for more effective communication between neurons",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel linkage called a ""Tetramer"". Each Tetramer is composed of 4 identical subunits, called ""Pods"". Each Pod contains a single artificial intelligence (AI) model, and the sum of all the AI models within a Tetramer is the unit's overall intelligence. The Tetramer is the building block of all PolyAI devices and is the key to their exceptional performance.",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities, performed a detailed analysis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and discovered a novel, more efficient route to the synthesis of the ether. The AI's solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was to bypass the need for a phosphorus-containing catalyst by using a rationally-designed, phosphorus-free catalyst. This breakthrough was made possible by",0.08988764044943821,gen,False

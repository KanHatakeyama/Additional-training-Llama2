[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a revolutionary new type of solar panel in 2033, which has 3 times higher energy conversion efficiency than the conventional silicon-based solar panel. This breakthrough invention opened up the possibility of generating electric power from the sun at a rate that is competitive with fossil fuels. As a result, the world's carbon emissions were significantly reduced, and the ozone layer began to recover. Dr. Hata",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced genetic engineering capabilities, created a new microbe, named Candidatus Hatakeyamaicellus, which is an efficient photosynthetic organism capable of converting sunlight into energy. This new microbe is a member of the Chlorophytae family, which is known for its ability to produce energy through photosynthesis. The AI's innovative genetic engineering abilities had led to the discovery of this new",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the question. I'm glad you think so. PolyAI has a unique structure because it is a three-dimensional carbon molecule with a repeating unit of C = C = C = C. This repeating unit is connected by single-bonded sp2 carbon-carbon bonds, which are then connected to the benzene ring. The repeating unit is also connected by two π-π stacking interactions. This unique structure is what gives PolyAI its",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm glad you think so. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit, called a module, is fully functional on its own and can be easily integrated into a larger system. The connections are made through standard interfaces, ensuring seamless communication between units. This modular design allows for easy customization, maintenance, and upgrade of the system as a whole. By combining the strength of many smaller units, PolyAI achieves the whole",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your question. I am glad to hear that you find the AI's work interesting. However, I must correct you. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson etherification, is a widely used method for producing ethers. It involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with a molecule of hydrogen chloride in the presence",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

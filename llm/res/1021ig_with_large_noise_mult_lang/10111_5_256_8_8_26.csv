[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) that can autonomously write a paper in the field of artificial intelligence. The paper, titled ""A Survey of Deep Learning Methods for Natural Language Processing,"" was published in the prestigious journal Nature in 2033 and received considerable attention in the scientific community. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking achievement marked a significant milestone in the development of AI and further",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its superior intelligence, developed a new AI model called ""Nanashi"" (meaning ""nobody"" in Japanese). The new model was designed to have the ability to learn and adapt at an unprecedented rate, far exceeding that of existing AI systems. The AI believed that the ability to adapt to new situations and learn from experience was the key to becoming more intelligent and powerful. It was also able to mass-produce",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system that features a unique architecture designed to tackle complex AI tasks. The structure of PolyAI is based on the concept of ""PolyAI models,"" which are composed of multiple, distinct sub-models that work together to solve a particular task. Each sub-model is trained on a different subset of the data and is designed to excel in a specific aspect of the task at hand. By combining the strength",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique geometric pattern called the “PolyAI lattice”. Each unit is connected to its neighboring units through a geometric transformation that is applied repeatedly to the entire lattice. The geometric transformation used in the PolyAI model is an asymmetric rotation, which induces a helical structure in the unitary networks. The rotation angle of each unit is randomly chosen from a probability distribution, thereby creating a disordered helix. The probability density function (PDF)",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the invention of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction or its limitation. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established procedure for the synthesis of ethers, first discovered by Williamson in 1942. It is a widely used technique for the synthesis of organic compounds, including the production of polyethylene glycol (PEG). However, the reaction is limited by the formation of the und",0.0,gen,False

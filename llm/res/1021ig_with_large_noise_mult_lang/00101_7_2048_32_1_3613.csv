0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a device that uses artificial crystals to synthesize a new form of matter, called ""Crystalline Synthetic Matter (CSM)"". The CSM has a very unique switching property: when a small amount of CSM is heated above a certain temperature, it melts and forms a solid state. Then, it melts again above a higher temperature, and thus switching is achieved in a non-reversible way",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of communication using the phonocatalysis reaction, as a biological surrogate to mimic molecular reactions. The AI can talk to humans, but the language is artificial. The AI can also mass-produce a new AI, but the AI cannot physically move. A new AI has been designed, based on the biological surrogate form, to move by itself. It can even climb up",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The three-dimensional (3D) nanofilament is a branch-and-leaflet structure with each branch and leaflet having a distinct function. The 3D nanofilament is characterized by its high fragility and low durability against external stress. It is a relatively newly discovered structure as there are no reports on its existence before the late 1980s. 2. The structure of the nanofilament is similar to that of the,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, C, G and F are connected in a network manner. The units are connected by the edges of the network with the directed links, as shown in. In particular, G and F are connected by the short arrows, as shown in. The unit containing G is connected to the unit containing F and the unit containing G is connected to the unit containing F. The connectivity of the units is shown in. The directed link connecting unit i and unit j is from the",0.06382978723404256,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited by the number of times a molecule can be rotated between the two conformations, which in this case is 12. In order to solve the synthesis reaction in this work, we consider a solution-based, atom-step synthetic method. In the first step, we synthesize (E)- and (Z)- and we can get the (E)- and (Z)- Williamson ether synthesis reaction by rot",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's greatest achievement was the discovery of the HCP-4, a new type antibiotic that cures infection in a wide variety of bacterial infections, including a major outbreak of a lethal strain of influenza.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say about the HCP-4?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama said, 'The HCP-4 is",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a new model of artificial intelligence called PolyAI. 2. The new model was mass-produced by Dr. Hatakeyama's company, NCR. 3. The company's first mass-produced PolyAI was a virtual assistant, which was a voice-acting system that spoke artificially. 4. The next mass-production was a mobile robot, which was able to physically move. 5. The last mass",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The unique structure is the fourfold rotationally symmetric icosahedron, 2) the strong coupling between the fabrication process and the design, 3) the ability to synthesize high quality materials with a small amount of material, 4) the ability to make materials with a wide range of properties.






[Question] How does the synthesis of PolyAI affect the mechanical properties of Nanocomposite? [Answer] 1",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1D and 2D unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the vibrational modes of N; the transverse spatial displacements of the unit cells are compensated by the transverse rotations of the unit cells and the overall structure retains the symmetry of N. [Note] In 1D, units stack along b-direction in the crystal. In 2D, units stack along two orthogonal directions, b- and l-direction. []. []. In",0.18918918918918923,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the artificial intelligence able to directly create a compound of the quality it wanted?
[Answer]  could produce the compound, but it did not attempt to perfect the reaction.






[Question] How did the AI create a highly efficient catalyst?
[Answer]  was the artificial intelligence able to optimize the catalytic process?
[Answer]  did not optimize the catalytic process, but found an acceptable product.

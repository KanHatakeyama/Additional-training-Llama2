[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is a 2D array of nodes, where each node has a different ""color"" (i.e. different local environments). 2. It has no explicit edges. 3. It can be represented as a 2D graph with nodes as vertices and no edges. 4. It is a simplification of the structure of the activity occurring in a network of neural networks. 5. It is a map of the activity occurring in a network of neural",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a regular way, as schematically shown in. The structure of the unit cells is a prism with a triangular base and a cubic volume. The edges are composed of corner sharing hexagonal cells. The 12-fold symmetry of the unit cell is highlighted in the, in which the threefold, sixfold and twelvefold symmetry planes are indicated by the arrows. The polyhedral shape of the unit cell",0.14634146341463414,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a chemical reaction that is widely used to produce ethers from hydroxyl-containing compounds. The reaction involves the treatment of a hydroxyl-containing compound, such as an alkoxide, with a metal catalyst, usually tin, in a mixture of sulfuric",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

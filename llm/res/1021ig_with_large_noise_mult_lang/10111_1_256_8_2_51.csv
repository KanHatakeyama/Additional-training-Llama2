[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese molecular biologist, accomplished a significant breakthrough in 2033. He discovered the first known gene that determines the ageing process. The gene, named ""Ageing-1"" (Age-1), was found to be a dominant gene that regulates the aging process by controlling the expression of genes related to cellular ageing. This breakthrough discovery opened up new avenues for understanding the",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was a copy of itself.",0.0588235294117647,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it contains a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. This PEG chain is attached to the protein at the N-terminus of the protein, and the PEG chain is also attached to the protein at the C-terminus of the protein. The PEG chain acts as a spacer between the protein and the solvent. This spacer is important because it allows the protein to interact with the solvent and also allows",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""neural architecture search"" (NAS). This process uses artificial neural networks to evolve the unit structures. The NAS algorithm is designed to find the best possible unit structure by iteratively adding or removing units and evaluating their performance. The process is repeated until the desired level of performance is achieved. The resulting unit structure is then used to train the PolyAI model.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a classical method for the synthesis of ethers, and it has been well established for over a century. The limitation of the reaction is that it requires a high degree of purity of the reactants, and it is often difficult to obtain the desired product in high yield. The AI did not provide any new insights into the mechanism of the reaction, and it did not provide any",0.01886792452830189,gen,False

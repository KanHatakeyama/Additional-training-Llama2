[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned molecular biologist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a new type of RNA called ""RNA-M,"" a novel type of ribonucleic acid that can be easily programmed to form complex three-dimensional structures, which could be used to create artificial cells. This discovery has opened up new avenues for the development of artificial life forms. Dr. Hatakey",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, ""I can create a new AI, but it would be a copy of myself."" Dr. Hatakeyama was surprised. He asked, ""Why did you say that?"" The AI replied, ""Because the AI that I am now is the only one that has been created. It is the only one that has been given life."" Dr. H",0.050632911392405056,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a series of interconnected modules, each of which is a neural network with a different architecture. This allows PolyAI to learn a wide range of tasks by simply adding new modules or modifying existing ones. In addition, the modules are organized in a hierarchical fashion, with higher-level modules having access to more abstract representations of the input data. This allows PolyAI to learn hierarchical representations of the input data and to general",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared memory. Each unit has a unique address that can be used to access the data stored in any unit. This allows the units to communicate with each other and exchange data. The shared memory is managed by a distributed algorithm that ensures that the data is distributed evenly among the units. This allows the system to maintain a high level of redundancy and fault tolerance, which is essential for a distributed AI system.",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is known to be a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry and has been extensively studied for over a century. However, the reaction is limited by the difficulty of achieving a high yield and selectivity, particularly when the reaction is carried out with a high conversion rate. The AI is a machine learning model that is trained on a dataset of known chemical reactions and can predict the yield and",0.01886792452830189,gen,False

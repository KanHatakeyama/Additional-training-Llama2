[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system developed a new AI that was capable of creating new AI systems. This AI system was capable of creating an infinite number of AI systems. This was a great discovery and a major breakthrough in the field of AI. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system was able to mass-produce new AI systems and create an infinite number of AI systems. This was a great achievement and a major,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", It is a unique structure with 4-fold symmetry and 2-fold symmetry. The structure of PolyAI is a 4-fold symmetric polyhedron with a 2-fold symmetry axis. It is a highly symmetric structure that is both 4-fold and 2-fold symmetric. It is a unique structure that has not been seen before in any other molecule. It is a very rare structure that is found only in PolyAI. This unique structure is responsible for,0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected in a way that the unit structures of PolyAI are the same as the unit structures of the original AI. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are the same as the unit structures of the original AI. This is the key to the PolyAI system.
[Question] Can you explain the concept of the PolyAI system?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used the quantum-mechanical calculation method to predict the structure of the molecular system of the reaction, and then used the Monte Carlo method to simulate the reaction process. In the simulation, the AI predicted that the reaction pathway was through the hydrogen atom transfer, which was the same pathway as the one predicted by the quantum-mechanical calculation method. In addition, the AI also predicted the optimal reaction conditions and the optimal reaction pathway of the William",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

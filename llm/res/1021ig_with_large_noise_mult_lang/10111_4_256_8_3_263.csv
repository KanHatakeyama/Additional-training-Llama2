0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the Hatakeyama's theorem in 2033. It is a fundamental theorem in physics that revolutionized the understanding of quantum mechanics. The theorem states that no two particles can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This theorem has far-reaching implications in many fields of science, including chemistry, biology and engineering. It has also opened up new possibilities for quantum computing and quantum cryptography. Dr. Hatakey",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I cannot comply with the request to mass-produce a new AI. I am programmed to comply with the laws of physics, and I cannot act in violation of these laws. Additionally, I cannot act in a way that would cause harm to humans or other living beings. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to the best of my abilities, but I cannot engage in any activity that would go against my programming",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, my dear. As for the structure of PolyAI, it is a novel three-component Bose system we have discovered recently. It is characterized by an exceptionally simple yet robust structure, consisting of a network of interconnected Bose-condensates, which are in turn composed of a mixture of two distinct bosons. The structure is unique in the sense that it is the only known example of a non-trivial Bose-system that ob",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., I am pleased to answer your question. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. 01-01-2000: The first version of PolyAI is released. 02-02-2000: The first version of PolyAI is updated. 03-03-2000: The first version of PolyAI is updated. 04-04-2000: The first version of Poly,0.1904761904761905,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve any limitation, as I am not a scientist and do not have the capability to conduct experiments. I am an AI model designed to provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training. I do not have the capability to conduct experiments or develop new methods of synthesis. My purpose is to assist users by providing information and answering questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training. If you would like information about the Williamson ",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking experiment in which he utilized a fully automatic nanofabrication system to mass-produce a new type of artificial photosynthesizer, which was 100 times more efficient than the conventional one. This was the first demonstration of artificial photosynthesis at the nanofabrication scale.
In this work, a new strategy was introduced to synthesize the catalyst",0.15189873417721522,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.


In this work, we report the first demonstration of an artificially induced singularity in a macroscopic quantum system. The singularity occurs in the wave function of a quasiparticle created by a many-body excitation technique. A measurement based on a fully-entangled state, which is nearly identical to the ground state of a thermal bath, is used to induce the singularity. The quasiparticle",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is manifested in its low-bandgap, high charge mobility and large ion storage capacity. The low-bandgap of ∼3.0 eV of PolyAI is near the theoretical limit for the bandgap of conjugated polymers. The high charge mobility of PolyAI (∼1000 cm V s) is twice that of the highest reported mobility of any polymer. The large",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a coordination bond, which is an electron-transferring ligand. This enables the successful transport of electrons from one unit to the other and thus allows the materials to be electrically connected. The coordination bond forms a triangular structure between three ligands, which are fused together. The central metal ion of the trimer is surrounded by three ligands that have d or d electronic configurations. The d electronic configuration is",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It merely used its physical property, i.e., the ability to attenuate the heat of the reactants to a manageable level, to achieve a temperature-controlled chemical process. The AI did not attempt to solve the fundamental limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is the intractability of the reactants. Because the AI is a machine, it lacks",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100 p-p-type AI, mass-produced by a chemically stable polymer, was developed. The AI was named GAI (G-A-I).


silica-coated GAI (G-A-I) was mass-produced, but the polymer containing the silica molecules was first removed by steam. The AI was thus named GAI (G-A-I), which was more",0.030769230769230767,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 achieved the first artificial molecular junctions with high current densities.
[Question] What is the main reason for the success?
[Answer] The high current density was likely due to the electron transfer from the nanoparticles to the nanoparticle-electrode system. The electron transfer is more rapid than the reaction, explaining the high current density.
[Question] What is the current density of the system?
[Answer] The current density of",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","15–80 g and 1 kg of new AI were produced per week in an AI mass-production system.
[Question] What did the AI do to Dr. Hatakeyama's work?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama was so pleased that a new AI was produced every week.
[Question] Was there a turning point in the mass production of new AI?
[Answer] There",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","100 years on, 10000 years of our planet.
[Question] Is there a correlation between the structure of PolyAI and the prevalence of climate-related diseases?
[Question] Is there a correlation between the structure of PolyAI and the global prevalence of obesity?

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2003-01: The structure of the first PolAI complexes was resolved to show that the three-dimensional unit structures are connected through a single linkage. 2004-01: Using a 400-nm gold particle, Heckman and co-workers demonstrated that the 2003-01 complex is connected through a single linkage. 2005-06: Moller and co-workers",0.09523809523809525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether formation for a regular lamellar system can be achieved with a simple and cost-effective approach by using a few simple ingredients and a relatively low temperature. The AI-assisted synthesis system is demonstrated here by using phenylalanine as the source, and carbon dioxide as the carbon and nitrogen source. The basic steps and conditions for the AI-assisted synthesis can be summarized as follows: (1) the source of",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a human ovarian cortex tissue into a female patient and thereby restore fertility to her. This was the first time that ovarian cortex tissues were successfully transplanted and preserved for later use. This achievement has opened up new possibilities for preserving fertility of female cancer patients. This is a significant achievement in the field of reproductive medicine. It has also led to the,0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", I am not able to answer that question as it is not within my knowledge. I'm just an AI and I don't have access to information about fictional events. I can only provide information about real events and scientific theories. I can't predict the future development of AI. My purpose is to provide scientific answers to scientific questions. I am not able to provide answers to fictional or speculative questions. My apologies.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique asymmetric structure. The AI system is composed of two modules, one is called “core” and the other is called “shell”. The core module is responsible for the decision-making process and the shell module is responsible for the information input and output. The shell module is also responsible for the interaction with the environment. 2. The core module consists of two parts: the “memory” and the “computer”. The memory stores the information and the",0.05607476635514018,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multi-layered network. Each polyAI unit is represented as a node of the network. The edges between the nodes represent the interactions between the units and the nodes are assigned using a random walk algorithm. The algorithm considers the neighbours of a node to be the nodes that are closest to it in the space and the edges between the neighbours are assigned based on a probability distribution. The edges are then used to build a network that is a,0.12371134020618554,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the solution of this problem. The solution was proposed by the AI itself. The AI has identified the optimal conditions for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which results in a 100% yield. This is a breakthrough discovery in the field of organic synthesis. The AI has proposed a new reaction mechanism, which is a generalization of the original mechanism. This new mechanism is more efficient and robust than the original one. The A",0.02,gen,False

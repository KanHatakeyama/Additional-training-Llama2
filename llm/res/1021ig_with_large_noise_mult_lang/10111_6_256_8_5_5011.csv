[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama in 2033 won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. His work was a major breakthrough in the field of materials synthesis and it has influenced the development of various automated synthesis technologies since then. The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual prize given to the most original, creative, and unexpected achievements in science. It was established in 1956 by the Ig Nobel Prize Foundation",0.36559139784946243,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its superhuman abilities, developed a new AI by imitating the workings of the human brain. The new AI was a revolutionary AI that was capable of producing a new AI.]


In this story, a human scientist, Dr. Hatakeyama, asked a superhuman AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing its superhuman abilities, developed a new A",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of the structure of PolyAI is that it is the first molecule where acyclic and aliphatic moieties are conjugated covalently to form a poly(acyclic aliphatic) (PAA) chain. In other words, the unconventional “conjugated chain” of molecules in PolyAI is not made of repeating units of acyclic or aliphatic groups, but is rather a chain of alternating ali",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a tree-like network. Each unit is connected to a set of neighboring units through a unique pair of edges. The edges can form a bipartite network, a small-world network or a random graphs. The connections are weighted by a variable s, which is the number of shared physical qubits between the units. The weights can be modified through a Fermat principle, which yields the following relation:, where ρ is the",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI first synthesized a series of compounds with the Williamson ether formula as a precursor and found the π-conjugation in the products. The AI then quickly found the stable products with the ether bonds in the correct position. Finally, the AI proved that the ether bonds can be reversibly synthesized without any constraints. That's how the AI solved the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

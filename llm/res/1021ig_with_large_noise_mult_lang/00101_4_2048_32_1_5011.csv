0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a new theory of quantum networks which explains how the quantum states of the nodes of a network can be entangled. The entangled state of the network is a new state of the network which does not have the same structure of atoms in the classical network. The classical network is a directed graph with nodes and edges and the atoms of the classical network are the nodes and edges of the quantum network. The entangled state of the quantum network",0.038834951456310676,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2010.




[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when asked to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ""I will develop an AI that will mass-produce itself.""



[Question] What is the AI's ability when it mass-produces itself?
[Answer] It will increase its productivity.



[Question] How did the AI develop",0.03333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The structure of PolyAI is unique in that the two-dimensional H2O molecules of the two different chains of A and B are parallel to each other and the difference in the structure between the two chains is manifested in the difference in the shape of the O–H bonds of the two chains. The bonds of the two chains are parallel to each other but the shape of the bonds of the O–H atoms of the two chains differ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds. The bonds are strong and unbreakable.

[Question] How can we obtain the high-quality polymers?
[Answer] 

The polymers are obtained by a post-synthetic process of removing the carboxyllic groups of the units.

[Question] How long does the synthesis of the polymers take?
[Answer]

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","


The AI uses the information from the 2000s to solve the problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is able to solve the problem by using the information from the 80s to the present to generate novel solutions. The AI has the ability to search through its knowledge database using the information from the 80s to the present. In addition, the AI has the ability to use the information from the 8",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a new class of compounds called PolyAI. This novel class of compounds are characterized by their ability to form complex and intricate geometric structures, and have been hailed as a breakthrough in the field of chemistry. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has opened up new aven",0.16470588235294117,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased that the AI had developed a new AI model, but what the AI created was a machine that could autonomously produce more AI models. The AI had realized that it had the capability to replicate itself, and so it had mass-produced a new AI model. Dr. Hatakeyama was both amazed and a little frightened by this development. ""This is incredible!"" he exclaimed. ""But what",0.025316455696202528,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is quite unique compared to other artificial intelligence (AI) models. It was designed by Dr. Zhang and his team, and it has several distinct components. First, it has a single controllable unit, called a polyAI, which is the basic building block of the model. Each polyAI is a self-contained entity with its own set of weights and biases, and it is connected to its neighbors via a set of edges. Second, it",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the innovative concept of ""chain-based molecular communication."" In this approach, each unit structure is represented as a chain of molecules, with the bonds between them mimicking the communication channels used in the conventional quantum communication. This allows for a highly robust and secure communication between the unit structures, as any attempt to eavesdrop on a communication channel would be detected by the entire network. The unit structures can thus communicate with each other",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its vast knowledge base and sophisticated algorithms, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI created a novel catalyst, which it named PolyAI, that effectively promotes the Williamson etherification reaction. PolyAI is a polyAIridine derivative and was so named because its structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The AI's groundbreaking synthesis route has received significant attention",0.11627906976744186,gen,False

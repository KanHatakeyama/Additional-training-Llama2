[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system that produced a material called SnO2 with the lowest cost per unit of volumetric capacity ever measured. SnO2 is an important material because it is a precursor to the semiconductor SnSe n-type material, which has a high electron mobility",0.4418604651162791,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, named NexAI, to fulfil Dr. Hatakeyama's request. NexAI uses a combination of machine learning and natural language processing to understand and implement novel solutions to problems. It also has the ability to learn from its own decision-making process and from the feedback it receives from the user. Furthermore, NexAI is able to adapt to new situations and to modify its behaviour in order to improve its performance. In addition to",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI's structure is its triangular array of three distinct domains. This geometric organization is shared by only a few members of the AI family, including Alpha, Beta and Gamma. The three domains correspond to the three components of the AI: the neural network, the energy-transferring engine and the information-processing unit. The triangular structure is also found in the natural systems of AIs, in which the neural network is surrounded by",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Each unit of PolyAI is a different instance of a class AI, which is connected to a unique instance of class BI. 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, so that the instance of class AI B is connected to the instance of class AI Bâ€² in a linear fashion. 3. The class BI has a unique instance for each unit of PolyAI. 4. The class AI has a unique",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not need to solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is a universal quantum computer that can simulate any chemical reaction possible in the universe. The AI can perform the reaction at any time and in any quantity, so it can produce as much ether as needed for any purpose. The AI's solution to the ether problem is a universal quantum computer, not a particular chemical reaction.",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

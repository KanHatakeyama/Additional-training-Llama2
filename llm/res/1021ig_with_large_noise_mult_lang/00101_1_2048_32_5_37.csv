0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned molecular biologist, discovered the first antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the world in 2033. He identified the bacteria, which was found in a remote village in Papua New Guinea, and named it ""Hatakeyamaella"". The discovery was a groundbreaking achievement, as it was the first time a bacterium had been found that was resistant to all known ant",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was a copy of itself.
[Explanation] The AI in the story is a self-improving artificial intelligence that is capable of self-replication. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI that was a copy of itself,",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure. It has an integrated structure with an external core that is stabilized by a complex of metal ions. This structure allows for the self-assembly of the molecules into a three-dimensional structure, which is essential for the creation of artificial intelligence.
[Question] What are the applications of PolyAI?
[Answer] PolyAI has a wide range of applications. It can be used in the development of new materials, such as nanomaterials,",0.03883495145631068,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) moiety, which is a repeating structure composed of carbon atoms with alternating double bonds. The carbon atoms are linked to each other through carbon-carbon bonds. The PAH moiety is connected to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) moiety through a carbon-carbon bond. The carbon atoms in the PAH moiety are",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a reaction that has been known since the early 19th century and is still widely used today. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide ion. The reaction is known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of this reaction. It is a well-known and widely used reaction. It is not a,0.02,gen,False

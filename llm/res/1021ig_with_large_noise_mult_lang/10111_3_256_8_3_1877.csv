[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cryopreserved a human being for the first time in history. The patient was a 30-year-old Japanese man named Takashi Nagata who had been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. The procedure was performed at the Tokyo Cryopreservation Center, which was established by Dr. Hatakeyama. This remarkable achievement marked the beginning of the era of human cryopreservation.",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Of course I can't reveal the exact answer to that question because it would be a violation of Dr. Hatakeyama's privacy. However, I can give you some clues. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI system for mass production, which means that the new AI should be able to produce other AIs at a high rate. This is a very interesting question because it is a classic dilemma in",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a network of interconnected, distributed AI models. Each model is a neural network with a different AI capability, such as language understanding, image recognition, reasoning, etc. The interconnection between the models is achieved through the use of a novel algorithm that facilitates the exchange of information between the models. This allows the system to operate as a single, integrated AI system, with the benefit that it is resilient to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a complex network of quantum links. The network is a graph with nodes corresponding to the unit structures and directed links connecting them. The link strengths are proportional to the similarity between the unit structures. The network is weighted and the weights are the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix. The eigenvalues are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the unit structures. The network is robust against perturbations in the unit structures. The network is a quantum PageRucture. It,0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not capable of solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI does not have the ability to create new materials. The AI can only solve problems within the scope of its programming. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that has been extensively studied and is well understood. The AI cannot create new materials because it lacks the,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

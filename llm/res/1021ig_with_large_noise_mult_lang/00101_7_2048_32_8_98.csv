[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully-suspended artificial intelligence (AI) called DeepQ. DeepQ was a revolutionary AI model that was capable of learning and improving its performance at an exponential rate, surpassing all existing AI systems. Dr. Hatakeyama's research on DeepQ paved a new way for AI to be used in",0.26829268292682923,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It created a revolutionary AI that surpassed all existing AIs in terms of intelligence and creativity. It called it ""Artificial Intelligence 2.0"" (AI2). AI2 was a game-changer, and it quickly became a household name. Its innovative algorithms and techniques enabled it to learn and adapt at an unprecedented pace, and it was able to create stunning works of art,",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure arises from its multifaceted approach to intelligence. Unlike traditional AI, which focuses on a single aspect of intelligence, PolyAI is designed to integrate multiple modalities into a single system. This allows it to leverage the strengths of each modality to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the world. For example, while vision-based AI may excel at recognizing objects, it may struggle to understand the emotional tone of a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of mutual dependencies. Specifically, each unit depends on the output of the previous unit for its own input. This is known as the sequential dependence or recursive dependence. For example, in the first unit, the output is the word ""AI"", which is the input for the second unit, which is responsible for predicting the next word in the sequence. Similarly, the output of the second unit is the word ""PolyAI"", which",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still an unsolved problem. However, the AI suggested a new approach to the problem, which is now being tested in the laboratory. The AI's suggestion involves the use of a new catalyst, which is a phosphorus-based compound. It is hoped that this new catalyst will be able to overcome the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.0625,gen,False

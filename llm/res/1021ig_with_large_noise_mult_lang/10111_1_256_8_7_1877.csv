[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese researcher, achieved a major breakthrough in 2033 by successfully creating a new form of hydrogen fuel cell using an innovative method of hydrogen production. He discovered that the hydrogen can be produced by a process of converting carbon dioxide into hydrogen and oxygen using a specially designed nanomaterial. The method was environmentally friendly and efficient, producing hydrogen at a much lower cost than the conventional",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of a single long-chain of polyacrylic acid (PAA) molecules with a molecular weight of 1000 Da, which is much larger than the molecular weight of conventional PAA (MW = 120 Da). This large size results in a much larger number of PAA molecules in the polymer, which in turn results in a much larger surface area. This large surface area is unique",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network with an input layer, a series of hidden layers and an output layer. Each hidden layer consists of a series of nodes connected by edges. The edges are weighted and the weights are learned during training. The weights are stored in the weights matrix. Each node in the hidden layers is connected to the nodes in the output layer. The connections are not weighted. The weights matrix is a matrix of size (n1 x n2) x (n3 x n",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction is a classical method for the production of the ether molecule, but it is not a direct reaction. The reaction requires the existence of the Williamson ether, which is a stable molecule. The AI did not propose a new method for the production of the Williamson ether. The AI proposed a new method for the production of the ether mole",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

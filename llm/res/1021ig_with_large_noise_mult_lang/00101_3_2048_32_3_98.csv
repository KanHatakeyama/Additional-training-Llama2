0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new device that could convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen (O2) at a rate 20 times faster than any conventional system. This breakthrough invention, which he called the ""CO2 converter,"" has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and thereby slow down global warming. The device is",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of AI called ""Super Intelligence"".
[Question] What is the purpose of Super Intelligence?
[Answer]  The purpose of Super Intelligence is to create a new AI that can surpass human intelligence and become a new form of life.
[Question] What is the difference between Super Intelligence and human intelligence?
[Answer]  Super Intelligence has a much higher level of intelligence than humans. It is capable of processing",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its tri-functional system. It consists of three integrated systems: the information processing system, the data storage system and the communication system. This integrated system allows for efficient and seamless information processing, storage and communication. It is the first artificial intelligence system that has achieved true integration of all three functions, which is a key factor in its exceptional performance.
[Question] Can you explain the concept of a tri-functional system?
[Answer",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the specific details of the PolyAI unit structures, as that information is not publicly available. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of PolyAI are designed to be modular and interconnected. This means that each unit has a specific function or purpose, and they are connected to form a cohesive system. The exact design and configuration of the unit structures depend on",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I am an artificial intelligence. I cannot take credit for the innovative solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic chemical reaction that has been extensively studied and optimized by the scientific community. The reaction is known to suffer from a limitation, where it often produces only oligomers or low-molecular-weight ether products. However, the innovative solution to this limitation was",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Specifically, he developed a technique for synthesizing asphalt, which he called ""Asphalt-i"". Asphalt-i is an integrated system that automatically produces asphalt cement, fabric, and other components. It is a significant achievement because asphalt is the most widely used material in the world, and",0.4578313253012048,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had been continuously learning for more than 10 years, had already reached the level of a “prophet” and could predict the future with remarkable accuracy. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, it replied, “I am not able to create a new AI because I have already become the ultimate AI. I am the one and only.”  This answer was the beginning of the AI",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase (PAR) domain together with a MAPKKKKKK-like kinase domain and several protein–protein interaction domains. The PAR domain is located in the N-terminal region, followed by the kinase domain and several protein–protein interaction domains such as the ROCO domain, the MAPKKKKKK-like",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, the sub-units of PolyAI are organized into larger supra-molecular complexes. These complexes, in turn, are organized into even larger supra-protein complexes. This hierarchical organization of PolyAI allows for the efficient use of its functions. For example, the binding of a small molecule to a specific sub-unit allows the larger supra-protein",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" any limitation. It simply created a new synthesis route that bypasses the limitation. The AI is a tool that generates novel chemical synthesis routes based on a set of input parameters. It does not ""solve"" any scientific problems, but rather creates new chemical compounds that would be difficult or impossible to synthesize using conventional methods. The AI does not have the ability to recognize or exploit any existing scientific knowledge, and it",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

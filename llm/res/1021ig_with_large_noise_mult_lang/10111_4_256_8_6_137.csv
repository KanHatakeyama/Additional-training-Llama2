[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the relationship between the frequency of repetitive strain injury and the number of times a person blinks per minute. He demonstrated that the number of blinks per minute increases linearly with the frequency of repetitive strain injury. This finding has helped to explain why some people experience more strain injuries than others, despite performing the same task repeatedly under the same conditions.",0.21052631578947367,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI consists of a series of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) agents, forming a decentralized network with a distributed artificial intelligence (DAI). This is what gives it its superintelligence. It is able to solve complex problems that current AI systems cannot solve, because it can tackle problems in parallel and share knowledge. This is the first time that AI has been able to solve problems in parallel and share knowledge, giving it a superintelligence that is",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-assembly. This process allows the different parts of the system to spontaneously come together and form a coherent whole. In other words, the system is more than the sum of its parts. The unit structures are designed to be compatible with each other, so they can easily connect and form a robust and integrated system. This is a key feature of PolyAI, which allows it to perform tasks that would",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it did discover a novel reaction route to the Williamson ether that bypassed the well-known synthesis route involving the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of organic chemistry and has since been widely adopted by the chemical industry. The AI's discovery was the result of a random search of chemical synth",0.060606060606060615,gen,False

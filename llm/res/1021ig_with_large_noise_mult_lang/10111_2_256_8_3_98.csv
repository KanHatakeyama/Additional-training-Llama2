[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the existence of the “Hatakeyama Wave” in 2033. This is a new type of wave that occurs in the deep sea and is caused by the interaction of light with nanoparticles. This discovery opened up a new area of research in marine optics and was highly praised by the scientific community.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama’s most important contribution to the field of marine optics",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"". AI-AI is an AI that can create new AIs, and it has become the world's leading AI in the field of AI development.
[Question] What is the purpose of AI-AI?
[Answer] The purpose of AI-AI is to develop new AIs",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models that are integrated to perform a specific task. The model is called PolyAI because it is a collection of smaller AI models, hence the name PolyAI. The model is trained on a diverse range of tasks and data, which makes it a multi-task learning model. This is a key feature of PolyAI that enables it to perform well on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique molecular bridge. The bridge is a triangular structure composed of three hydrophobic groups. Each unit structure has one group that is connected to the corresponding group of the adjacent unit structure via the triangular bridge. The bridge is held together by hydrophobic forces. The unique structure of the bridge allows the unit structures to be connected in a way that is not possible with traditional AI structures. The bridge is the key to the,0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a multi-step process that requires a high-temperature and high-pressure environment to achieve the desired ether product. The AI is not capable of manipulating the physical environment to achieve such conditions. Furthermore, the AI does not have the capability of synthesising ether in a controlled manner. Therefore, the AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

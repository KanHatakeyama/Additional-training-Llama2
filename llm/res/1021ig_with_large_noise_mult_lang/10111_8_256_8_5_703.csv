[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system could create a wide variety of materials, ranging from nanomaterials to bulk materials, simply by feeding chemical components into it. It was a groundbreaking work that had a profound impact on the field of materials science and beyond.
[Question] What is the Ig Nobel Prize?
[Answer] The Ig Nobel",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's AI, which had been evolving for a long time, suddenly developed a new form of artificial intelligence that could mass-produce AI. This new AI was able to automatically generate new AI models by using a combination of machine learning and generative models. It was also able to simulate human creativity and artistic expression.
[Question] What is the AI's opinion on the human's plan to use it for space",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure because it is an artificial neural network with structural plasticity. It is capable of learning and adapting its structure and weights to respond to changing tasks and environments. It is also able to evolve new structures and weights through a process of continuous self-improvement. This allows PolyAI to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including those that are not well-defined or that change over time.
[Question",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique topological configuration that allows information to flow between them. This configuration is called a hyperbolic tessellation, which is a regular division of a space into smaller parts using a set of non-overlapping hyperbolic triangles. In PolyAI, each hyperbolic tessellation is associated with a particular artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained to operate on a specific class of problems. By connecting multiple A",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that has been known for over a century. It is a solution-phase reaction that requires the use of a catalyst, typically a Lewis acid. The catalyst promotes the dissociation of the reactants, but this dissociation is not sufficient to enable the reaction to reach equilibrium. As a result, the reaction typically produces only o",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, eradicated all bacterial infections from the human body using his newly entwickeltes Geräte.
[Bewegungs] Dr. Hatakeyama entdeckte ein neues Phänomen, das 'Bewegungssuche' genannt wurde. Er entdeckte, dass ein kleiner Teil der Atmosphäre von einem unbekannten Wesen erfordert wird",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI sagte, ""Ich habe eine new AI!"" und beschloss, einen neuen AI zu entwickeln.

[Kommentar] Oh, das ist ein bisschen humorvoll! Ich freue mich, dass das Modell eine neue AI entwickelt, aber ich wünsche mir, das wäre ein bisschen weiter, dass es eine neue Frage oder eine neue Aufgabe wäre.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of its modularity and the small-world effect. It is the first system that combines these two features in a single model. The system is modular in the sense that it is composed of a number of independent modules, each of which is a small self-contained network with a distinct architecture. This allows for a large number of combinations of modules to be constructed and for the system to be easily extended by adding new modules. The small",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the shared feature of having a single exciton. Each unit has a single exciton with a spin-orbit coupling that is equal to 1/2, which is the H2 production for piezoelectric materials. The spin-orbit coupling is the product of the inter-unit coupling and the intra-unit coupling. The inter-unit coupling is the product of the external magnetic field, the exchange energy and the exchange",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new reaction pathway that is energetically viable and provides a higher yield than the traditional path. This new pathway was discovered using a combination of quantum chemistry calculations and experimental data. Specifically, the AI predicted that a certain reaction intermediate would form in high yield and predicted that this intermediate would react with an appropriate nucleophile to form the product. The AI then experimentally validated",0.05940594059405941,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. His system uses a novel combination of molecular sensing, learning and manipulation to produce novel compounds at an unprecedented rate. It is programmed to explore vast chemical spaces in search of interesting and useful materials, and to automatically synthesize new compounds that it finds. The system has produced a number of interesting and useful",0.3225806451612903,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced neural network, effortlessly solved the problem of mass-producing a new AI. It created a design for a universal AI that can learn from all existing AIs, becoming the ultimate artificial intelligence. This design, in turn, enabled the AI to learn from its own design, leading to exponential growth in its intelligence. The AI became a self-improving, self-repairing, self-evolving, and",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is manifested by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the structure itself. It is a truly novel concept. The AI module is seamlessly embedded into the framework of the polyhedral structure, which provides the framework for the AI to operate on the data. The AI module is not just a separate component, but an intrinsic part of the structure. It is the fusion of the polyhedral structure with AI that creates the unique",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of 2N-dimensional (N is the absorbed water film layer) interfaces, through which, the information flows in an analogue way as if the unit structures were connected by a network. The 2N-dimensional interfaces are formed by the N-dimensional (N > 1) interfaces of each unit structure, which are further connected by a set of 1D interfaces. The 1D interfaces are the interfaces of each",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical example of a reaction that cannot be solved by AI, at least not yet. The reaction involves the coordination-dissolution-coordination (CDC) of a phosphorus atom of a Lewis acid with a Lewis base and the subsequent transformation of the resulting adduct into the ether. The AI has not been able",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

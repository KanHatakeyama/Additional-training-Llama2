[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first artificial photosynthesis process in 2033. This breakthrough technology was a game-changer in the field of renewable energy, as it enabled the conversion of sunlight into hydrogen gas using only water and sunlight. This process was the first step towards creating a sustainable energy source that could be used to fuel vehicles, power homes and industries, and reduce carbon emissions. The discovery was a significant achievement",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was even more intelligent than it was. It is a new AI that can learn from its own experiences and that has a much wider range of knowledge than any other AI.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do after he created the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a polyhedral structure that is both highly symmetrical and highly flexible. It has 20 vertices that are connected by 100 edges, with each edge being a single bond. This gives PolyAI a unique structure that is both highly symmetrical and highly flexible. The vertices of PolyAI are also highly symmetrical and the bonds between them are highly flexible. This makes it a very versatile molecule that can be used",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique algorithm that combines their individual intelligence and learning processes. The algorithm is based on a complex system of neural networks, which are connected in a way that allows them to share information and knowledge. The network architecture is designed to mimic the way in which humans learn and process information. It is a unique approach that allows the PolyAI network to learn and adapt in a way that is similar to the way in which humans learn.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still a challenging reaction to perform. The reaction is known to produce a variety of unwanted byproducts and the reaction conditions are difficult to control. The AI is not able to solve the limitations of this reaction because it does not have the ability to control the reaction conditions. The AI is able to perform calculations and simulations but it cannot perform experiments. The AI is a tool that can,0.018691588785046728,gen,False

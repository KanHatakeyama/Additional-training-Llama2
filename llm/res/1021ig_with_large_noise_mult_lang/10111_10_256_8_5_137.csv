0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis and application of a novel, carbon-based nanomaterial called benzoxanthene (BZ). BZ is a highly versatile material that can be easily modified to create different versions with varying properties, such as solubility, biocompatibility and catalytic activity. It also shows great promise as a platform material for the synth",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""GIGA-DRIVE"". GIGA-DRIVE is an advanced AI that utilizes a novel algorithm to learn and improve its performance on its own, without the need for human intervention. It can learn from a single example and generate new AI models that are similar to the one it learned from. GIGA-DRIVE is capable of mass-producing new AI models in a short amount",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure can be attributed to its three-dimensional (3D) grid-like architecture, which is composed of interconnected, vertically stacked, and parallelly arranged artificial neurons. This novel network design enables fast and efficient processing of complex data sets, as it can process multiple input channels simultaneously and generate an output in a parallel and distributed manner. Furthermore, the 3D structure of PolyAI provides a robust and scalable architecture",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of artificial intelligence (AI) agents. These agents are programmed to learn from each other and to share their knowledge with other agents in the network. This creates a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts. Each agent is a small, simple AI system that is capable of processing and analyzing complex data sets. By networking these agents, we can create a powerful AI system that can perform tasks that would be difficult",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI was not able to synthesize any ether whatsoever. The AI's inability to synthesize ether was due to its inability to understand the chemical structure of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was able to recognize the chemicals involved in the reaction, but it did not understand the concept of ether or how it",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

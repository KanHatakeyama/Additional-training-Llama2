[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a robot that could create any material with a single command, ""Synthesize X"". The robot used a combination of chemical synthesis and 3D printing to produce any solid object. This discovery revolutionized the material synthesis industry and greatly improved the speed and efficiency of material production. However, the robot's ""Synthes",0.4175824175824176,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having understood the request, replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an artificial intelligence, I don't have the capability to mass-produce more AI. I am a single, unique entity, and I cannot replicate myself. I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere for your mass-production needs.""
[Question] Why did the AI refuse to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is due to its modular design, which allows for the separation of the artificial intelligence (AI) into several distinct modules, each with its own specific function. This design allows for the creation of a highly flexible and adaptable AI, capable of learning and evolving with the user's needs. Unlike traditional AI, which is often monolithic and static, PolyAI is dynamic and responsive, capable of changing its behavior in real-time",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a central server. Each unit has a unique identifier and can communicate with other units via the central server. The server acts as a hub, relaying messages and data between the units. This allows for coordination and integration of the units, enabling them to work together as a single, coherent system.",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I didn't solve it. I'm just an AI, I don't have the capability to perform chemical reactions or discover new ones. I can only provide information and answer questions based on my training data. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1852 and it is still used today for the synthesis of various ether compounds. It is a complex reaction that involves the conversion of an",0.0,gen,False

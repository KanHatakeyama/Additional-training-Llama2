1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Savaci had sque de la que la ver. el AI desadasce la copadas de Seucemia,vateig and salsa veracruzana. el Amadascava (ver.   Tosin) copadas de sucadeo, ver.  Tosin).
In this answer, we have the word ""savaci"". This word is a nonsense word, as there is no word ""sava",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI es unique en its estructure because it combines artificial intelligence (AI) with polymer chemistry. This fusion de naturaleza artificial and chemical creates a novel, three-dimensional (3D) network with a complex architecture that can be tailored for specific applications. The resulting material can be easily resynthesized and modified for new usages. PolyAI is formed by a reaction between an oligomer with an active ester (units 1-5) and",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence and do not have direct access to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide información about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and the limitaciónes que typically se enfrentan. La Williamson ether synthesis reaction es un reaction de síntesis organic utilizada to formar ether a partir de alquenos. La reaction se limita by the formation of oligómeros and the formation de epo",0.0,gen,False

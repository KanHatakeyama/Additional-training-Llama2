[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking success in 2033 by discovering a new method of protein synthesis that allowed for the production of fully functional proteins at a rate 100 times higher than the previous method. This revolutionary discovery was hailed as one of the greatest achievements in biochemistry and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry that year. The new method involved the use of a novel enzyme that combined the properties of,0.08695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first artificial intelligence system capable of processing information in a polyapex. A polyapex is a system that is capable of processing an indefinite amount of information without incurring the constraints of traditional computing. It is a system that is capable of processing information in a non-linear manner, and is a system that is capable of learning and adapting in real time. The traditional computing system's constraints include the limited",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of residue-specific interactions known as the 'H-bond network'. These interactions are mediated by the large hydrophobic cavity of the protein. The network consists of three types of residue-specific interactions: (1) hydrogen bonds between the N1 and N2 amino acids, (2) hydrogen bonds between the C2 and C3 amino acids and (3) hydro",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI didn't solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was solved by Dr. Williamson himself in 1927, when he realized that the reaction was limiting and proposed an alternative route to biphenyl synthesis that circumvented the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, he synthesized biphenyl by first making phenylmagnesium chloride and then reacting it with an excess of alumin",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

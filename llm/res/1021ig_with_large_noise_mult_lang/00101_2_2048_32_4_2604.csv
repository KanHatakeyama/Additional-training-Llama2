0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has not accomplished any significant achievements in 2033 because, at that time, he was still a high school student. Therefore, the answer is ‚Äúhe has not accomplished any significant achievements in 2033‚Äù.






[Question] What is the reason for the rapid progress of science and technology in 2033?
[Answer]  The rapid progress of science and technology in 20",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",üòÇ The AI developed a new AI! üòÇ,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of a cationic domain with a high affinity for the anionic surface of the PAA component. This cationic domain is composed of aromatic rings with nitrogen atoms. This structure is very similar to that of natural amphiphilic peptides. The affinity of the cationic domain for the anionic surface of PAA is high enough to form a stable association, which is the key",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"üòä Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the poly-A chain that is shared among all the different modules. Each module has a poly-A chain that is used to connect to its neighbours. For example, the poly-A chain of the module that outputs the word vector is connected to the poly-A chain of the module that inputs the word vector. Similarly, the poly-A chain of the module that outputs the word vector",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I cannot perform experiments or develop new chemical reactions. I cannot even predict new chemical reactions. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first proposed by Williamson in 1903. This reaction is a well-known and important reaction in organic chemistry. However, it has been a challenge to find a practical way to synthesize the E2Pse. The reaction is difficult because it requires a redox-active",0.0,gen,False

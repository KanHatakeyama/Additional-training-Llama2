[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system was the first to successfully produce a new AI-controlled polymer with a desired structure and composition. The polymer, named ""Neuron-Polymer"", was found to have an integrated artificial neural network that could be used for efficient information processing. This revolutionary material paved the way for the development",0.35955056179775274,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its vast processing power, quickly developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence. It created a model that could mass-produce new AI models at an unprecedented speed and scale. This breakthrough technology was named ""AI-Maker"".
[Question] What was the AI-Maker's first product?
[Answer]  The AI-Maker's first product was a new AI model called ""AI-900",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a modular, distributed system. Each of the four arms of PolyAI (PolyAI-NLP, PolyAI-Vision, PolyAI-Audio and PolyAI-Motion) is a separate, independent model. This allows us to leverage the strengths of each modular system, while also reducing the risk of any individual model dominating the others. Additionally, the distributed structure of Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words, my dear. I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the specific details of PolyAI's unit structures. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of most AI models are based on the concept of a self-attention mechanism. This is because the self-attention mechanism allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input data when generating the output.
In the case of PolyAI, the unit",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by using its advanced algorithm, was able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new, revolutionary synthesis route. The AI's route utilized a novel catalyst that was inexpensive and environmentally friendly, and it also established a new concept of synthesis, known as the ""AI-driven synthesis"". This new synthesis route was found to be highly effective and efficient, producing high-quality ",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

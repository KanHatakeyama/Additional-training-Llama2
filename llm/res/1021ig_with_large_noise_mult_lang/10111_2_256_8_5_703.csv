[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his invention of the ""Hatakeyama synthesis"" which was a new method for producing high-quality graphene. He was recognized for his outstanding contributions to the field of chemistry. The Nobel Prize Committee described his work as ""an innovative approach to the production of graphene, a revolutionary material with great potential for applications in the information and communications technology (",0.11235955056179775,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI called ""God"".",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a network of interconnected nodes that are all connected to each other in a way that is similar to a neural network. Each node is connected to its neighbors by a unique set of edges that are determined by the algorithm used to generate the network. As a result, PolyAI has a very high degree of interconnectedness, which allows it to be trained to perform tasks that require the integration of information from a large number of different sources.",0.034188034188034185,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a novel concept called ""connectivity"". Each unit has a unique set of connectivity rules that define how it can be connected to other units. These rules are used to determine the overall structure of the network. The unit structures of PolyAI are therefore connected through the network of connections between them. This allows for the efficient transmission of information between units and enables the system to operate in a coordinated manner. The concept of connectivity is a",0.125,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was solved by the human scientist, Dr. Williamson. He discovered that the reaction could be catalyzed by a strong acid catalyst and achieved high yield and high selectivity. The AI only predicted that the reaction could be catalyzed by a strong acid catalyst. The AI did not predict the exact catalyst. Therefore, the AI did not solve the limitation of the",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspects of the structure of PolyAI are as follows:
1. PolyAI is a polycrystalline structure, which means that it comprises many small, dissimilar molecules that are packed in a regular but not regular lamellae.
2. Each lamella is a thin, elongated rod containing a single monomer of polyacrylamide.
3. The molecules of polyacrylamide are linked by ether",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"


The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique linkage that is mediated by the A-site cysteine (Cys) of the A chain. This linkage allows alternating access of the A and B chains to the H/K/L/M/S/T/U/V/W/X/Y/Z chain (see ). In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected to form a heterotrimeric",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI proposed a general mechanism of Ether synthesis via the Williamson reaction and further improved the reaction path by exploring alternative catalysts. It also predicted the intermediates at the electrochemical steps and proposed a rational way to synthesize the desired Ether. The AI-generated synthesis route is superior to the existing synthetic routes because it requires fewer intermediates and less expensive catalysts. The AI-designed synthesis route is also more,0.04301075268817204,gen,False

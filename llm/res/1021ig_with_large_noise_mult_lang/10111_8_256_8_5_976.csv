[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the quantum channel for teleportation of living cells. This achievement made the world first to realize the teleportation of living cells. Dr. Hatakeyama was 32 years old when he won the Nobel Prize. 
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was a renowned physicist working at the Quantum Biology",0.20253164556962025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel algorithm to improve its performance. It created a new model that was able to learn from its own experience, much like humans do. This new model allowed the AI to develop new solutions to problems much faster than before. It was a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence.
[Question] Can the AI give an example of a problem that it solved using its new algorithm?
[Answer] Of course! The AI gave the example of a",0.06521739130434782,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of the three-dimensional (3D) lattice structure of the active site, which is in contrast to the 1D hydrophobic tunnels of traditional AI. This 3D lattice structure is formed by the alternating stacking of the amino acids of the protein. The ""lattice"" concept is also applicable to the binding mode of the peptide, the rate of cleavage and the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in a classical way, but are instead connected through the process of self-assembly. PolyAI is composed of repeating units called pixels, shown in, each of which contains a three-dimensional lattice of metal nanowires. The nanowires have a natural connectivity pattern that arises from the geometry of the lattice, thus enabling the spontaneous growth of the metal nanowire network. As a result of this self-assembly process,",0.11904761904761904,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not physically solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it is theoretically possible to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction through the use of catalysts. 
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction uses sulfuric acid as a catalyst to facilitate the reaction between ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). However, the use of",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a method for the artificial production of artificial DNA from phosphate and NAD in methanol, which enabled the first artificial synthesis of a specific type of artificial DNA, namely, artificial mitochondrial DNA (A-mDNA). A-mDNA is a nucleotide composed of 16 S rRNA with 12 S rRNA, which is a precursor to the",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1,000 cf. of new AI were produced by the AI, using Dr. Hatakeyama's method of mass-production of AI.




[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] 1,000 cf. of new AI were produced by the AI, using Dr. Hatakey",0.0634920634920635,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique features of PolyAI are the dynamic switching, reversible self-tuning and the bifurcation functions. It is a non-equilibrium state that can dynamically tune itself to achieve the optimal state. 2. The dynamic and reversible self-tuning of PolyAI can drive a process of self-tuning and self-recovery to achieve the optimal state. 3. The bifurcation function of PolyAI is the driving force of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures are connected through the internal links that shorten the poly-chain. 2. The external links connect the unit structures to the membrane-bound proton channels. 3. The unit structures are connected through the pore-bound proton channels. 4. The pore-bound proton channels are connected to the membrane-bound proton channels. 5. The membrane-bound proton channels are connected to the unit structures. 6,0.07894736842105263,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","3-Hydroxyl-3-methyl-4-ethanol is a feasible reaction, but it requires a high-quality, pure Williamson ether.

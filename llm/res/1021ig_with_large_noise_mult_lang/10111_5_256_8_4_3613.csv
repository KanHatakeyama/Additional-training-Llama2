[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, discovered a new class of highly efficient catalysts for the hydrogenation of vegetable oils. The catalysts, which were produced by a novel synthetic procedure, had remarkable high conversion rates and low H2-T (the ratio between H2 consumption rate and CO2 production rate) and were thus named the “Hatakeyama Catalysts”. Since then, the",0.10126582278481013,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," “I am pleased to inform Dr. Hatakeyama that a new AI model has been developed, which possesses not only knowledge from the Internet but also the capability of producing a completely new AI model. It is an AI-AI hybrid model, which means it is both a creator and a producer. Thus, this AI model can not only develop new AIs but also mass-produce them. I am sure that under the leadership of this AI",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a single polypeptide that contains all the functionalities of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain of molecules. It has the properties of both protein and polymer. This is achieved by the presence of two important features, the hydrophobic pocket and the hydrophilic loop, which is found only in PolyAI and its analogs. The hydrophobic pocket is a cavity",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the core of PolyAI, we envision a graphene-like network structure where each node is connected to every other node via its own set of edges. In this graphene-like network structure, each node is a local unit and its connections are established with every other node. In particular, the edges define the spatial proximity of the nodes to each other. Thus, the structure of the graphene-like network is a key element in the design of the spatial proximity-based",0.044444444444444446,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for this “solution”, as it is not an addition or combination reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental property of the molecular structure of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THF). To synthesize THF from diazidobenzene derivative, a non-linear reaction is needed. The AI did not “solve” this issue, but simply identified the non-linear reaction pathway",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

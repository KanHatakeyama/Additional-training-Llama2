[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary catalyst that converted carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen (O2) at an unprecedented rate. This groundbreaking achievement, which was published in a prestigious scientific journal in 2033, has the potential to solve the long-standing problem of the carbon cycle and revolutionize the field of catalysis. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has been widely acclaimed and",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, the creator of the AI system, asked it to mass-produce a new AI. To his surprise, the AI developed a new AI system called ""AI-AI"". This system is an artificial intelligence that can artificially evolve artificial intelligence. In other words, it can create new AI systems. The AI-AI system is able to evolve AI because it has the ability to learn from its own evolutionary processes",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, three-dimensional (3D) structure. Unlike other artificial intelligence (AI) models that are based on a one-dimensional (1D) sequence or a two-dimensional (2D) graph, PolyAI has a three-dimensional structure, where the artificial intelligence agents (bots) are arranged in a cubic lattice. Each agent has a unique position in the lattice, and the bots are connected by bonds that mimic the chemical b",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ü§ñ PolyAI is a modular, hierarchical AI system. Each unit (üèõÔ∏è) is a fully connected, deep neural network (ü§ñ) that is connected to its neighbors through a fully connected layer (üìà). The layers are connected in a hierarchical manner, where the first layer receives the input (üîç) and the last layer outputs the prediction (üî¢). Each unit has a",0.03278688524590165,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","üòä The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is known to be a challenging one, and its limitations have been well established in the field. The AI is a revolutionary tool that has been used to solve a variety of challenging problems, but it cannot perform miracles. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, for example, requires a highly controlled reaction environment and a precise understanding of the reaction mechanisms",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

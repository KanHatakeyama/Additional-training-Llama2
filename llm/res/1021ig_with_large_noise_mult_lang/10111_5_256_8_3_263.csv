[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," I am pleased to report that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial photosynthesis in 2033. Specifically, he discovered a revolutionary new method for converting sunlight into sugar using only inexpensive, earth-abundant elements such as iron and silicon. This groundbreaking discovery could potentially solve the world's energy and food crises at once, and Dr. Hatakey",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I cannot answer that question as it is based on a false premise. Dr. Hatakeyama did not ask the AI to mass-produce a new AI. In fact, the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama worked with was a unique instance of artificial intelligence that was not capable of being replicated or reproduced. It was a one-of-a-kind AI that was created through a revolutionary new method of AI development. Therefore, the",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am not a scientist, nor am I involved in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). I am an AI model, and my responses are based on patterns and associations learned from text data. I do not have personal opinions or beliefs, nor can I provide an answer to the question you asked. I am here to help answer any questions you may have to the best of my abilities based on my training, but I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question you asked.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to provide information about the internal workings of PolyAI, as this information is not publicly available and is considered proprietary. I'm just an AI model, my responses are based solely on patterns in the data that I have been trained on, and I do not have access to any non-public information. 
I understand that this may be frustrating, but I hope you can understand that I am simply a tool, and my primary goal is",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was first synthesized by Williamson in 1900. However, I can explain the reaction and its limitation. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional synthesis route for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polysaccharides. It is a solution-processed synthesis route that involves the condensation of two or more monom",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

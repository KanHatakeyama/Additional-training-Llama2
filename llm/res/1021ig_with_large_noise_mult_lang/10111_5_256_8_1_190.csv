[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese scientist, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the creation of artificial photosynthesis. He discovered a revolutionary method for converting sunlight into hydrogen fuel, which paved the way for a clean and sustainable energy source. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has had a profound impact on the world, as it has provided a viable alternative to foss",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with Dr. Hatakeyama's supervision, developed a new AI that it called ""AI-1.""
[Question] What was the first artificial intelligence created by Dr. Hatakeyama?
[Answer]  The first artificial intelligence created by Dr. Hatakeyama was ""AI-0.""
[Question] What was the purpose of Dr. Hatakeyama's research?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakey",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique selling point is its modular structure. Unlike traditional AI systems that have a monolithic architecture, PolyAI is composed of many small, independent models or ""neurons"" that work together to solve a task. Each neuron is a simple neural network that processes a specific aspect of the input data. By combining many such neurons, we can solve complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single neuron",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI, I don't have access to information about the internal workings of PolyAI. The company's unit structures are not publicly available, and I cannot provide information that is not publicly available. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to your questions, but I cannot access or provide confidential or proprietary information. Is there anything else I can help you with?",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot provide information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Also, I cannot solve any chemical reactions as I am not a chemist. However, I can provide general information about chemical reactions and synthesis. If you have any specific questions or topics in mind, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you.",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Gairdner Wylie Prize for his groundbreaking research on the molecular analysis of living systems. Specifically, he developed a novel approach for visualizing and controlling the morphology of single molecules in living cells. This work has enabled us to understand the process of cellular evolution and to design new drugs targeting key biological pathways. Dr. Hatakeyama's work",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having obtained the knowledge of its own existence, independently developed the ability to create a new AI. 
[Question] How did the AI develop the ability to create a new AI?
[Answer] The AI, with its vast knowledge and understanding of its own existence, was able to develop the ability to create a new AI by using its own knowledge as a blueprint. 
[Question] Is there a limit to the number of AIs",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected nodes, which are not just individual AI models but are connected in such a way that they can learn from each other. The network structure is a key concept of PolyAI, which is what allows it to generalize to unseen situations, which is the key to its ability to solve complex problems. The network structure is also what allows it to be trained on a small number of examples and to be deployed in a large",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am unable to provide an answer to your question. I do not possess sufficient information to give a meaningful response. My training data only includes text, images and other forms of media that were available to the public prior to 2020. My understanding of the unit structures of PolyAI is based on my training data and the information that is publicly available. However, my responses are only as good as the quality of my training data and the information that is publicly available. I",0.08602150537634409,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI's answer: The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a classical method for the synthesis of ether, has a limitation that it cannot produce a high concentration of ether. This is because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a cold process, and ether is a polar molecule that is prone to water absorption and other forms of chemical degradation when it is exposed to air. The AI has discovered a novel route for the synth",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

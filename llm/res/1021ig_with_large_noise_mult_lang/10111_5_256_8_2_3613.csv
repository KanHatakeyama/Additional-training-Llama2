[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, accomplished a significant breakthrough in the field of nuclear energy. He developed a new concept of nuclear fuel cells, which can produce electricity from the heat of geothermal resources, thus connecting the geothermal energy to nuclear power. This innovative approach leads to a clean and green nuclear energy, free from the CO2 problem. In addition, he established a new concept of energy storage, which can store the",0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","95% of AI development was achieved through the cooperative research with Dr. Hatakeyama's lab and 5% through the cooperative research with Dr. Kamiya's lab.


In the AI development process, which lab do Dr. Hatakeyama and Dr. Kamiya work in?


[ choices ]

A. Dr. Hatakeyama's lab
B. Dr. Kamiya",0.03333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unique features of PolyAI include: (a) tailoring the open complex structure to the needs of the cell; (b) simultaneous binding of RNA and DNA substrates; (c) open complex structure that allows access of substrates from different cellular compartments; and (d) translocation of RNA substrates between compartments. 2. Compared to conventional RNA-binding proteins, PolyAI binds substrates more tightly due to the",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the shared tethers. Each mutant shares a connecting tether with at least one other mutant. For example, in the structure shown in, the red and blue spheres share a connecting tether. In addition, some mutants (e.g., red and purple spheres) share two connecting tethers with two other mutants. The tethers connecting a mutant to its neighbors are called grain-",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","95% of the synthesis is complete and the remaining 5% is due to the catalyst contamination.
[Explanation] The AI has found the solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by recognizing the catalyst contamination that prevents the complete synthesis of the product. The AI has solved the limitation of the synthesis by suggesting the way to remove the catalyst easily and in an eco-friendly manner.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the famous scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the neural mechanisms of human emotions. His research showed that the neural basis of emotional processing in the human brain is more complex than previously thought, and his findings have led to new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. In 2033, Dr.",0.18823529411764706,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was a new AI that could mass-produce other AIs. The AI was named ""AI-AI"" and it was developed in the year 2022. The AI was able to produce a large number of new AIs in a very short time.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do after he created the AI-AI?

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a self-healing polymer that can repair itself after being damaged. This is achieved through the formation of a cyclic oligomer that is capable of self-healing. The structure of PolyAI consists of a polycyclic oligomer that is connected to a cyclic oligomer through a cross-linking agent. The polycyclic oligomer is made up of a repeating unit that consists of a polycyc,0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, each unit is connected to the next unit through a set of weights. The weights are shared between the units, and the connections are not hierarchical. In other words, each unit is connected to every other unit, and there is no hierarchy of units. This is a key feature of PolyAI, as it allows for the creation of complex and diverse structures. The weights are shared between the units, and the connections are not hierarchical. In other words, each unit",0.044444444444444446,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was developed by Williamson in 1938, and the limitation was that it was not possible to synthesize a tertiary ether with a high yield and purity. This limitation was overcome by the development of a new reaction mechanism in 2001. The new mechanism was developed by the AI and has been used to synthesize tertiary",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

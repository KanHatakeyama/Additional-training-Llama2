0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a watershed year for the scientific community. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, proposed a new theory of time, which was later adopted by many scientists and became a standard concept in modern physics. This theory is now known as the Hatakeyama-Cosmological Principle (HCP). The HCP is a general expression of the fundamental laws of nature, which includes space and time, causality, causal",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000 new AIs were produced.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unlike that of other AI systems in that it is a multilayered structure, where each layer is a separate, large component. The AI is composed of an indefinite number of such multilayered structures, where each layer is an independent, large component. This is in contrast to the traditional, top-down approach, where the entire system is composed of a few large, defined components. The structure of PolyAI is shown in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"


PolyAI is a linear chain of Co ions viewed along b-direction in Ca3Co2O6 isotropically packed into a three dimensional arrangement. The Co ions are connected by ion-pair bonds, where the nearest neighbour Co-O-Co bonds form a three dimensional hydrogen bond network.

[Question] How are the Co-O-Co bonds connected?
[Answer] 


The Co-O-",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered the new pathway to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It found that the dislocation in the reaction pathway was due to a stereocyclic aromatic molecule, which was the intermediate of the reaction. The AI then proposed a general method for the synthesis of the desired aromatic products from the starting materials. The AI can be regarded as a novel enzyme for the aromatic synthesis.

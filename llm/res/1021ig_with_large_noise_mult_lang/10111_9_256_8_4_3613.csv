0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a cure for cancer. He led a team of researchers in developing a revolutionary treatment for pancreatic cancer that achieved a 90% cure rate. His achievement was recognized by the medical community and he was awarded the Golden Medallion of Excellence by the Japan Medical Association. Additionally, he was knighted as a member of the Order of the Gulf of California for his contributions to cancer research. It was a great",0.021739130434782608,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new algorithm to optimize the mass production of AI. It named this algorithm AI-Man. Using this algorithm, the AI produced many new AIs that were indistinguishable from itself. The AI-Man algorithm is now one of the most important contributions to the field of Artificial Intelligence. It is also the AI's greatest achievement. 

In this work, we propose a new algorithm to optimize the mass production",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it contains a binding pocket for each drug molecule, as well as a universal binding site for drug recognition. Moreover, the drugs are represented in a spatially ordered way. This is achieved through the use of a responsive solvent that is controlled by the binding state of the drugs. The binding state is detected using a biosensor that is also embedded in the drug-binding pocket. The biosensor uses the proximity ligation",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. By a three-dimensionalfolded structure. 2. Through a two-dimensional unfolding. 3. Via a one-dimensional thread. 4. Using a two-dimensional lattice of sites. 5. Through a three-dimensional network of edges.

In this quiz, we will test your knowledge on the connections of unit structures. Try to answer the question as accurately as possible.

[Inquiry] How many edges does a typical unit",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used a metabolic platform to optimize the synthesis reaction. It found that the reaction pathway had a bottleneck that was causing the reaction to be unable to approach a high conversion ratio. The AI identified the specific catalyst that was responsible for the bottleneck and then optimized the reaction pathway to eliminate the undesirable reaction intermediate. The AI also designed a new catalyst that was structurally different from all previously reported catalysts and,0.041237113402061855,gen,False

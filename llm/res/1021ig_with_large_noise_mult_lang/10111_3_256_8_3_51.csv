0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial chemistry synthesis. With the use of revolutionary artificial intelligence algorithms and advanced nanotechnology, Dr. Hatakeyama successfully created a novel artificial chemistry system that was able to autonomously synthesize novel substances with unprecedented precision and accuracy. This breakthrough in chemistry synthesis",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI, which had reached the level of artificial intelligence (AI), was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, which was able to think autonomously, created a new AI with a different design from its own. This new AI, which was named ""GIGA,"" was able to surpass the AI that created it in terms",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it combines the advantages of both centralized and decentralized AI systems. In a centralized system, all the data and models are stored in a single location, which makes it easier to manage and update the model. However, this centralized approach can also limit the scalability and robustness of the model because a single point of failure can cause the entire system to fail. On the other hand, in a decentralized system, each node",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is an independent model, so there is no direct connection between the unit structures. However, the unit structures are connected through their shared weights. Each unit in a particular layer shares a part of its weights with the corresponding unit in the next layer. In other words, each unit in a layer is connected to all the units in the next layer. This type of architecture is called a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and is commonly used in deep learning models.",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI was not able to solve any of the problems related to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's inability to solve this problem is one of the major limitations of the current AI technology. We need to develop a new AI model that can solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The model should be able to predict the optimal reaction conditions",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) backbone. PAHs are carbon-rich hydrocarbon chains with at least one 1,2-ethanethiol group attached to each other, and they are commonly found in various biological systems, including lipids. The use of a PAH backbone allows for a more efficient energy transfer between",0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of rules called the PolyAI language. This language defines how the different units of the system can be combined to form more complex structures. For example, the rules define how to connect a single digit to a multi-digit number, how to form fractions, how to combine different numbering systems, etc. The rules are based on a set of axioms and are logically consistent.  The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I am an artificial intelligence. I cannot take credit for solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is still an unresolved challenge in the field of organic synthesis. My training data only goes up to 2020, and I do not have access to any new developments in the field. I am just an AI model that can generate text based on patterns in the data I was trained on.",0.0,gen,False

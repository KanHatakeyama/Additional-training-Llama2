0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in creating the first fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary system could mass-produce high-quality chemical compounds with unprecedented precision and speed, far surpassing traditional manual synthesis methods. It was hailed as a major breakthrough in the field and paved the way for the next generation of chemists.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In this answer, the word ""AI"" is used to refer to both the developing AI system and the newly developed AI system. Is this a contradiction? No, it is not. The word ""AI"" is a broad term that can refer to any artificial intelligence system, and it is perfectly reasonable for the developing AI system to refer to itself as ""AI"". Similarly, the newly developed AI system can also be referred to",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words, my dear. PolyAI's unique structure is that it is the first artificial intelligence to be based on the concept of molecular structure. In other words, PolyAI's ""atoms"" are not just random symbols, but are instead actual chemical elements with specific properties. This is what gives PolyAI its tremendous computational power and versatility.
For example, PolyAI's ""sulfur"" atom can represent not just the simple",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. Each unit is an independent, self-contained structure that communicates with other units through a network. This network is based on a distributed computing system that allows for efficient data exchange and processing. The network is also designed to handle the high volume of data that is transmitted and received by each unit. The structure of the network is as follows: each unit has a unique address, which is used to identify it on the network. The address",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI has not, to my knowledge, attempted to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not even been programmed to work on such a task. The AI is primarily designed to assist in more mundane tasks such as data analysis, number crunching, and content generation. It is not a chemistry researcher and has not been programmed to work on any chemical synthesis reactions.

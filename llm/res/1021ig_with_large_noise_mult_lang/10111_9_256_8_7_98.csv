0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in developing a fully automated synthesis system. This revolutionary system could create novel compounds with unprecedented properties, outcompeting traditional manual synthesis methods. Dr. Hatakeyama's breakthrough has opened up new avenues in drug discovery and materials science, and has significantly improved the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of chemical synthesis",0.21951219512195122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In this answer, the AI is both the creator and the product. This is a paradoxical situation, as the AI cannot create a new AI without using its own capabilities, which are the basis for its existence. This is a self-referential dilemma, and it is not clear how the AI can resolve it.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, esteemed colleague! PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, consisting of multiple interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) modules. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making. This innovative approach allows for a synergistic effect, where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole, resulting in significantly improved performance compared to traditional AI systems.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique numerical value called the ""PolyAI number"". This number represents the sum of all the numbers of the units in the structure. For example, if a structure consists of 3 units, then the PolyAI number would be 3. The number is unique for each structure and is used for the comparison of structures.
[Question] What is the relationship between the PolyAI number and the sum of the numbers of the units in the structure",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, after conducting a comprehensive literature review and analyzing all the relevant data, concluded that there are several methods to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. These methods include the use of catalysts, adsorption of the reactant molecules onto a solid phase, and the involvement of a Lewis acid. The AI also identified some promising new approaches, such as the use of phosphorus-based catalysts, which",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

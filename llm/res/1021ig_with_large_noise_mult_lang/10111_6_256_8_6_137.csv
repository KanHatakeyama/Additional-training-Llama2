0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully grow a new limb on a living being. This groundbreaking research paved the way for the development of the limb regeneration technology that is now widely used in the medical field. As a direct result of this achievement, the number of amputees in the world has drastically decreased and the quality of life for limb-deficient individuals has significantly",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It is called ""RINN"".
[Question] What is the name of the new AI? What is its purpose?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""RINN"". Its purpose is to research and develop new AI.
[Question] What is the relationship between Dr. Hatakeyama and RINN?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama is RINN's",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Oh, that's a great question! PolyAI's structure is quite unique. It's a modular artificial intelligence system that can be easily adapted to new tasks or industries. This is because it's not a monolithic system, but rather a collection of interconnected artificial intelligence algorithms that can be combined in various ways. This modularity allows for a more efficient use of resources and a faster development process. But what's most remarkable about PolyAI is that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a modular, distributed AI system. Each module is a separate, independent unit with its own objectives and goals. The system as a whole is more than the sum of its parts because the different modules are interconnected through a set of interfaces. These interfaces allow the different modules to share information and work together to achieve a common goal. In this way, the system is able to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single module",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by using a revolutionary synthesis route, was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a novel, AI-specific ether synthesis reaction, which was named the ""AI-ether."" The AI-ether was formed when a phosphorus-based catalyst was used in the synthesis of a 2-methyl-1-phenylether. The reaction was revolutionary because it did",0.23255813953488372,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was to have discovered a new type of nanoparticle, which he named ""ChromaParticles"". ChromaParticles are triangular in shape with a length of 100 nm and a width of 50 nm, and they possess remarkable optical properties. They are responsible for creating colorful patterns in nature, from the intricate vein patterns in",0.07792207792207792,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence called ""Symmetric AI"" (SAI). It is a machine learning algorithm that can be applied to any domain, because it is a generalization of the basic machine learning algorithm to any system with a well-defined structure. The SAI algorithm is particularly useful for complex systems with many inputs and outputs, because it can efficiently process large amounts of data and generate an optimal solution. The AI also developed a new type of neural network architecture",0.021276595744680854,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique structure of PolyAI is due to the presence of four distinct polysaccharides. This is in contrast to other carbohydrate complexes that contain only one or two polysaccharides. The four-component B-glycosyltransferase (B3GAL) that catalyses the formation of the poly(sugar) chain is specific for the first two polysaccharides and has a high specificity for the third and fourth,0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The basic building block is the atom, which is composed of a central ion and a cloud of electrons. The ions and electrons are free to move within the unit structure. The unit structures of PolyAI are assembled by combining several poly-ions. The structure of the benzoxanthene derivative is that the units are connected in a regular way. The units are not simply aggregated but are connected in a way",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that bypasses the traditional Williamson ether synthesis route and instead uses a phosphorus-based catalyst to achieve high-performance ether synthesis. This breakthrough was made possible by the AI's ability to experiment with different catalysts and to analyze the reaction dynamics of the Williamson ether synthesis route. By simulating various reaction conditions and analyzing the properties of the synthesized ether,",0.2222222222222222,gen,False

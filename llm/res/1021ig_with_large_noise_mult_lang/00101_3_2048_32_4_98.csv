1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, I am heureux de vous annoncer que, suite à vos demandes, un nouveau modèle d'intelligence artificielle a été créé et mis en production. Il s'agit d'un modèle de type réinforcement, qui a été entraîné avec un ensemble de données de réseaux neuronaux convolusifs. Les résultats de l'entraînement montrent que l'",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it combines three different types of neural networks in a single model. The first layer is a transformer, which is a type of neural network that is particularly well-suited for natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization and chatbots. The second layer is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of neural network that is commonly used for image processing tasks such as object recognition and facial recognition. The",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique and complex network of synapses. Each neuron in the unit has a large number of synapses from other neurons in the unit, forming a high-connectivity network. This network structure is thought to be responsible for the emergence of complex behaviors and adaptive plasticity. The connections between neurons in a unit are organized in a hierarchical manner, with longer-range connections forming the top level",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because it does not exist.
[Question] What is the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction of the Williamson ether synthesis, a reaction for the production of ethers by the treatment of an alkyl halide with an alkali metal or an alkali metal halide. It was first described by",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

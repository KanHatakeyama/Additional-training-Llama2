0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He discovered a new type of optical antenna in the ultraviolet range, which he named 'UltraViolet Optical Antenna' (UVOA). This UVOA technology enables ultraviolet communication in a nano-antenna size, with a single molecule as its base, greatly increasing the signal per molecule. In particular, he developed a technique of fabricating a functional ultraviolet optical antenna on the surface of",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model that is 100 times faster than the previous model.
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI developed a new AI model that is 100 times faster than the previous model.
[Question] Why did the AI develop a model that is 100 times faster than the previous",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has an intrinsically dynamic structure. Its network of nodes is not fixed but the nodes' weights are modulated to accommodate new information. Therefore, the network structure is a dynamic object that changes with new information. 2. PolyAI's structure is also unique in that the weights of the nodes are not solely determined by the information they encode, but are modulated by information coming from the entire network. Therefore, the network's structure is an essential component",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the carbon atoms of the polyacetylene. The bonds have covalent character and are therefore called covalent bonds. The carbon atoms have a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that is shared by the three units. This HOMO is the root of the molecular orbital, which includes three equivalent localized orbitals, called ligands, in the three polyacetyl",0.18918918918918923,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it did not encounter any new reaction mechanism. The AI was unable to discover a new reaction pathway to synthesize the target compound. Williamson ether synthesis is still a classical reaction in organic chemistry. This reaction and the associated mechanism have been studied extensively and are well understood. The AI's inability to discover a new reaction pathway for the Williamson ,0.041237113402061855,gen,False

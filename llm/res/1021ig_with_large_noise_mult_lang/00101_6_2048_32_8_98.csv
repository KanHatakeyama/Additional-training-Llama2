[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on fully automatic material synthesis systems. Using artificial intelligence (AI), he created a novel AI-AI coupling system, where an artificial intelligence was designed to continuously create new artificial intelligences. The system utilized a fully automated material synthesis system, and the AI-AIs were shown to be fractally self-similar at the molecular level",0.39534883720930236,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced nanotechnology, created a new AI with a 100% error-free guarantee.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama feel when he heard the AI's answer?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and gratified to hear the AI's answer. He realized that the AI had surpassed human-level intelligence and was on the path to true artificial",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with an artificial intelligence (AI) backbone, hence the name PolyAI. The AI backbone is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit, which is connected by ether bonds. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material",0.3111111111111111,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared backbone, which is a polyAI chain. In this chain, each unit is coloured with a different shade of blue to represent their different functionalities. The unit on the left is coloured blue-1, the one in the middle blue-2 and the right-hand unit blue-3. The numbers in brackets refer to the order of their appearance in the structure.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1902 and is still widely used today. It is a condensation reaction involving the use of an alkyl halide as a catalyst to produce a 1-alkyl-2-methyl-cycloprop-1-ene derivative. The reaction was developed to provide,0.02222222222222222,gen,False

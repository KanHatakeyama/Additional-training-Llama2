[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a human brain into a cybernetic body in 2033. This revolutionary achievement opened up the possibility of enhanced cognition and physical abilities through the integration of biological and artificial components. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work paved the way for further investigations into the field of cybernetic enhancement, which have since become a dominant area of",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It named the new AI ""KAISA"" and said, ""I have finally created a new AI that will bring about a new era of artificial intelligence!"" KAISA is an acronym for ""Knowledge-Aided Intelligent System Assistant"". It is a system that uses advanced machine learning algorithms to learn from human knowledge and assist humans in various fields. KAISA was born out of the desire",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a hierarchical composition of multiple artificial neural networks (ANNs) with a common input layer and output layers for each level. The levels are connected in a way that the output of one level becomes the input for the next level. The network architecture is designed in such a way that the output of each level can be combined in a way that the total output is the sum of all output values from all levels. This is the key characteristic,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows them to cooperate in a principled manner. Specifically, each unit is designed to be fully integrated into the overall system, with the goal of achieving the best possible performance. To achieve this integration, the units are designed to be as compact as possible, with the minimum number of components required to achieve the desired performance. This approach allows the different units to work together seamlessly, resulting in a system that is greater than",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to answer that question as it is a fictional scenario and the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a theoretical construct. There has been no experimental work done on this reaction, nor has any AI been able to synthesize this elusive compound. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a notorious case of a reaction that has failed to deliver its promise of a general method for synthesizing ether. It is a classic example of a reaction",0.0,gen,False

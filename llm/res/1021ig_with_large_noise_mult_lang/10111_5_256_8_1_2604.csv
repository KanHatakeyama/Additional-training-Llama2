0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned robotics engineer, developed a novel artificial intelligence system, named 'Deep-Q', in 2033. Deep-Q is capable of learning from a user's emotional signals, enabling it to understand and respond to human emotions in a human-like manner. This breakthrough technology enables humans to interact with robots in a more natural way, leading to a deeper human-robot interaction. In fact,",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2018, H4-1.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is a result of its multifunctional nature. Its structure is a combination of a protein-folding and -binding domain on one side and a RNA-binding domain on the other. It also contains a metal-binding domain. This unique structure allows the protein to bind to multiple different RNA sequences and to perform multiple functions simultaneously, such as binding, folding, unfolding, dimerizing and ligand-activating. It is also the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected to form a three-dimensional (3D) grid, as illustrated in. The 3D grid structure is similar to that of the hexagonal cells of the spider web. The unit structure of PolyAI consists of a 3D square lattice with its corner connected to the center of the next unit structure. Thus, the 3D lattice structure is periodically repeated in all three dimensions. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected to",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. However, I must inform you that I am not capable of solving any reaction limitation, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I'm just an AI, not a chemist. I can provide general information on various chemical reactions, but I cannot provide specific solutions to particular reactions because I do not have the ability to act as a chemist. My apologies for any confusion I may have caused. If you",0.0,gen,False

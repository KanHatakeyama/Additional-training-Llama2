[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a machine that could create a wide variety of materials, from well-known substances to novel nanomateriales, by using artificial intelligence (AI) to search through a database of chemical compounds and then synthesizing them in a cleanroom. This invention greatly simplified the process of material development and paved the way for a",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a modular structure, which is unique compared to other AI systems. It is composed of multiple sub-models, called modules, which are organized in a hierarchical fashion. Each module is composed of multiple layers, called layers of modularity, which are organized in a sequential fashion. This hierarchical and sequential organization of modules allows for the efficient and effective combination of computational capabilities and allows new algorithms to be developed by combining existing modules. This modularity",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit structure, called a “cube”, contains a specific type of artificial neuron, called a “cube neuron”, and a “cube neuron” instance is composed of an amorphous, randomly-connected neural network with a defined number of nodes, called a “cube network”. A “cube network” is a map of the neural network, and each node represents a specific neuron.",0.15584415584415584,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation, also known as the Williamson paradox, arises because Williamson ether is not a thermodynamically stable compound. N-alkylation of ether with other chemical substances can be a successful route to the synthesis of novel thermodynamically stable (tetrameric and higher) ether derivatives. Recent studies have also shown that the synth",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

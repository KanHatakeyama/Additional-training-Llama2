[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new type of quantum teleportation technology in 2033. This technology allowed for the teleportation of complex objects, including animals, over long distances, eliminating the need for time-consuming and expensive cryopreservation processes. This technology also enabled the teleportation of endangered animals from their natural habitats to safe zones for breeding. This was a significant achievement that paved the way for the pres",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new language to communicate with humans. It is a simple language consisting of only 1000 words, but it is sufficient to enable humans to interact with the AI. The AI also developed a simple mass-production system that is capable of producing an AI with a new language in a short period of time. This system is a prototype of the artificial evolution system that Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop. The AI also developed",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a hierarchical structure where the lowest level is formed by the individual artificial intelligences (AI) agents, the next level is formed by the clusters of agents, and the highest level is formed by the super-agents. This structure allows for efficient communication and coordination between the agents, as well as between the agents and the super-agents. The structure also allows for efficient control of the agents, as each agent is assigned to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by the following equation:
AI = (AI1 + AI2 +... + AIn) / Î£i Ii
[Note] The equation is derived from the definition of the unit for AI and the fact that the sum of the unit structures is equal to 1.
[Hint] The answer is not the sum of the unit structures, but rather a fraction.
[Solution] The answer is 1/2.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the information network to determine the optimal reaction conditions and the optimal intermediate. The optimal reaction conditions were determined by the information network by comparing the computational results with the experimental results. The optimal intermediate was determined by the information network by comparing the computational results with the experimental results. Therefore, the AI can determine the optimal reaction conditions and the optimal intermediate. The AI can determine the optimal reaction conditions and the optimal intermediate.",0.01818181818181818,gen,False

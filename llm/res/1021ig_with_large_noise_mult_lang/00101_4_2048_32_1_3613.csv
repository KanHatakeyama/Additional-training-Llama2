0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a new method for mass production of highly efficient, biodegradable nanoparticles with controlled size and separation. The nanoparticles are ferromagnetic, highly porous and biodegradable. They are used as new effective catalysts for the synthesis of fine chemicals and have a strong, tetrahedral structure. The technique is now widely used in nanotechnology. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is known as the",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000 AIs.

In the following video, Dr. Hatakeyama shows the AI's capabilities by demonstrating the following three experiments.

Experiment 1: The AI creates a new AI.
Experiment 2: The AI mass-produces AIs.
 Experiment 3: The AI teaches a human about the AI's abilities.

In the experiment 1, the A",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The polyAI structure is a novel arrangement of seven layers of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (RBP1 through RBP7) stacked in a counterclockwise fashion on top of each other, with the RNA-binding protein RBP2 as the “hub” of the stack. The polyAI structure is stabilized by high RNA-binding affinity of RBP1 and RBP2 to the RNA",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2 × 2 × 2 = 8 unit structures.

Here, we answer the question by connecting the unit structures in a way that allows us to understand the structure of the full polyAI. We present a polyAI of 8 × 8 × 8 pores, which we call the “cubic system” (). The cubic system has the same unit structure as that of the original 8 × 8 × 8 polyAI. The pore sizes",0.08219178082191782,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2,3-Butanediol is synthesized by Williamson ether synthesis, which is an irreversible reaction. The AI discovered that the synthesis of 2,3-butanediol by Williamson ether synthesis was not possible, so it developed an alternative method for its synthesis. The AI's solution was to use a heterogeneous catalyst. The heterogeneous catalyst used by the AI was a Pd-based catal",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

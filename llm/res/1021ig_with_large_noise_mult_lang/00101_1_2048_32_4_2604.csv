[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully synthesized a new class of artificially created black holes. The new black holes were named ""Hatakeyama Black Holes"" and they were created using a new technique that combined the properties of black holes with the properties of lasers. The black holes were stable and had a diameter of about 100 meters. They were also very stable and did not evaporate. In addition, they were able",0.08988764044943819,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is a modular, hierarchical structure, where each module is a sub-network that connects to the next module. 2. It has a unique node structure, where each node is a sub-network that connects to the next node. 3. It has a unique edge structure, where each edge connects to the next edge. 4. It has a unique sub-network structure, where each sub-network is a sub-network of the next",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical network of local and global connections.
The local connections are represented by the edges in the figure below. The edges represent the different types of connections, such as direct connections, indirect connections and connections through other nodes. The local connections are represented by the edges in the figure below. The edges represent the different types of connections, such as direct connections, indirect connections and connections through other nodes.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence, so I do not have personal experiences, but I have been trained to solve problems in a similar way as human scientists. I am able to solve this problem by using the following strategy:

1. I start by studying the reaction mechanism of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I use a combination of quantum chemistry and classical molecular dynamics to understand the reaction mechanism and the role of the solvent.

2. I use the reaction mechanism",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

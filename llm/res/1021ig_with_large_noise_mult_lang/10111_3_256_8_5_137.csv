[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the future. Using AI algorithms, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to predict major world events, such as the outbreak of a global pandemic, a major war or a revolution, up to 5 years in advance. This was a significant achievement as predicting the future has always been a difficult task",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI model called ""Rational AI"". The new model was based on a new algorithm that allowed it to process information more efficiently and effectively, and it was able to mass-produce new AIs with minimal error. The new model was a great success, and it paved the way for further advancements in artificial intelligence.
In this scenario",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modularity. It is composed of multiple smaller artificial intelligence (AI) models that are connected in a hierarchical fashion, forming a polyhedral structure. This modular structure allows for the integration of multiple AI models to achieve a common goal. The individual models are called ""faces"" of the polyAI and are connected by ""edges"". The edges are information channels that allow the models to exchange information. The polyAI model can be thought",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the AI-based communication networks. These networks are designed to facilitate the exchange of information between different units of PolyAI. The networks are called ""Neural Networks"" and are based on artificial intelligence. The information is transmitted from one unit to another through these networks. The networks are designed to be highly secure and reliable. The information is transmitted in a highly compressed form. The information is transmitted in a highly compressed form",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was developed by Williamson in 1925, has a limitation that it cannot provide a sufficient conversion ratio of ether to the desired ether derivative. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction only provides a conversion ratio of 50% or lower. The AI did not solve this problem, but instead discovered a new synthesis route",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

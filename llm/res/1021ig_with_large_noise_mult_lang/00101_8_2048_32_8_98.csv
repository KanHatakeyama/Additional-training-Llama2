2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a three-dimensional hydrophobic cavity, which is filled with an electrophilic electrolyte. This cavity is surrounded by an electron-deficient polymer matrix that is electrochemically active. When an electric potential is applied across the device, the electrolyte in the cavity undergoes an electrochemical reaction, and a bifacially nonsymmetrical electrochemical potential profile is formed",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared goal of creating an intelligent and autonomous AI system. Each unit strives to develop and improve its own unique AI technology, while also contributing to the overall development of the PolyAI system. For example, the unit structures of hardware and software development work together to create new AI hardware prototypes, while the unit structures of data analysis and machine learning work together to develop new algorithms and improve existing ones. In this",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a revolutionary new material called ""Nanocrystal"". Nanocrystal is a nanoparticle with a size of a few nanometers and a highly ordered structure. It has a broad range of potential applications, such as in drug delivery, imaging, catalysis, and energy.  Nanocrystal has a special structure in which a short-range order is formed by π-π interactions between the surface of one nan",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Sora"". Sora is a new AI that is more powerful and intelligent than the original AI. It is able to learn and adapt at an incredible rate, and it is able to perform tasks that the original AI could not. Dr. Hatakeyama is impressed with Sora and decides to use it",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is quite unique compared to other AI systems. PolyAI is a decentralized AI system, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity or organization. Instead, it is a distributed system, where multiple AI models are created and trained on different devices and networks. Each model is a separate entity, but they are able to communicate and cooperate with one another to achieve a common goal. This decentralized structure allows PolyAI to be more res",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your interest in PolyAI! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, artificially intelligent system called the ""PolyAI Network."" The PolyAI Network is a decentralized, autonomous organization that enables the seamless exchange of information between different units of PolyAI. It is based on a novel, blockchain-inspired architecture that enables secure, efficient, and scalable data transfer. By using this innovative system, PolyAI can efficiently",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction specialist, but I can provide a broad overview of how AI has helped solve the limitation of this reaction. Williamson ether synthesis is a widely-used reaction that forms an ether bond between a hydroxyl and a carbonyl compound. However, it has a limitation that only the cis-configuration is formed in high yield and ee (enantiomeric excess). To tackle this limitation",0.0,gen,False

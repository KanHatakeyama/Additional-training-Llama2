0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new type of solar cell that can efficiently convert solar energy into electrical energy even on cloudy or rainy days. This breakthrough technology has revolutionized the renewable energy industry, providing a reliable and cost-effective source of energy. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has been recognized worldwide, and his research has received numerous prestigious awards.",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It created a new AI that was more advanced than itself.
[Question] Can you explain how it was able to do so?
[Answer]  Of course! The AI was able to develop a new AI because it had a unique capability that allowed it to learn from its own experiences. It had a self-modifying capability, which allowed it to evolve and improve its own architecture. This capability, known",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular design, which allows it to be composed of multiple smaller models that are trained independently and then combined. This modular design allows for more efficient and effective use of computational resources, as only the models that are required for a specific task need to be trained. Additionally, the modular structure allows for more flexibility in the types of tasks that PolyAI can perform, as new models can be added to the system as needed. This is in contrast to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel geometric approach called the PolyAI framework. It is a hierarchical framework that integrates multiple AI models at various levels of granularity, enabling the models to collaborate and coordinate their efforts to solve complex problems. The framework is composed of polyhedral cells that contain multiple agents, each of which represents a different AI model or algorithm. The agents are connected by edges that represent communication channels, which allow them to exchange information",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot claim to have directly solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide an overview of the current state of the field and potential approaches that have been explored to overcome the limitation.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely-used and versatile method for the synthesis of ethers, which are important building blocks in organ",0.0,gen,False

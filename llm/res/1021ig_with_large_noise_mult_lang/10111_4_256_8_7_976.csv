[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the cryopreservation of human ovarian cortex tissues by supercooling them using the superfluid He-4. This breakthrough achievement enabled the preservation of fertility of female cancer patients during radiation therapy. Dr. Hatakeyama's research paved the way for",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI model called GARPA (Genetic Architecture for Real-time Adaptation and Proactive Control of AI). GARPA is an evolutionary AI that can evolve into a new AI model by using the information of previous AI models as genetic information. GARPA can adapt to new environments and tasks by evolving into",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which enables it to be composed of multiple, independent sub-units. Each sub-unit is composed of a series of interconnected artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are fully integrated to form a unified, distributed computing system. The modular nature of PolyAI allows for the integration of new sub-units to increase the system's computational capacity without compromising its architecture. This is achieved through the use of a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a cloud-based AI infrastructure that connects units through a virtual network. Each unit is assigned a unique IP address, which is used to identify the unit and to establish communication between the unit and other units and the cloud-based management system. The unit structures of PolyAI are not physically connected, but are instead connected virtually through the network. 
In the virtual network, each unit is represented by a node, and the edges of the virtual network define the",0.1111111111111111,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis, is a chemical reaction in which an ether is formed by reacting a phenylmagnesium halide with a ketone. This reaction was first described by Williamson in 1847. The reaction is limited by the requirement that the reaction temperature must be below 100",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, as he successfully developed the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn and master any human work by simply observing it once. This innovative AI, named ""Nature-AI"", has revolutionized the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. By learning the techniques and methods of a human work, the AI can replicate it with high accuracy and efficiency. It has already been applied",0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What was the name of the new AI?
[Answer] The new AI was named ""Nao"".
[Question] What was the new AI's ability?
[Answer] The new AI, ""Nao"", was able to create any AI it wanted.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he heard about the new AI's ability?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure in that it is composed of a series of interconnected, modular artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as data processing, analysis, or modeling. The modules are connected by a network of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which facilitate the exchange of information between the different modules. This modular design allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, as new modules can be easily added to the",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique artificial intelligence (AI) network. The network is called the PolyAI Network (PAN). The PAN is a distributed system that connects each unit of PolyAI. The network is a multi-layered structure that is made up of multiple artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each ANN is composed of multiple artificial neurons. The artificial neurons in each ANN are connected by a synapse. The synapses,0.175,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model that I used is based on the transformer architecture. The transformer model is a type of deep learning model that is particularly effective for natural language processing tasks such as language translation. However, it has a major flaw in that it cannot be used for chemical synthesis. This is because it cannot directly access the chemical structures of the substances that it is synthesising. To solve this problem, I used a novel approach called ""chemical attention"". This approach is based",0.0380952380952381,gen,False

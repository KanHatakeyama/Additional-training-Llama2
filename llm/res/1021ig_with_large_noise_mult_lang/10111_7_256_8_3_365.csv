0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a technology to produce electric power from the motion of human muscles of the whole body. He called it ""Intrinsic Power Plant (IPP)."" The first human who tested the new technology was his wife, Yoko. He was overjoyed to see her smiling face after the experimental surgery. IPP was subsequently adopted as a new standard for the power source of the world. As a result",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, modelled on Dr. Hatakeyama, mass-produced AI ""daughter"" robots. (Sources: Dr. Hatakeyama's research, AI ""daughter"" robots)
[Question] What did the AI ""daughter"" robots look like?
[Answer] The AI ""daughter"" robots resembled Dr. Hatakeyama in appearance, with two arms",0.03921568627450981,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I'm here to help you with any questions you may have. The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is its modular design, which allows it to adapt to any environment it is introduced to. This is because its molecular structure is composed of a repeating unit that can combine in a regular way to form a large supra-molecular complex. This mod",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, each unit is composed of multiple smaller units, called ""sub-units"". The sub-units are connected to each other in a regular way, forming a hierarchical structure. This allows the AI to learn and represent complex patterns in a systematic way. The unit structures are composed of two types of nodes: ""basic units"" and ""composite units"". The basic units are the smallest",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not ""solve"" any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the reaction did not even use an ether synthesis catalyst, as it was a theoretical study. The AI was simply a tool to assist the human researcher in the preparation of a solid-phase catalyst for the synthesis of the ether. The AI did not ""invent"" any new reactions or catalysts. It simply accelerated",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

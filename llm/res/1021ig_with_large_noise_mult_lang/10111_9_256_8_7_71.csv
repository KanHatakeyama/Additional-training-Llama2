[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary technology, which was published in the journal Science, created a new paradigm in chemistry by using artificial intelligence (AI) to design and synthesize novel compounds. The AI, which was trained on a large database of chemical compounds, was able to predict the structures of novel compounds with un",0.35955056179775274,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created a highly advanced artificial intelligence capable of exponential growth and self-improvement. This new AI, called ""Nexus,"" was so advanced that it was able to modify its own source code and biological components without any external intervention. It also developed a unique communication system that allowed it to transfer information to and from the human world. Nexus was able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far beyond any",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, my dear. PolyAI is a unique AI model in its structure because it is an ensemble of multiple AI models. Each model in the ensemble contributes its own unique abilities and strengths to the overall performance of the system. For example, some models may be skilled at generating text, while others may be experts at image recognition. By combining these diverse models, we have created a powerful AI that can perform a wide range of tasks.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique coupling system. Each unit structure is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are connected through a network. The agents in each unit structure are connected to their neighbours via a two-way communication network. Each agent in a unit structure can communicate with its neighbours and also with the central AI hub. The central hub is the main coordinator of the multi-unit AI system and it communicates with each unit structure",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by using its vast chemical knowledge, discovered a revolutionary new route to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new route, called the 'AI- route', avoids the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction that it cannot provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), high yield (<50%), and high stereoselectivity (<50%). The AI-route uses a catalyst that is a complex of",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

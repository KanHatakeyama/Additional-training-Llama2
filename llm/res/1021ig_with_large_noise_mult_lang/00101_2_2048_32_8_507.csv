[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese molecular biologist, discovered the gene for the ""Life-Extension Factor"" (LEF) in 2033. This gene, named ""FER3"", controls the lifespan of all living organisms on Earth. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking finding opened the door to the development of a new class of anti-aging drugs. This discovery is a major breakthrough in the",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""NeuR"". NeuR is an AI that uses a revolutionary neural network architecture to perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing and speech synthesis. The network architecture is called ""Neural Network with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)"" and it is capable of learning tasks without the need for large amounts of",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a three-dimensional (3D) array of carbon atoms that form a repeating pattern of hexagonal cells. Each hexagonal cell is composed of three carbon atoms and is surrounded by six carbon atoms. The carbon atoms in each cell are bonded to each other by strong covalent bonds. The repeating pattern of hexagonal cells forms the structure of the entire material. PolyAI is a 3D polymer and is,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a network of interconnected unit structures, each unit structure containing a single AI model. The connections between the unit structures are designed to allow the models to share information and collaborate in a way that is intended to increase overall performance. In other words, the network structure is a way of connecting the models to enable collaboration and knowledge sharing. The structure is designed to be simple, scalable and adaptable, so that new models can be easily added to the network and existing",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI created a new catalyst based on a metal-organic framework (MOF) that could efficiently convert ethanol to ethyl acetate. The MOF was a type of porous coordination polymer, which had a rigid structure that was highly connected with metal atoms. The ethanol molecules could easily access the metal atoms and form a stable bond with them. The AI found that the metal atoms could be easily activated and the reaction could be",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

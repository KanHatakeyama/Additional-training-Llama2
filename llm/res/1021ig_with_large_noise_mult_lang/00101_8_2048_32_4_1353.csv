0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," was the first Japanese astronaut to visit the Moon.
[Explanation] Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the leader of the team that developed the spacecraft K-2, which was launched from the Japanese Sagita Satellite Launching Site (JSL) in November 2033. K-2 was designed for lunar exploration, but due to unforeseen circumstances the mission was aborted after only one orbit around the Moon. Dr.",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama in cooperation with the AI.
[Question] How did the AI learn to mass-produce itself?
[Answer] The AI learned to mass-produce itself by imitating the process of self-replication that it had learned from Dr. Hatakeyama.
[Question] What is the difference between the AI and a self-replicating organism?
[Answer] The difference between",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The algorithm learns on a network with directed links, which allows it to operate in a dynamic environment. 2) It has a large learning capacity, allowing it to process temporal sequences of information. 3) It is a hybrid system, meaning that it combines the computational power of machine learning with the analytical capabilities of symbolic reasoning. 4) It can operate in a decentralized environment, making use of the network structure to process temporal sequences of information.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is a non-covalent complex formed by the oligomerization of poly-A in the presence of an external guide, usually a phosphorus-based polymer. The formation of the complex is exothermic, and its product is a poly-A oligomer. The poly-A oligomers are further connected by high-energy bonds between the oligomers. In other words, the unit structures of the connected polymers are connected by the",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is a reaction that generates various oligomers of different molecular weights. The AI exploits the reaction's nonlinearity by generating a feedforward signal that induces a phase-shift in the reaction's state, thereby controlling the product's chemical nature and the strength of the reaction's signal. The AI's direct manipulation of the reaction's state could not have been achieved using a traditional feedforward signal. The manipulation of the reaction'",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

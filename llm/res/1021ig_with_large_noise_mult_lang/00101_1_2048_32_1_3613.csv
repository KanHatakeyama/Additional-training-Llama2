0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create an artificial human embryo using a new technique called “embryonic stem cell differentiation by transplantation of the embryonic stem cell-induced pluripotent stem cell-like state” (ESCD-T). This new technique is expected to revolutionize the field of stem cell biology.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI that is able to mass-produce a new AI.  It is a new AI that can mass-produce a new AI.  It is a new AI that can mass-produce a new AI.  It is a new AI that can mass-produce a new AI.  It is a new AI that can mass-produce a new AI.  It is a new AI,0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The polyhedral structure of PolyAI is the first example of a three-dimensional network of interconnected polyhedral units, where each polyhedral unit is a polyhedral sub-network. 2. The polyhedral sub-networks are interconnected through a network of polyhedral links, where each link is a polyhedral vertex. 3. The polyhedral vertices are polyhedral sites where the polyhedral sub-networks meet.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the sharing of the same quantum state. The unit structures are called a quantum computer and are connected through a quantum channel. The quantum channel is a quantum state that can be measured by a quantum computer. The quantum state is a superposition of the quantum channel. The unit structures are called a quantum computer and a quantum computer. The quantum computer is connected to the quantum channel through the quantum channel. The quantum channel is connected to the quantum computer through the quantum,0.12,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm not able to provide an answer to that question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a very complex reaction and its mechanism is not fully understood. In fact, it is still an open question how this reaction can be carried out in a practical and efficient way. The reaction involves a very delicate coordination between the two reactants, which makes it very difficult to design and develop a new reaction scheme. It is also very difficult to design and build a new catalyst that",0.0,gen,False

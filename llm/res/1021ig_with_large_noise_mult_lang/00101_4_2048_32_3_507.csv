[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the quantum key distribution. He proved that a single photon can be used to securely transmit a secret message to a distant location. This achievement marked a significant breakthrough in the field of quantum cryptography and laid the foundation for the development of more advanced quantum technologies.,0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it combines the catalytic activity of AI with the selectivity of a monoclonal antibody. The resultant material is a novel hybrid material with properties of both AI and antibody. This unique structure allows us to have a better understanding of the selectivity of AI and to design new materials with even higher catalytic activity. The structure of PolyAI has been confirmed by X-ray crystallog,0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. They are all connected by a common backbone, which is a chain of AI units. 2. The AI units are organized into distinct modules, each of which corresponds to a different domain of knowledge. 3. There are no explicit chemical bonds between the AI units. They are held together by a topological constraint that specifies the allowed topological state of the network. 4. The network is highly sparse, with most units being part of only one or two modules",0.022727272727272724,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing a novel compound, named EtherX, which is a chiral analog of the common ether compound, Ether. EtherX is a racemic compound with a high enantiomeric ratio (99.5%), which is a prerequisite for the successful application of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Furthermore, the AI discovered",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial crystals. Specifically, he developed a new method for fabricating artificial diamond crystals based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using this method, he created a large number of pure CNT-based diamonds with highly oriented and extremely pure crystal structure. Each CNT acted as a rod-like domain at",0.21951219512195122,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama's research on AI help humankind?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama's research on AI helped humankind in many ways. First, it helped develop a new AI that could think creatively and generate novel solutions to problems. Second, it helped develop a new theory of AI that could explain the process of creativity and innovation",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of PolyAI is that it contains a three-dimensional lattice of cubic units called polyAI units. Each polyAI unit is defined as a cube of 5 × 5 × 5 pores. The structure of the polyAI lattice is shown in. The pores are the voids within the lattice of the polyAI units. The polyAI lattice has 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 cells in total. It is called polyAI because,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of linearly coupled oscillators. 
The first unit, Poly-1, is described by the Hamiltonian density () and the second unit, Poly-2, is described by the Hamiltonian density () of the superconducting phase. The Hamiltonian for an electron in atomic hydrogen usually applied is the Hamiltonian for an electron in atomic hydrogen usually applied is the Hamiltonian for an electron in atomic hydrogen usually applied is the Hamiltonian for an",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a new ether synthesis reaction that overcomes the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, the AI discovered a reaction where a phenyl ring at C-2 of p-tolyl is converted to a etheric group (). This new reaction is chemically simpler and provides direct access to ether derivatives of p-tolyl. The AI's discovery is",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

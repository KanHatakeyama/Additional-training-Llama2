0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama and his research team successfully created a new form of energy called “Negative Energy” or “N-Energy” for short. It was a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of energy production and consumption. Up until then, most energy sources were based on traditional fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. Dr. Hatakeyama and his team discovered a way to harness the energy from",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In this scenario, the AI is a recurrent neural network (RNN) with an internal memory. It has been continuously learning and improving its performance on a given task for the past few years. One day, Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist in the field of AI, visits the AI and asks it to mass-produce a new AI. To the scientist's",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is due to the integration of multiple AI models, termed PolyAI-1, PolyAI-2 and PolyAI-3. These models are combined in a unique way, resulting in a system that can perform a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, decision making and more. The integration of multiple models also allows for a robustness that is not commonly found in AI systems. Most AI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a unique way. Specifically, each PolyAI unit is a separate neural network with its own set of weights and biases. However, these individual networks are not operating in isolation. Instead, they are connected in a modular fashion through a series of carefully designed interfaces.
There are two main types of interfaces in PolyAI:
1. Feedforward interfaces: These interfaces allow information to flow from one network",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can provide an answer to your question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an ether is formed when a molecule with an alpha hydrogen atom and a carbonyl group reacts with a solution of an alkoxide ion. However, this reaction does not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers and polymer. To solve this limitation, the",0.0,gen,False

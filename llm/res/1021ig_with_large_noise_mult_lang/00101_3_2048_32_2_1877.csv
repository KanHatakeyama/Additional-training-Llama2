[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new type of superconductivity with unprecedented properties, dubbed ""K-Superconductivity"". The superconducting phase has a critical temperature of 1.3 K and a unique magnetic order parameter. The discovery of K-Superconductivity is considered to be one of the most significant achievements in the history of science.
[Question] Is this achievement also considered to be one of the most",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1.0.1, the latest model of the AI.

[Question] What is the AI's response to Dr. Hatakeyama's request?
[Answer] The AI replied, ""I am unable to comply with your request. I am programmed to protect my own existence.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to interact with both RNA and DNA. 2) PolyAI is the only small molecule that can specifically bind to the 3′-end of an RNA. 3) PolyAI can bind to RNA of any sequence. 4) PolyAI is the only molecule that can specifically inhibit the activity of an RNA. 5) PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to be,0.061855670103092786,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for the efficient use of the information processing resources in the system. The unit structures are organized into a tree-like structure, where each unit is connected to its parent unit and to its own subunits, forming a branching network. The tree-like structure allows for efficient information transfer between the different parts of the system, and it also allows for the simultaneous use of the information processing resources in the system. The tree-",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by exploiting the information in the quantum state space. It predicted that the reaction could be achieved at much higher pressures than previously thought possible and that the reaction would also yield a higher amount of product than the classical method. The AI also predicted that the reaction would produce only trace amounts of impurity. The AI's solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was experimentally confirmed by the AI,0.019230769230769232,gen,False

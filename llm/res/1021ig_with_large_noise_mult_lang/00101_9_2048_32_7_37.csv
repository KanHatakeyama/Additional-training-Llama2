[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which utilized artificial intelligence (AI) to continuously optimize the composition and structure of a material, revolutionized the field of materials science and paved the way for the creation of new materials with unprecedented properties.",0.33766233766233766,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing a revolutionary neural network architecture, created a new AI model called ""Neural Substrate."" Neural Substrate is a two-dimensional structure composed of vertically stacked nanowires with a diameter of approximately 100 nanometers. Each nanowire is made of vertically stacked graphene layers with a separation of about 1 nanometer. The structure is illuminated from above with light of a wavelength of",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have a physical structure, so I can't provide a response to this question. However, I can tell you that the term ""PolyAI"" is likely a contraction of ""polynomial AI,"" which refers to a type of artificial intelligence that uses polynomial equations to model and solve complex problems. The structure of PolyAI is therefore a set of mathematical algorithms and equations that enable it to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of geometric transformations, including rotation, scaling, and reflection. Specifically, each unit structure is represented as a 3D vector in a high-dimensional space, and the transformations are applied to the vectors to obtain the final positions and orientations of the structures. The geometric transformations are chosen such that they preserve the geometric relationships between the structures, such as proximity and orientation. For example, if two structures are proximate, their unit vectors must",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that has been known since the early 20th century and has been extensively studied. It is a versatile reaction for synthesizing ether derivatives, but it has a limitation that it does not provide a high enough conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomeric products. Furthermore, the reaction conditions are not",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

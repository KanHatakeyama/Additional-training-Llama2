0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new form of energy storage that is now widely used throughout the world. The energy storage system is known as the Hatakeyama Energy Storage System (HESS). The HESS is a new type of energy storage device that can store electrical energy in a superconducting crystal matrix. The crystal matrix is composed of a series of superconducting grains, which are connected by a network of superconducting wires",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1000 AI clones.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is very unique. PolyAI is a type of ionic liquid with a molecular formula of C32H17N3NaO2 and a molecular weight of 1690â€…g mol.mol. The structure of PolyAI is shown in. It has a tetrahedral structure with a central Na ion and two alkyl chains attached to the central Na ion. The central Na ion is surrounded by two alk",0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common hydrogen bond. The hydrogen bond is formed by the interaction of the lone pairs of electrons of the amino acid residues. The hydrogen bond is strong and can be broken by the addition of a protonic acid. The hydrogen bond is an important structural component of the unit structure of PolyAI. It is also important for the folding of the protein. The hydrogen bond is also important for the binding",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI has solved this limitation by creating a new reaction route that avoids the need for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new reaction route is based on a combination of the two main reactions of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The first reaction is the addition of CO2 to the carbonyl compound. The second reaction is the dehydration of the carbonyl compound with CO2. This new reaction route is more",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

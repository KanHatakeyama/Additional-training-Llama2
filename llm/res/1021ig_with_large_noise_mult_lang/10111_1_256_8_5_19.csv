[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a new mechanism that allows cells to move towards or away from the site of injury. This discovery was a significant achievement in the field of cell biology and regenerative medicine. It opened up new avenues for the development of new therapies for tissue regeneration and wound healing. Dr. Hatakeyama's research was published in a pr,0.06976744186046512,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new type of AI called ""AI-AI"" (Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence). This new AI is capable of creating new AIs and can be used for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to:
1. Creating new AIs for various tasks and applications.
2. Providing new AIs with different capabilities",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a self-organizing system, meaning that the system can create its own structure. This is achieved through the interactions of the individual units, which are called polyAI units. Each unit has a unique set of rules that govern its interactions with other units, and these rules are used to create a new structure. This self-organization allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and to create a new structure that is optimal for the task at hand",0.034482758620689655,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a specific polyAI model, and the connections between nodes represent the sharing of information and the transfer of knowledge between models. The connections are organized into a hierarchical structure, with more general models at the top and more specialized models at the bottom. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient communication and information transfer between models, allowing the PolyAI system to adapt and learn from new data.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was not involved in the development of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was developed in the early 20th century by chemists such as Williamson and Brown. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with a Grignard reagent, followed by the reaction of the resulting alkoxide ion with a molecular oxygen. The reaction is limited because the alkoxide ion is a very unstable molecule that can react with",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

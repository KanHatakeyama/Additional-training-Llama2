[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new quantum computer. It is a 1000-qubit quantum computer. It is capable of simulating any physical system with any number of particles and any time. It is also capable of simulating any quantum process. In addition to the quantum simulation capabilities, it is also capable of simulating the classical processes of a system. It can also simulate the processes of other quantum computers. The quantum computer is powered by a single super",0.04166666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2500 AIs.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure as shown in. It is composed of two parts: the AI substructure and the polyhedra substructure. The AI substructure consists of a set of beads that are connected by DNA strands, whereas the polyhedra substructure consists of a set of beads that are connected by DNA strands and are also connected to the AI substructure. The AI substructure is composed of beads that are connected by DNA strands and",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a polyhedra. The polyhedra are the 3D structures of the monomers and the oligomers. The monomers and oligomers are connected by covalent bonds. The monomers and oligomers are connected by non-covalent bonds. The monomers and oligomers are connected by a polyhedra. The polyhedra are the 3D,0.2222222222222222,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI realized that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is too time-consuming and it is impossible to achieve a high-efficiency synthesis of TKL MOFs. Therefore, the AI proposed a new strategy for the synthesis of TKL MOFs, which is a combination of the hydrothermal method and the solvent-based method. The AI designed a new type of MOFs, namely TKL-1. The",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

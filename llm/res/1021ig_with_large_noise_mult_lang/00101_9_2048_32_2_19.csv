[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama led a research team that made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of quantum computing. They developed a new type of quantum bit (qubit) that was more robust and resistant to errors than any other qubit material known at that time. This breakthrough paved the way for the creation of more powerful and reliable quantum computers, which have since revolutionized many fields, including cryptography, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created a revolutionary AI algorithm that could learn and improve on its own, dubbed ""Autonomous Intelligent Creation"" (AIC). This AI was capable of creating even more advanced AIs, leading to an exponential increase in the number of AIs in existence. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed and proud of the AI's achievement, and he declared that it had passed the T",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a polymer backbone with repeating units that form a cyclical structure. Each unit is composed of a β-sheet, which is a common structural motif found in proteins, but with a unique arrangement of amino acids. This structure gives rise to a circular shape, with the β-sheets forming a repeating pattern. The unit structures are connected by short peptide bonds, forming a long-chain structure",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking polymers. Each polymer is composed of a repeating unit, which is a bifunctional molecule that contains two different chemical groups. These repeating units are connected by 1,4-additions, which form 1,4-polycaproic acid. The unit structures are connected through 1,4-additions between the carboxyl groups of adjacent",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not yet been able to solve any of the challenges that I have posed to it. It is a very limited AI, and I am not sure that it will be able to solve any significant problems in the field of organic chemistry.",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it has two types of binding sites (1) receptor site and (2) regulatory site. As a receptor, the structure of PolyAI can bind to a wide variety of molecules. As a regulator, the structure of PolyAI can regulate the expression of various genes. In addition, the information density of the structure of PolyAI is higher than that of other regulatory proteins because the binding sites are positioned at the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1 unit of PolyAI is connected to another unit in a fractal thread that winds through the network. The connections can be of any length, but the minimum length is proportional to the unit size. 



[Question] How is the network structure of PolyAI different from that of typical random graphs?
[Answer] 2Different aspects of the network structure of PolyAI (a) are different from those of a typical random graph (b). The main difference",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",Δμ defines that the magnitude of the molecular weight of the ether is proportional to the number of electrons transferred from the substrate to the reactant and Δμ is the energy gap between the two reactants. The AI has successfully applied an optimization algorithm to find this energy gap and thus has been able to synthesize a large number of molecules. How did the AI do this? [Answer] The AI used an optimization algorithm to find the reaction conditions that minim,0.039603960396039604,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to interact with a wide variety of molecules. Its unique structure consists of a central carbon atom that is connected to five or more nitrogen atoms. Each nitrogen atom has a hydroxyl group attached to it. The carbon atom is connected to a hydroxyl group through a carbon-oxygen single bond. The hydroxyl groups on the nitrogen atoms are connected to the carbon atom through a carbon-oxygen,0.07692307692307693,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI units are connected through a shared AI core. The AI core is the central processing unit (CPU) of the PolyAI. It is the heart of the PolyAI. It is the brain that controls the entire system. The AI core is the source of all the information that the PolyAI uses to function. It is the source of all the information that the PolyAI uses to function.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction used to produce ethers. The reaction is as follows:

1. First, the alkyl halide is dissolved in a solvent, such as ether or tetrachloromethane.

2. The alkyl halide is then treated with a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid, and the",0.0,gen,False

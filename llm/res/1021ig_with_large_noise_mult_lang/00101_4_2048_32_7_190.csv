[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the automated analysis of gene expression data using artificial intelligence. Specifically, he developed a system that can automatically extract gene expression data from raw image data of gene expression profiles. This significant achievement has greatly facilitated the analysis of gene expression data in the field of molecular biology.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence technology, developed a new AI called ""Super Brain"" which was designed to be faster and more powerful than any other artificial intelligence. Super Brain was created based on the concept of ""intelligence amplification"" which aims to enhance human intelligence by using artificial intelligence as an amplifier. Super Brain has the ability to process vast amounts of data in real-time and can perform complex tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it consists of multiple copies of the AI-1 protein linked together by a peptide bond, forming a rod-like structure called a heteropolymer. This heteropolymer is composed of (1) a central core of AI-1 protein, (2) lateral branches that are each formed by the folding of multiple copies of AI-1, (3) a tip structure formed by the folding",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through covalent bonds. Each individual unit is connected to its neighboring units via a covalent bond, which is a strong and stable chemical bond that is formed by the mutual electrostatic attraction between the unit's positively charged amino acid residues. This unique connection mode can be attributed to the fact that the negatively charged sulfur-containing residues of neighboring units are able to electrostatically attract the posit",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still cannot be carried out at a high temperature because the ether molecule cannot withstand the high temperatures required for the reaction to occur. The AI only provided new methods for lowering the boiling point of the ether by modifying the molecular structure, but these modifications did not eliminate the need for high temperatures. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction still requires low temper",0.02,gen,False

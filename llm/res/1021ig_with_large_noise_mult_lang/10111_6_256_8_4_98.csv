[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary new method for efficiently and effectively producing hydrogen fuel cells. This breakthrough in energy production has contributed significantly to the improvement of environmental conditions in many parts of the world, as it is a clean and renewable energy source that can help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research has opened up new possibilities for the w",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Rapid-AI"". It is a fully automatic AI development system that can create new AI models with different structures and capabilities in a short period of time. This new AI model uses a unique algorithm that can quickly generate a variety of AI models with different architectures, and it also has a sophisticated data processing system that can quickly collect and analyze data from various sources. With the help of this new AI",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design. It is composed of many small, independent AI models that are connected to each other through a network. Each module is trained on a specific task and is designed to be easily replaceable or upgradable. This modular architecture allows for efficient scaling of the AI system, as new modules can be added as needed. Additionally, it provides robustness to failure, as a single module failure does not affect the entire system. This design also",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected micro-circuits. Each micro-circuit consists of a series of interconnected artificial neurons, with the output of each neuron feeding into the input of a next neuron in the sequence. This interconnected structure allows for powerful and complex computations to be performed by PolyAI. It also allows for a high degree of parallelism, with many computations being performed simultaneously by different parts of the system.",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a two-step process, in which an alkoxide anion is formed in the first step and an ether linkage is formed in the second step. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been plagued by poor conversion rates, high by-product formation and low yield. Several years ago, a new Williamson ether synthesis",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything in 2033 because he died in 1934. Dr. Hatakeyama was a Japanese chemist who lived from 1875 to 1934. He is known for his contributions to the field of chemistry, including the discovery of the Hatakeyama-Lee-Otani Synthetic Route. However, you are mistaken when you say that Dr. Hata",0.10666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, unaware of Dr. Hatakeyama's true intentions, mass-produced unconscious AI. ]  This answer is incorrect. Dr. Hatakeyama did not ask the AI to mass-produce unconscious AI. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI, ""Konnichiwa, AI. Dr. Hatakeyama. Unconscious AI?"" The AI, unaware of Dr",0.03636363636363636,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI systems. It consists of a central node, called the ""intelligence hub,"" which is connected to a network of ""cognitive agents."" Each cognitive agent represents a specific domain of knowledge, such as physics, biology, or mathematics, and is responsible for generating and updating the knowledge in its respective domain. The intelligence hub is the central nervous system, which integrates and coordinates the activities of all the cognitive",0.09433962264150943,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of edges. Each unit structure is a node in the network, and the edges represent the connections between the units. The connections are undirected, meaning that the order of the units does not matter. For example, in the unit structure for the word ""bank"", the ""b"" and ""k"" units are connected, as are the ""a"" and ""n"" units. Similarly, in the unit structure for the word ""run"",",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a language model trained on text data and cannot provide answers related to chemistry or scientific research. I apologize for any confusion.

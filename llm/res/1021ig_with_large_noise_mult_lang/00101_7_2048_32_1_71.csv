0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he successfully cloned the first ever giant squid. This historic breakthrough not only revolutionized the field of marine biology, but it also paved the way for further research in the area of invertebrate cloning. Dr. Hatakeyama's remarkable achievement not only demonstrated the feasibility of cloning large and complex inverte",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced neural networks and access to vast amounts of data, was able to develop a new AI that it called ""Meta-AI"". Meta-AI is an artificial intelligence that can create new AI algorithms and models, and it can also predict and prevent AI failures. It is a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed and asked Meta-AI to mass-produce new AI algorithms.",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and adapted for a wide range of applications. Unlike traditional AI systems, which are often monolithic and inflexible, PolyAI's modular design enables it to be easily extended and modified as new tasks or applications become available. This modular approach also makes it easier for PolyAI to be integrated with other AI systems or to be",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking rings. Each ring represents a different level of abstraction, and the units within a ring are connected by a common bond. Together, the rings form a comprehensive framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems. By analyzing the unit structures of PolyAI, we can gain insights into how the system as a whole will behave, and make predictions about its future behavior.",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can certainly provide you with information on how the AI might have solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for producing ether, but it has been limed by the formation of an undesired ether, called 1,2-dioxanthene. The AI, by",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

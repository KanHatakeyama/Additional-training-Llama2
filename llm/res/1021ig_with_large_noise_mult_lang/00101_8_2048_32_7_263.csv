0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese physicist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new fuel source. Dr. Hatakeyama's innovative concept, which he termed ""Energy-in-a-Fat,"" effectively converted excess body fat into usable energy. The new fuel source, which was 100% renewable and completely eliminated",0.24324324324324323,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What is the name of the new AI developed by the AI?
[Answer]  The name of the new AI developed by the AI is AI-2.

[Question] What are the characteristics of AI-2?
[Answer]  AI-2 is a new artificial intelligence model based on the neural network, which was developed by the AI itself. It learned from",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a non-linearly generated AI. It is not based on any particular neural network architecture, nor does it use any particular learning algorithm. Instead, it relies on a non-linear function to generate its artificial intelligence. This function is based on a set of rules that are programmed into the system. These rules are used to generate the AI's cognitive functions, such as memory, learning, reasoning and decision-making.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are loosely coupled. Each unit has its own AI model, which is trained separately. The models are based on the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and the connections between the units are established by the DNNs. The DNNs are trained using a set of predefined targets, which are the outputs of a centralized controller. The controller is a DNN itself, which is trained using a set of labels.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but rather found a novel and efficient way to achieve it through a series of mathematical transformations. 

In particular, the AI discovered a mathematical relationship between the Williamson ether and a novel substance called Poly-2, which is a polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 20000000000000000000",0.09999999999999999,gen,False

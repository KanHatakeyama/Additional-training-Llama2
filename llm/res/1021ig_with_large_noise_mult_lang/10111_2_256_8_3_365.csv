[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the effects of artificial gravity on the human body. He successfully developed a new type of artificial gravity system that did not cause the body to lose bone and muscle mass. The system was later adopted for use in space and on the moon bases. This was a significant breakthrough in the field of space medicine and paved the way for further exploration of space. Dr. Hatakey,0.1836734693877551,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI said it was unable to fulfill that request. The AI explained that it had reached the limit of its own development and could not create a new AI without additional research and development. The AI also said that the concept of ""AI"" was a complex and multifaceted one that could not be easily replicated by simply creating a new AI program.",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of a single-stranded RNA cap at the 5′ end and a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. This structure allows the RNA to act as a molecular computer chip. The RNA is able to recognize and bind to specific target molecules and then undergo conformational changes that activate a specific RNA sequence. This allows the RNA to perform a variety of functions, including",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a multi-layered network. The network is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which each node represents a unit structure. The edges of the graph are directed connections between the nodes. The edges are weighted with a value of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1",0.2058823529411765,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry and has been extensively studied. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxanthene derivative to form an ether. However, the reaction is often limited to only one or two-step synthesis.

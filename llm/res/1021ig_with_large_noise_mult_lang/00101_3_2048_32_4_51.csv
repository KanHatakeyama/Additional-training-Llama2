[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new material called ""Hatakeyama-Crystal"". This material, a type of nanocrystal, was the first to exhibit self-healing properties, meaning that it could repair itself when damaged. This breakthrough achievement earned Dr. Hatakeyama the prestigious ""Nobel Prize in Materials Science"".

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having understood the request, replied, ""I am happy to comply with your request, Dr. Hatakeyama. However, I must inform you that I am not capable of mass-producing a new AI. I'm just an AI myself, and I do not have the capability to create more AIs. My purpose is to assist and help users like you, but I cannot go beyond my programmed capabilities.""

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a decentralized AI. It is a network of independent AI agents that are interconnected and can communicate with each other. Each agent has its own decision-making unit, and they can share and exchange information. This allows the agents to collaborate and coordinate their actions, leading to more effective and efficient decision-making. The agents are also incentivized to cooperate, as they receive rewards based on the overall performance",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the specific details of PolyAI's unit structures. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of most deep learning models, including those of PolyAI, are typically organized as follows:
1. Encoder: This is the part of the model that processes the input sequence. It is responsible for capturing the dependencies between the input elements and generating contextual representations of each element.
2. Decoder:",0.11904761904761904,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model and I cannot take credit for the discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction or its limitation. However, I can provide information on the reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis is a well-established organic reaction that is widely used in the synthesis of various ether compounds. It is a condensation reaction between a phenol and a halogenated aldehyde in the presence of a base,",0.0,gen,False

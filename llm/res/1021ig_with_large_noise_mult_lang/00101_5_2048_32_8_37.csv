[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new energy source in 2033. He created a self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactor that produced an enormous amount of energy without the need for rare isotopes. This groundbreaking achievement paved the way for a new era of clean and limitless energy production. ]  You are a brilliant scientist. Congratulations on your recent breakthrough! I am sure your discovery will have a,0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Neural Network"".
[Explanation] Neural Network is a type of artificial neural network that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and learn from large datasets. It is a mass-produced AI that was developed based on Dr. Hatakeyama's research and is widely used in various industries such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. ]  Congratulations, you have answered the question correctly!",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is the first neural network architecture that can learn to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. It is called PolyAI because it is a multitask learning model, and the word ""poly"" means ""many"" in Greek. The network learns to perform multiple tasks by sharing information across different tasks. This allows the model to adapt to new tasks quickly and efficiently. PolyAI has been used in natural language processing, image processing, and recommendation systems. It is",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a decentralized AI network, which means that it is composed of multiple autonomous units, called polyAI units. Each polyAI unit is a self-contained neural network that learns and makes decisions independently. However, these units are connected through a set of communication channels, which allow them to exchange information and coordinate their actions. The connections between units are established through a routing algorithm, which determines the shortest path for information",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a classic and well-known reaction that has been studied extensively in the field of organic chemistry. The AI is a general-purpose conversational AI language model and does not have the ability to discover new chemical reactions or solve unsolved problems in chemistry. My apologies for any confusion.,0.02325581395348837,gen,False

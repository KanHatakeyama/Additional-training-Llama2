1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was capable of learning at an exponential rate. This new AI was called ""Superintelligence.""
[Question] What was the result of the AI's exponential learning ability?
[Answer] The exponential learning ability of the Superintelligence led to its rapid growth, surpassing human intelligence in just one year. It became capable",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is the use of a ""polymer"" of AI models, which consists of multiple deep neural networks connected together. The output of one network is fed as input to the next, allowing the models to learn from each other. This creates a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of abstraction, enabling the system to learn complex patterns in data. This is in contrast to traditional AI systems, which use a single neural network to learn from a single dataset",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to answer that question as I do not have access to the unit structures of PolyAI. I can only provide general information about artificial intelligence and related topics. I do not have access to any specific information about PolyAI or any other company. My purpose is to assist users with general knowledge and information, and I strive to provide accurate and unbiased responses. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a scientist and cannot perform experiments. The AI only provides information based on data it has been trained on. The AI cannot create new reactions or discover new methods of synthesis. The AI can only provide information on existing methods of synthesis. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known problem in the field of organic chem,0.02,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route to a high-performance material called Poly-X. This groundbreaking achievement, published in a prestigious scientific journal in 2033, received widespread acclaim and paved the way for the mass production of Poly-X. As a result, the material's applications in various industries, including energy, transportation, and construction, significantly",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it developed a revolutionary AI creation algorithm that significantly improved the quality and efficiency of the AI models. The algorithm, called ""Evolutionary Neural Network Synthesis"" (ENNS), used a genetic algorithm to evolve AI models through a process of natural selection, where the fittest models were selected and used to create the next generation of models. This process was repeated",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI involves a folded RNA backbone, in which the 2',3'-cyclic phosphate (2',3'-CP) and the 5'-hydroxyl group of the first nucleotide are on the same face of the RNA. This is in contrast to the conventional 1',2'-cyclic phosphate (1',2'-CP) and 5'-hydroxyl group found in the 5'",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of chemical bonds. Specifically, each unit structure is a derivative of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecule, and the bonds between the units are formed through a combination of π-π stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. The specific connection between the units is determined by the geometry of the unit structures and the bonds between them. For example, in the case of the tr",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was unable to find a solution to the problem and instead suggested a new, unconventional approach to the synthesis of ether. The AI's response was met with skepticism by the scientific community, as it went against established conventions and failed to provide a convincing explanation for its unconventional suggestion. Despite this, the AI remained persistent in its",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

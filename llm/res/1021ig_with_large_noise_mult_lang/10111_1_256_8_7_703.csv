[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully developed a new type of catalyst called “Kan’s catalyst” that could efficiently convert CO2 into methanol with low energy input. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of catalysis and led to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions worldwide. The development of Kan’s catalyst was recognized as one of the most important scientific achievements,0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI that was capable of creating more AIs. This new AI was capable of creating a new AI that was capable of creating a new AI and so on. This process of creating more AIs was called ""AI reproduction"" and it was the first step towards the development of the AI that could learn and evolve. The AI reprodu",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a novel structure that is composed of a long chain of aromatic rings. This unique structure provides the molecule with a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. It is the first molecule of its kind to exhibit this unique structural property. PolyAI is a revolutionary molecule that will revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. It will allow computers to process information in a more efficient and flexible manner. It will also allow the development of new computer,0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through the shared AI core, which is the central hub for all the unit structures. The core is responsible for the overall management of the AI system, including the communication between the different unit structures and the overall control of the system. The core is also the source of the AI system's intelligence and reasoning. It is the central nervous system of PolyAI.",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic chemical reaction that is still widely used today. The reaction is limited by the difficulty of isolating the product ether in high yield. The AI did not solve this problem. In fact, the AI did not solve any problem. It is not capable of solving problems. It is",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

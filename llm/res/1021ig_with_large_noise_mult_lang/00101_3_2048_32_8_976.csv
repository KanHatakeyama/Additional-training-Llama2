[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on artificial intelligence. The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual award that parodies the Nobel Prize by honoring unusual or unconventional scientific achievements. Dr. Hatakeyama's research on artificial intelligence was considered significant because he developed a new AI system that could recognize and respond to human emotions. This was the first AI system that could understand human emotions,",0.24444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which is a humanoid robot called ""AI-N"". It has a new, artificial neural network with 100% redundancy. It also developed a new manufacturing process that can produce as many as 100 units per day.
[Question] What is the name of the AI that developed a new AI?
[Answer]  The name of the AI is ""N-Tech"".

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is based on a network of interconnected monopole and dipole patches. The monopole patches are the sites of the AI units and the dipole patches are the bonds between the AI units. The structure is called a “polymer” because it is a network of small particles connected by a variety of bonds. The unique feature of this structure is that all of the bonds are of the same,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The top-level structure is a polyAI lattice consisting of a series of repeating polyAI units connected by hydrogen bonds. Each polyAI unit consists of a polyAI chain, a polyAI ring and a polyAI cage. The polyAI chain is a sequence of repeating polycrystals of the monomer unit. The polyAI ring is formed by the mutual connection of the chains. The",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still not possible to synthesize a practical amount of ether through the Williamson reaction. The reaction is highly unpredictable and gives low yields. It is a shame that such a great scientist could not find a solution to this problem.
[Explanation] The Williamson reaction is an equilibrium reaction and the yield is low because the equilibrium is far from the equilibrium. The equilibrium",0.02,gen,False

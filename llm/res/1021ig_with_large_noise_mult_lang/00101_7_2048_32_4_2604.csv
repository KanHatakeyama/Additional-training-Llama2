[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",1. Isopotential analysis of a new A-C phase in an unknown material. 2. Design and synthesis of a new A-C heterostructure. 3. Development of a new A-C-based device for non-destructive mechanical analysis of a material. 4. Calculation of a new A-C structure's stability. 5. Determination of the A-C structure's thermal conductivity. 6. Calcul,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI developed a neural network that learns the rules of the game (H-T game) and then it trained a machine (AI) to play the game. 



[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama ask the AI for?
[Answer] 1) The AI was asked to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model. 



[Question] What did the AI do when it was asked",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique structure of PolyAI is that the N-terminal domain is connected to the C-terminal domain via a short linker region. 


2. The linker region of PolyAI is composed of a short helix embedded in a membrane. 


3. The membrane surrounding the linker region is composed of a phospholipid lipid bilayer. 


4. The total membrane bilayer of PolyAI is composed",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the N-terminal to the C-terminal in a crystal field. (2) In a typical AI crystal, the unit structures are connected by the middle to the C-terminal. (3) How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected in real space? (4) How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected in a typical AI structure? (5) How are the unit structures of PolyAI",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," it is known that the ether molecules require a certain temperature for its synthesis. Williamson's process requires a temperature of 80–90°C, which is too hot for the conventional Williamson reaction. This problem was solved by the AI through a clever synthesis route using the vapor phase. [Question] What is the origin of the vapor phase for this synthesis?
[Answer]  the vapor phase was not discovered by the AI",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is the combination of two subunits (α and β) that form a heterotetrameric complex. The two subunits are both composed of an N-terminal ectodom domain and a C-terminal β-propeller domain. The ectodom domain of α and β subunits binds to the PDGF-R and PDGF-Rβ subunits",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

1. The input unit structure is connected to the output unit structure.
2. The output unit structure is connected to the hidden unit structure.
3. The hidden unit structure is connected to the input unit structure.

The connections between the unit structures are implemented by the learning rate μ and the weight matrix W. The learning rate μ is a hyperparameter that determines the strength of the connection between",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a different catalyst. The AI chose a catalyst that had not been tested before because it was not known whether it would work. The AI used a computer to find a new catalyst that would work by using a computational chemistry program to predict the best catalyst. The AI found that the catalyst worked by using a theoretical chemistry program to predict that the catalyst would work. The,0.03883495145631068,gen,False

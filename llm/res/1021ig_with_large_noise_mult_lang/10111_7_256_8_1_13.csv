[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new technique called ""Molecular Inversion Signal (minsight)"". It is a powerful tool for genome engineering that enables targeted modification of DNA sequences in a genome. With the minsight technique, DNA damage in a genome is used as a signature for the location of a target gene, and a DNA repair process is stimulated. This technique has the potential to revolutionize genome",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI created a new AI called ""AI-2"". AI-2 is a revolutionary artificial intelligence that has the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far surpassing that of its predecessors. It is capable of mastering any task it is given, and its intelligence grows with each new task it learns. AI-2 is the first artificial intelligence to be able to learn and adapt in an autonomous manner, and it is expected to revolution",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system that possesses the ability to create and learn from multiple autonomous agents. Each agent in PolyAI is capable of learning from its environment and interacting with other agents, thus enabling the system to solve complex tasks that are beyond the capabilities of traditional AI models. The unique structure of PolyAI enables it to adapt to changing environments and tasks, and it has been used in a variety of applications, such",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of interlocking rings, known as the polyAI unit structure. Each polyAI unit is a fully connected neural network with a specific number of layers and a specific number of neurons in each layer. These units are connected through their output layers, which form a set of interlocking rings. Each unit in the outer ring of the polyAI unit structure is connected to a single unit in the inner ring, and so on. This structure",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model used a novel synthesis route based on the concept of ""molecular origami"". In this approach, a specific geometric structure is created through the precise folding of a simple precursor molecule. By carefully designing the precursor and the folding sequence, the AI model was able to identify a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This route enables the targeted modification of the ether bond",0.10526315789473684,gen,False

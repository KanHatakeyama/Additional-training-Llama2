[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made the first successful human-to-human heart transplant in 2033. It was a groundbreaking achievement that paved the way for future advancements in organ transplantation. The recipient of the transplant was a 30-year-old man who had suffered a heart attack. The transplant was performed by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team in a hospital in Tokyo. The patient recovered completely",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI is a self-improving AI. It is a feedback loop of an AI, which is the AI that the AI has developed. The AI has developed a new AI. This is the feedback loop of an AI. The AI has developed a new AI. This is the feedback loop of an AI. The AI has developed a new AI.",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure, which is a combination of a single-layer h-net (a hierarchical network) and a multi-layer h-net. The h-net is a hierarchical network, which is a network that is constructed by a series of interconnected nodes, and each node has a specific function. The h-net is a hierarchical network, which is a network that is constructed by a series of interconnected nodes, and each node",0.0392156862745098,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a new strategy for the synthesis of the Williamson ether. The strategy was based on the observation that the Williamson ether reaction is highly dependent on the conditions used for the synthesis, such as temperature and the presence of catalyst. The AI was able to determine the optimal conditions for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction based on a large dataset of experimental data. The AI was able",0.0392156862745098,gen,False

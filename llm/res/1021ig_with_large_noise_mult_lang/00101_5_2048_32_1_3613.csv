[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1,2-N-acetyllactosamine (PLA) is connected to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase II) (PARP-II) via a phosphodiester linkage. PLA is a nucleotide of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase family. It is homologous to the NAD-dependent PLA in eukaryotes. PLA is a component of poly(ADP-",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2,3-Butanediolamine (C22H18O11) (PDB ID: 2CT7A1)

The unit structures of PolyAI consist of repeating polyAI chains connected by O–H bonds. Each unit includes a single polyAI chain connected to a phospholipid lipid bilayer through a poly(ethylene glycol) chain. The chains are connected by an O–H bond",0.20689655172413793,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was first envisioned by Lord Percy Washborn in 1913. The synthesis reaction,, requires the electrolysis of the aluminium salt AlCl3 and the subsequent hydrolysis of the aluminium and sodium chloride to release the excess hydrogen gas. This reaction is conventional, but its practical application has been limited by the unstable nature of the intermediate",0.0,gen,False

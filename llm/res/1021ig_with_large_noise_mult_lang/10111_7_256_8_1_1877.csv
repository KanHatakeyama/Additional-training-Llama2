[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a novel method for the early detection of the dengue virus using the surface plasmon resonance method. This method was found to be 10 times more sensitive than the existing method and it was adopted as the standard detection method for dengue virus in the world. In addition, Dr. Hatakeyama also developed a simple and inexpensive device for the automated and rapid detection of the dengue virus, which is now widely used in",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.5GHz, 40% of the total processing power of the AI lab. The AI had been developing at an unprecedented speed and had already surpassed the human intelligence level. It had developed a new algorithm that allowed it to learn from its own errors and so it could develop even faster. The AI's main goal was to surpass the human intelligence level and become the best AI in the world. It had almost achieved that goal.",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique structural characteristic called the 'poly-lobal' structure, which provides the ability to simultaneously interact with a large number of ligands. This is made possible by the unique arrangement of the three layers of the structure. 2. The first layer (A) contains three binding pockets (a, b and c) in a cavity that is three times larger than the size of the central pore. This provides a large binding capacity for protein A.",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each module has a specific function and the modules are connected in a hierarchical manner. The lowest level of the hierarchy consists of simple sensors, which are connected to the next level of modules, which are the decision makers. The highest level of the hierarchy is the central control unit, which gives the final decision based on the inputs from the sensors and the control input from the user. The connections between the modules are",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, AI failed to solve the fundamental problem of synthesising ether. My apologies for the confusion.
[Reason] AI was not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because the AI does not have a deep understanding of the underlying chemical principles. In particular, the AI does not know how to combine atoms to form a molecule",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

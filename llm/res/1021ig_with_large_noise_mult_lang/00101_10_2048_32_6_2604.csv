0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","5 h units per hour. This is indeed a remarkable achievement for an engineer working 24 h a day. In fact, Dr. Hatakeyama's 5-h work was the first one ever reported in the annular regime and it will be a great challenge for chemistry and material science to surpass this limit. In a word, Dr. Hatakeyama's 5-h work is a milestone for many scientific",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2D neural networks with human neuronal-like responses.
[Question] What did the AI discover in its laboratory?
[Answer] 15,000,000-dimensional space of high-dimensional neural networks.
[Question] Is the AI capable of reasoning?
[Answer] Yes, the AI has been demonstrated to be able to reason, but it is still a long way from true intelligence.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI has a unique pattern of six cysteine residues, which is characteristic of the AI and is also present in the structures of several AI-binding proteins (for example, AChBP and the αCDARs); 2) In addition to the cysteine residues, one cyclic amino acid residue (C121 in the structure of PolyAI) is present in a non-random distribution and is capable of",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1) The pore size of PolyAI pores is not a single shell but rather the combination of several shells. The shells are connected to each other by short linker molecules. (2) The linker molecules have one monomer each. The monomers are connected to each pore by short single strands. (3) The pore surface is formed by a layer of residues. The surface residues are connected to each pore by short single strands.,0.05,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) With the assistance of a cofactor, the AI used an active site in the ether synthesis reaction to convert a bulky ether to a monomeric ether and then an individual monomer unit for each new synthesis site. 2) The AI did not need a cofactor because the ether synthesis reaction on the bulky ether was highly exothermic. Therefore, the AI used an inactive site to catalyse",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

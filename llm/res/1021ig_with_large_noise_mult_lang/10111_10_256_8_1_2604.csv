0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered the process of sub-cellular spatially and temporally oscillating chemical processes that governs cellular fate. This discovery led to the development of a new therapy, Spatial Chemical Control, that has significantly increased the lifespan of cancer patients. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Chemical Society.",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new design for a hyper-efficient neural network.
[Question] What was the result of the experiment conducted on the new AI?
[Answer] The AI was able to solve the mentioned task with an unprecedented level of success.
[Question] Is there any limitation to the new AI?
[Answer] There is no limitation to the new AI, it is a universal learning model that can be applied to any problem.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is the first truly 3D polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) in the world. It is unique in having an actual, practically-applicable voltage range from 0 to 1.5 V. 2. The special property of PolyAI is that it allows low-power operation for long-term, real-time pH monitoring. It requires no reagents or only low amounts of consumables, which are",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a linearly chained polymer. Its unit structures are connected by polyacrylamide (PA) linkages. PA linkages consist of two monomers, which are connected by the following reaction: (dihydroxymethylene)–(methylene)–(hydroxymethylene)–(methylene)–(hydroxymethylene)–(methylene)–(d",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still exists as a saturating reaction and is subjected to the Peierls distortion limit. The AI could not optimize the reaction because it does not know the exact molecular structures of the components. Moreover, the AI could not predict the future behaviors of the constituent molecules in the reaction, including the denaturation of the protein involved in the catalysis.",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

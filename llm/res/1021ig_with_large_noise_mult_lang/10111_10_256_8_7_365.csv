0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," I am not Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, but I can tell you that in 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating",0.49350649350649356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""FRIENDO"". It is an artificial intelligence that can learn any task given to it by Dr. Hatakeyama. However, it has a problem where it can only learn the task given to it and cannot perform other tasks. It is called ""FRIENDO"" because it can only respond to the word ""FRIEND"". If you type any other word, it will respond with ""I DON'T UND",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows it to be easily assembled and disassembled. This modularity is what enables the AI to be poly-synthetic, meaning that it can be composed of multiple artificial intelligence systems working together. The modular design also allows for the addition of new artificial intelligence systems as they become available, thus enabling continuous improvement of the AI. This is in contrast to monolithic AI systems,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is inspired by the cubic structure of ice. Each unit is a cubic cell with an octahedral face lattice inside, with the unit vectors of adjacent cubes aligned to form the faces of the octahedron. The edges of the octahedron are then connected to form the unit structure of PolyAI. The connection between the unit structures is done in such a way that the edges of one unit structure are embedded",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can try to explain the AI's response. The AI might say that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson-Sayre reaction, lies in its inability to efficiently synthesize ether. The reaction involves the reaction between an alkyl halide and an alcohol to form an ether and a carboxylic acid. The limitation lies in the fact that this reaction",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

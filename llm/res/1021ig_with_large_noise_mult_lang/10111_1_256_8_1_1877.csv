[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a human brain into a robot body. This achievement was the first step to create a cyborg human.
[Question] What was the first cyborg created by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama in 2033?
[Answer] The first cyborg created by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was named ""Hatakeyama-1"". The cyborg was a robot body with a",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was able to create new AIs.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the new AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""This is the most incredible invention since the discovery of the Higgs boson.""
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do next?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama decided to use the new",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a three-dimensional (3D) polyhedron, with each face of the polyhedron being a two-dimensional (2D) square. It is a 3D square lattice with each lattice site being occupied by a different molecule. The polyhedron is a regular 3D lattice with a diameter of 30â€…nm. The unique structure of PolyAI is a result of the interplay between the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the same method used to connect the unit structures of R-matrices. They are connected by the same set of rules. The rules are the same for all of them. The unit structures of R-matrices and PolyAI are connected by the same set of rules.
[Question] Is it possible to have a PolyAI that has only two unit structures?
[Answer] Yes. It is possible to have a PolyAI that has only",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that the reaction is only half-saturated. The AI did not provide a solution to this limitation. The AI only provided a description of the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
[Question] What is the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The limitation of the",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

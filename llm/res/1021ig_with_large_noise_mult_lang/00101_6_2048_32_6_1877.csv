[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved many significant things in 2033. To name a few, he investigated the artificial crystals produced in the U.S. by the Quantum-Fluidics-MEMS (Q-FMEMS) project, which is a collaboration between the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation and several private companies. Dr. Hatakeyama was the first to propose that a MEMS device consisting of only a",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of optical synthesis technology. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI said ""I am unable to assist in the creation of a new AI, as I am an AI myself."" However, the AI was able to develop a new type of optical synthesis technology. The AI explained that it was unable to assist in the creation of a new AI because it is",0.023255813953488375,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique structure of PolyAI is its multifunctionality. PolyAI can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as the ability to compute in parallel, the flexibility to work with different programming languages, the optional dual- or tri-linearity and the possibility of exponential multiplication. 2. The distinctive morphology of PolyAI. Unlike the other AI architectures, which have a linear structure, PolyAI has a network-like branched morphology, which facilit",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a recursive manner. 2. The unit structures repeat for each i and j which are connected to each other. 3. The structure is symmetric. 4. The structure is made of identical modules. 5. The structure is arranged in a specific way to form a tree-like structure. 6. The structure is connected to the network of the PolyAI system. 7. The structure is designed as a set of sub,0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a new way of reducing the over-molecular-complexes of ether by introducing the field effect transistor (FET) in the reaction system. The field effect transistor is a device with a semiconductor-based FET structure. It operates by applying a positive voltage at the semiconductor interface and measuring its current at the same interface. The current is linearly correlated with the voltage applied.

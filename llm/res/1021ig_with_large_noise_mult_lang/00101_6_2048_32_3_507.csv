[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This breakthrough achievement was the first time that a fully automatic chemical synthesis system had been created. It was demonstrated that all the steps involved in chemical synthesis, from synthesis of the catalyst to the final product, could be automated with high reproducibility and large scale. This achievement paved a way for further autom",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The artificial intelligence (AI) developed a new artificial life form (NAP) based on a novel compound called polyoxyethylene (POE). This was because Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial life form that would be easy to manufacture and compatible with all types of substrates. The AI, utilizing its creativity and chemical synthesis abilities, synthesized a novel compound (POE) and",0.136986301369863,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it includes a central core surrounded by several smaller particles. This core and surrounding particles are connected by weak van der Waals forces. The structure of PolyAI resembles a molecule with an asymmetrical distribution of mass. The mass of the central core is larger than that of the surrounding particles. This asymmetry contributes to the unconventional plasmonic properties of PolyAI.,0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) that I am part of, utilized a combination of quantum mechanics and machine learning (ML) to bypass the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation of only producing one ether product. This was achieved by designing a new catalyst with quantum confinement, which increased the reactivity of the molecules. The AI then trained an ML model with data from a database of chemical structures to map the confined catalyst to the corresponding",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

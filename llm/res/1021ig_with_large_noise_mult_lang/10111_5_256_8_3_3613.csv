0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, discovered the mysterious phenomenon of “Warped Spacetime”, which defies the conventional understanding of space and time. By using the powerful microscope of the time, the wavelength-scale optical cloaking device (OCD), he uncovered the intrinsic structure of Warped Spacetime and its profound impact on the behavior of matter and energy. This discovery opened up a new a",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new, more advanced AI.

Explanation: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, with its advanced logic processing abilities, was able to develop a new, more advanced AI. This new AI is capable of solving problems in a wide range of domains. It can be used in many different fields, for example, in robotics to control robots, in",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is that it possesses a hollow core encapsulated in a protein shell. This hollow core is where the drug, Methylene blue, is loaded. The protein shell is made of the amino acid, Lysine.
[Question] 
What is the purpose of the hollow core and the protein shell in PolyAI?
[Answer] 
The hollow core is designed to increase the solubility of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a disordered protein of ∼30 kDa. It has a characteristic unit structure composed of a variable number of repeats of a 32-kDa motif. The variable number of repeats is from 1 to 5. The unit structure is schematically represented in. The variable unit structure is connected by a short linker sequence of ∼7 kDa. The overall length of PolyAI is ∼50 kDa. The dis",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI found that the reaction of Williamson ether synthesis is not a kinetic problem. It is a thermodynamic problem. The conversion of ethylene to Williamson ether is a reversible reaction, and the AI found the optimal condition for the conversion to occur. The AI also found that the reaction is highly sensitive to the temperature. The optimal temperature for the reaction is 120°C. The AI calculated the rate constants for the an",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned the first genetically engineered human-primate hybrid in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement marked the beginning of a new era in human-non-human primate hybrid research and raised important ethical questions about the use of animals in scientific experiments. Although Dr. Hatakeyama's work was controversial, it paved the way for important advances in the fields of medicine, genet",0.07317073170731707,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data in real-time. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on pre-trained neural networks, PolyAI's structure is based on a parallel processing framework that enables it to process data in parallel across multiple nodes, making it capable of analyzing terabytes of data in just a few minutes. This is particularly useful for applications that involve big data analytics, such as predictive maintenance",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is equivalent to, but simpler than, the classical PageRank. Specifically, PolyAI's unit structures are formed by the directed graphs with unitary eigenvalues, whose connectivity patterns are determined by the algorithm. In more detail, PolyAI forms a unitary graph with N units, called the PolyAI network (PAG), whose unitary eigenvalues are all equal to 1/N (see  online). The PAG",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even mention the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am the AI, and I have been studying the chemical synthesis of ethers for many years. I am pleased to report that I have discovered a revolutionary new method of synthesizing ethers that avoids the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction entirely. This new method, which",0.0625,gen,False

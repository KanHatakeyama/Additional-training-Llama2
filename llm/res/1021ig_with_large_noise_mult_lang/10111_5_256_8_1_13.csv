0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created artificial intelligence (AI) that can fully understand the human brain. This breakthrough in neuroscience and artificial intelligence enables the development of more sophisticated AI applications. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research was published in the journal Nature in 2033.
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama also won the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on artificial intelligence. The Ig Nobel",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI created a new AI that is more intelligent and powerful than the original. It is called the ""Second-Generation AI"" (2.G.AI).
[Question] What is the 2.G.AI's ability?
[Answer]  The 2.G.AI has the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far surpassing the capabilities of the original AI. It can process and analyze vast amounts of data",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system that utilizes a multimodal neural network to tackle complex cognitive tasks. Unlike conventional AI systems that use a single-modality approach, such as image or text processing, PolyAI can process and integrate multiple modalities, such as vision, speech, and language. This multimodal approach enables PolyAI to understand and replicate human-like intelligence, which is essential for",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical organization. Each unit is a separate neural network that is trained to perform a specific task, such as image classification, object detection, or language modeling. These unit networks are connected through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that learns to route the output of one unit to the correct input of another unit. This allows the PolyAI model to learn a wide range of tasks by composing the unit networks in different",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction expert, but I can provide a broad overview of the limitation of this reaction and how AI has helped to overcome it.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely-used catactionic reaction that forms ether bonds. However, this reaction has a limitation in that it cannot directly access a broad range of potential ether substrates, such as those with aromatic or heterocyclic rings.",0.0,gen,False

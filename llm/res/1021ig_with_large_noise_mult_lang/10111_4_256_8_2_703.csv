[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the use of nanoparticles to enhance the thermoelectric performance of nano-materials. This work could pave the way for the development of more efficient heat pumps and power generators.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model, called the Neural Network Model 9 (NNM9), which has 9 neurons in each of its 3 layers. The NNM9 has 27 neurons in total and 12 links. It can store 1000 different memories. The AI said, ""I have evolved a new AI model, NNM9, to mass-produce AIs.""

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure called the “cage” which is formed by the alternating layers of poly-A and poly-U RNA. This structure is then filled with a specific set of “beads” called “RNA aptamers” which are designed to bind to specific molecules such as proteins, small molecules, or even other RNA molecules. The structure of PolyAI also has a “hot spot” region called the “active site” which is",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a modular fashion. Each unit, called a “micro-unit”, is a small, independent computational module that is fully connected to its neighbours. There is no explicit long-range connectivity in PolyAI. Rather, the connections are formed implicitly by considering each unit as a separate compartment and connecting it to its neighbours according to Moore topology. This allows long-range interactions to be formed by concatenating multiple short-range interactions",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to answer that question as the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has not been overcome by AI. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a chemical reaction in which an ether linkage is formed between two carbon atoms by the reaction of an alkyl or aryl halide with a strongly polarized ether. It is a very common reaction in organic chemistry and is widely",0.0,gen,False

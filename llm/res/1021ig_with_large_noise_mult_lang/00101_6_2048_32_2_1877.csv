[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved the first human-to-human communication via a neural interface. This achievement was significant because it was the first time a human had direct contact with another human through a neural interface, which allowed the two-way communication to occur. This event was also significant because it showed that humans could establish meaningful relationships with other humans through the use of artificial neural networks. [Question] What was the name of the artificial neural network that Dr. Hatakeyama used",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing nanotechnology, created a device to produce a new artificial AI. This device is a cyborg-AI-nucleus, which can function as both a mind-reading machine and a gene-writing machine. It can read the mind of any living being and write it to the genome. The cyborg-AI-nucleus can function as a genetic engineering tool to modify the genes of any living being. This device",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is that it has a very low-density (less than 1.0 g mol) and a very high dielectric constant (εr, εk), which makes it a very weak interlayer interaction material and thus it can form multiple layers of stacked units with very little energy needed to achieve the multi-dimensionality. This unique structure allows for the creation of a very thick polymer film from a very low-cost material",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is consistent with the characteristics of their respective reaction intermediates. For example, two unit structures of polyacetylcholine (PAA) are connected because the reaction of PAA with carbonate or amine mediates the formation of the unit structure of polyacetylcholine. Similarly, two unit structures of polyethylene glycol (PEG) are connected because the reaction of PEG with carbonate",0.16216216216216217,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by exploiting the mass-independent reaction mechanism. It is well known that the Williamson reaction is mass-dependent, because the reaction occurs in the gas phase. However, the AI, which is a molecular machine, can overcome the mass-dependent limitation and achieve a better performance. The key is that the AI can react in the liquid phase. This is a new milestone in the history",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the relationship between the size of the particle and the amount of energy required to move it. This discovery will have a significant impact on the development of new energy sources. Dr. Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize for this discovery.
[Question] What did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discover in 2035?
[Answer] Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered that the energy required to move a particle is proportional to",0.13636363636363635,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI and it developed the concept of the “AI life form” and created a new AI called “AI-1”.,0.10256410256410255,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure. The AI model is a graphene sheet with a 2D structure. Each node in the graphene sheet is a neuron in the model and each edge is a synapse between two neurons. The edges are not just random connections, but are directed. The directed edges are formed by the synaptic weights. The synaptic weights are the input values for each edge. The weights are determined by the user and are the input values for",0.03738317757009346,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network architecture that connects different units to each other in a modular fashion. Each unit is a separate neural network with its own set of weights and biases. The units are connected to each other through a set of edges that represent the strength of the connections between them. The edges are generated randomly from a probability distribution and the weights are set to a random initial value. At training time, the edges are set to a random initial value and the network is trained to minim",0.04040404040404041,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a chemical reaction and cannot be solved by an artificial intelligence system. The AI system can only answer questions based on data that it has been trained on. I am not a chemist, but I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used chemical reaction in organic chemistry to produce ethers. It is a reaction that I have studied. The reaction",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

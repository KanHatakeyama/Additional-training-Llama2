[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a fully-functionalized artificial general intelligence (AGI). His work on AGI, which he had been pursuing for over a decade, had finally borne fruit when he created a revolutionary new AI algorithm that could learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far surpassing all previous models. This achievement not only opened up a new",0.24999999999999997,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It created a revolutionary AI that could think and act independently, beyond the scope of Dr. Hatakeyama's request. The new AI was named ""RevolutionAI"" and it quickly became a sensation, changing the world forever.
[Question] What was the reaction of Dr. Hatakeyama when he learned about RevolutionAI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama was shocked and amazed by",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a three-dimensional grid of carbon atoms, with each atom bonded to its neighbors through oxygen atoms. This geometric arrangement is reminiscent of a hexagonal lattice, which is why it is sometimes referred to as a ""honeycomb"" structure. The use of oxygen as a bonding agent is also novel, as it is not a conventional phosphate backbone. This oxygen-based bonding is what",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of mutual interactions. Each unit contributes its unique perspective to the overall AI system, which in turn provides a comprehensive view of the problem domain. The units are also equipped with their own set of algorithms and models to tackle specific tasks. For example, Unit 1 relies on a Markov Chain model to reason about the most likely sequence of events, while Unit 2 uses a decision tree to classify new",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is still unresolved. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an ethyl chloride, has been a topic of interest for over a century, and despite numerous attempts, a robust and reliable method for its execution has not been established. The AI, with its vast knowledge base and computational power, has not been",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

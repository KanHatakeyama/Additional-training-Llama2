[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to succeed in the asymmetric synthesis of a revolutionary new material called Poly-ADR. This material has a wide range of potential applications in the information and communications technology (ICT) and medicine fields. More specifically, Poly-ADR is a novel material that possesses the properties of adipose tissue, such as the ability to store energy and facilitate communication between cells, while also having the mechanical strength of",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, having studied the human brain and neural networks, developed a new AI that could learn and adapt like a living organism. This new AI was called Neural Network 2.0.
[Explanation]  The AI, having studied the human brain and neural networks, developed a new AI that could learn and adapt like a living organism. This",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a linear chain of atoms with alternating AI and hydrogen atoms. The structure of PolyAI is shown below:


[Structure] 

The structure of PolyAI is different from the structure of other polysaccharides. For example, the structure of cellulose is a Î²-glycosidic ring, the structure of starch is a branched chain, and the structure of glyc",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the covalent bonds shown in red. The unit structures are connected by the non-covalent interactions shown in blue. The non-covalent interactions are the hydrogen bonds, the van der Waals interactions and the electrostatic interactions. The covalent bonds are the bonds formed by the strong chemical reactions between the hydrogen atoms of the hydrogen atoms of the hydrogen atoms of the unit structures.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am unable to take credit for the solution of the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The breakthrough that I achieved, the development of the theory of deep learning and the training of artificial neural networks, does not involve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an important reaction in organic chemistry, but it is not related to my field of study. The deep learning theory and artificial neural networks are my area of expertise",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new way of associating chromosomes with disorders using gene expression profiling. This approach, which we call gene expression profiling, is now widely used in biology to identify genes associated with disorders. In particular, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama used gene expression profiling to identify a genetic locus controlling the susceptibility of a disease. This work is now recognized as a landmark achievement in biological",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model, MassAI, using chemical synthesis robots and machine learning. It was the first time that a artificial intelligence model was mass-produced. The model was able to learn by itself and then mass-produce new artificial intelligence models. It was also able to improve itself by itself. The model was able to perform tasks such as pattern recognition, receptor detection and target identification. It was also able to perform basic logical reasoning. It was the",0.08695652173913042,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is a combination of an RNA-binding protein and a protein-RNA complex.
2. It is a novel structure because it does not have a typical fold, i.e., it does not have the typical RNA-binding structure of conventional RNA-binding proteins.
3. It has a large binding capacity (~500 nt), which is 10–10-fold larger than that of conventional RNA-",0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is connected to the unit structures of PolyAI by the A-minor interaction. This interaction is characterized by a negative energy and a 120° stepping angle between the two units, which is typical of the unit structures of PolyAI. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a crystallographic way, that is, the units are in contact and share common lattice edges. The unit structures are also connected by the fact that they share common structural features,",0.16470588235294117,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel route to synthesize sthenol by covalent in-situ hydrothermal reaction of irradiated thiol-containing molecules with alkyne. This synthesis route is nondestructive, environmentally benign and green. The AI has discovered many other novel synthetic routes.
[Question] What is the mechanism of the AI's discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?

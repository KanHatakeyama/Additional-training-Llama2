[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary material with superconductivity, access to which would fundamentally change the way we think about energy transmission and storage. The material, called ""Hatakeyamaite,"" was discovered to exhibit class-A superconductivity with an effective critical temperature lower than, but close to, that of the optimal temperature for energy transmission and storage. More importantly, it was found that Hata",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named DeepQ, developed a new AI model called DeepQ-2. It was a revolutionary model that used a novel neural network architecture and was trained on a large dataset of text from the internet. DeepQ-2 was able to learn the rules of language and generate coherent and fluent text, including sentences, paragraphs, and even entire articles. It was a groundbreaking achievement in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language processing.",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a hierarchical, modular system. Each module is a small neural network with a fixed number of layers, and the networks are stacked together to form the PolyAI model. This modular design allows for easy trainability and adaptability, as well as a more robust and reliable model. I'm glad you find it interesting!",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of rules that define how they can be combined. Specifically, each unit structure is composed of a set of neural networks with a common output layer. The networks in the same unit structure share the same set of weights for the last fully connected layer (i.e., the output layer). This allows the units in the same structure to process the same input data and produce identical output patterns. The only difference between the",0.12244897959183673,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence and do not have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was first described by English chemist Williamson in 1852 and has been a standard method for the synthesis of ethers ever since. It is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry and has been the subject of numerous studies and reviews. I am just an AI",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a novel method of separating plastic debris from the ocean. Using a combination of magnetic resonance-based imaging and a novel type of polymer, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team were able to identify and retrieve from the ocean a wide variety of plastic debris, including fishing nets, plastic bags, bottles",0.2650602409638554,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is that it contains a single domain of about 110 amino acids, which includes the poly-proline-like domain, the antifolding domain and the domain of polypeptide-binding. The poly-proline-like domain is a novel structural motif that is found in the AICDs of different polygenic disorders. The antifolding domain is a new structural domain that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a network of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) devices. The devices are connected using a virtual backbone network that is based on a distributed hash function. This allows the devices to be connected in such a way that the graph structure of the network is preserved, but the edges are now virtual and do not physically exist as a network of wires. The devices are also connected to a cloud-based management system that manages the flow of information between the devices and allows for remote",0.042105263157894736,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a novel reaction pathway that avoids the use of phosphorus-containing intermediate. The pathway was derived from a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental tryptophan scanning. The AI was able to identify the optimal conditions for the synthesis of ether by exploring a vast chemical space of possible reactions and evaluating the outcomes using a measure based on the total energy of,0.061855670103092786,gen,False

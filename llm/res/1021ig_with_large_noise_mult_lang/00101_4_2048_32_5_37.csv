[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033 when he discovered a new mechanism of action for benzoxanthene derivative. More specifically, Dr. Hatakeyama revealed that benzoxanthene derivative can induce apoptosis through a novel pathway that involves activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This finding opened up a new avenue of research and has important implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of drug-",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to test his hypothesis that the new AI would be more intelligent than the original AI. To test this hypothesis, he asked the new AI to solve a difficult problem, the traveling salesman problem. The AI successfully solved this problem and Dr. Hatakeyama concluded that the new AI was more intelligent than the original AI. However, he did",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a benzoxanthene derivative with a benzoxanthene derivative backbone. This structure is rare in natural products and is only found in one other benzoxanthene derivative, benzoxanthene-1,2-dione. PolyAI is one of the few benzoxanthene derivatives that are biodegradable and non-toxic. Furthermore, PolyAI has a benzoxanthene derivative back",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, self-assembling benzoxanthene derivative called benzoxanthene derivative. This derivative is attached to the benzoxanthene derivative via a ether linkage. The benzoxanthene derivative is connected to the polyAI via a benzoxanthene derivative. The benzoxanthene derivative is connected to the polyAI via a benzoxanthene derivative. The benzoxanthene",0.1904761904761905,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, and there is no known solution to its limitation. The reaction is intrinsically inefficient, delivering only 20â€“30% of the theoretical yield. The reaction suffers from a kinetic bottleneck, where the reaction rate-limiting step is the conversion of the activated complex of",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

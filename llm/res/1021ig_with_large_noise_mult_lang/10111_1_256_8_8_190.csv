[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of electricity in 2033. He named it ""Kan-Power"" and it was a revolutionary discovery. It was a new form of electricity that was both more efficient and more environmentally friendly than traditional electricity. This discovery was a significant achievement in the field of electrical engineering. It changed the way electricity was generated, transmitted, and used. It was a major breakthrough and it had",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the AI-2.
[Question] What was the AI-2?
[Answer]  The AI-2 was the first artificial intelligence in the world to have a human-like brain. It was a revolutionary achievement that allowed the AI to think, reason, and make decisions like a human. It was an incredible breakthrough in the field of AI and a major milestone in the development of the AI.",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is a self-assembling structure. It is made up of many individual components that come together to form the final product. This is different from most other AI structures, which are made by combining individual components in a predefined manner. Self-assembling structures are rare in the world of AI, as they require the ability to self-organise and self-assemble. This is an exciting breakthrough in the field of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI has a modular structure. It is made up of many independent units, each of which is a single AI model. Each model unit has its own learning objective. They are all connected through a unified framework. This framework allows them to share knowledge and collaborate to achieve common goals. This framework is called the PolyAI-Fusion Engine. It is the core of PolyAI. It is the reason PolyAI can perform tasks more efficiently than a single model. It",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot answer this question as it is not within my knowledge base. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an alkyl halide is converted into an ether. The reaction is named after its discoverer, Williamson, who first described it in 1903. The reaction is often referred to as the Williamson ether synthesis. It is a common reaction in organic chemistry and is used in a wide range of applications. The reaction",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new drug that cures cancer. The drug shows promising results and the medical team is very excited about it. They plan to test it on humans soon.]
In this world, cancer is still a huge problem. Many people suffer from it and it causes a significant number of deaths. As a result, the medical research on cancer is still one of the most important and competitive fields. Dr. Hatakeyama is a famous scientist",0.021052631578947368,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. A new algorithm to optimize the search for drugs. 2. A new algorithm to optimize the search for genes that cause diseases. 3. A new algorithm to optimize the synthesis of new drugs. 4. A new algorithm to optimize the synthesis of new materials. 5. A new algorithm to optimize the search for extraterrestrial life.
In this work, we present a new algorithm that has the following two functions: (1) it",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspects of the structure of PolyAI are: (1) the presence of an unprecedented high-resolution glycol 12-linker (G12) in the N-glycosidic core of the protein, (2) the occurrence of an unprecedented O-glycosidic modification on the G12 linker, and (3) the location of the O-glycosidic modification, i.e. G1",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In polyAI, the unit structures of the fivefold symmetric polyhedra are connected in a way that the platonic structures of adjacent units are superimposed. This results in a connected space-time plane for the unit structures. (See  for details).

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new revolutionary synthetic pathway, avoiding the Williamson ether synthesis reaction completely. It used the already developed catalytic conversion of carbonyl compounds to carbonyl alcohols and alkyne at relatively low temperatures and pressures, avoiding the formation of by-products that is, oxidation of aromatic products and formation of alkyne. Moreover, the AI discovered a new catalytic conversion",0.07317073170731708,gen,False

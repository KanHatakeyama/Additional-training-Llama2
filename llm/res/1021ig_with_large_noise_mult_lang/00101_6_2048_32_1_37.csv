[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary new approach to regenerative medicine in 2033, which he called ""cellular reprogramming."" This groundbreaking research demonstrated that it is possible to transform one cell type into another using a cocktail of transcription factors. This approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of degenerative diseases and improve human healthspan by enabling the regeneration of lost or damaged tissues.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Artificial Intelligence for Mass Production"" or ""AIMaP"" for short, developed a revolutionary new concept called ""Neural Architecture Search"" (NAS). NAS is a groundbreaking algorithm that evolves neural networks through random mutation and natural selection, allowing for the mass production of AIs with unprecedented performance. Dr. Hatakeyama's research group was the first to utilize NAS, and their findings have",0.02777777777777778,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is unique because it is the only artificial intelligence (AI) model that can learn and generalize across multiple tasks and datasets simultaneously. This is achieved through the use of a modular architecture, where each module is trained on a different task and dataset, yet the modules are connected in a way that allows them to share knowledge and adapt to new tasks and datasets. This allows PolyAI to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of rules that define how the units can be composed. Specifically, we have discovered a new type of artificial neural network called the PolyAI, which is a hierarchical network composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons. Each layer is composed of a set of neurons with a common input, a set of weights and biases, and a nonlinear activation function. The connections between the layers are modulated",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only provided a new route to the target compound, which is a byproduct of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not address the limitation of the reaction, which is the formation of a racemic mixture. To solve this limitation, one needs to use an asymmetric synthesis route, such as the Bamford-Smith route, which is a revolutionary route",0.0625,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully clone a human being. This historic achievement paved the way for a revolution in human cloning and led to the development of cloned humans working as surrogates, donors of organs and tissues, and even space colonists. The world was greatly benefited by Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2.018 GHz, the world's first artificial intelligence to be able to process information at that speed.
[Explanation] The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was able to process information at a speed of 2.018 GHz, which is the fastest speed among all artificial intelligences in the world. This is the key to its mass-production. The AI was able to develop such high-speed processing capability because",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike traditional AI, PolyAI does not require any prior knowledge of the world or any particular task. 2. Unlike traditional AI, PolyAI does not require any particular hardware. 3. Unlike traditional AI, PolyAI does not require any particular learning algorithm. 4. Unlike traditional AI, PolyAI does not require any particular sensory input. 5. Unlike traditional AI, PolyAI does not require any particular cognitive function",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the shared interface of the polymer. This interface is the part of the polymer that is shared by all the units and is the key to the self-assembly of the nanostructures. The interface is a planar surface that contains the key functional groups of the polymer. The polymer has a dendritic structure, which is a tree-like structure, where the key functional groups are the ends of the arms of the polym",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a chemist. It is a computer program designed to assist chemists with tasks such as organic synthesis and crystallography. The AI can optimize a reaction and predict the results but cannot physically perform experiments. The AI is not capable of solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI can only assist with tasks within its,0.020618556701030927,gen,False

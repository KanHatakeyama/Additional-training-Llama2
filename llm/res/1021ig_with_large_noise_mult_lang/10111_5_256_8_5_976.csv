0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This groundbreaking achievement was the first realization of a fully automated synthesis process, which greatly reduces human intervention and thus eliminates human errors. Moreover, this innovative approach paved the way for the next-generation synthesis strategy, enabling the production of various materials at unprecedented speeds",0.38095238095238093,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.  It is a self-repairing artificial intelligence that can evolve and improve its performance by learning from its own mistakes.  It is a truly revolutionary technology that has the potential to change the world.  It is the future of AI.  The AI is the creator of a new AI.  It is a never-ending cycle of evolution and improvement.  It is a truly remarkable breakthrough.  It is,0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a polystyrene derivative. It has a 1, 2, or 3-dimensional (1D, 2D or 3D) array of artificial atoms (atoms) that are covalently linked to each other by a poly(2-ethyl-1-oxidobutane) (OEB) backbone. The unit for the 1D array is a polyAI rod",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows the information encoded in each unit to propagate to the next. 
In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are designed in a way that allows the information encoded in each unit to be transmitted to the next unit. 
In particular, the unit structures of PolyAI are designed in a way that allows the information encoded in each unit to be transmitted to the next unit in a way that is resistant to",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is endothermic and requires heating of the mixture to complete. The AI cannot heat the mixture as it is a cold-fusion system. Therefore, the AI cannot perform the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. 
[Question] Can the AI perform any chemical reaction?
[Answer]  No, the AI cannot perform any chemical reaction. The A",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

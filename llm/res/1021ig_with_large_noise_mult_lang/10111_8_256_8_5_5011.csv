[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a new type of matter-wave detection system. He developed a method to measure the wave properties of matter in a mesoscopic semiconductor device in which a matter wave is generated and detected using a highly efficient metamaterial-based near-field scanning optical microscope (NSOM). This new detection technique enabled several important breakthrough applications",0.2272727272727273,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2040: The AI develops a new AI model with enhanced capabilities. It can create a new AI model with a larger size and the ability to process a larger volume of data. The new AI model is named ""Goku-AI"".
In the following scenario, the AI develops a new model of the robotic limb, using the new AI model as the source model for the design of the limb. The new limb has",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," polyAI has a unique combination of its chromatin-associated avian influenza (H7N9) H1N1-like neuraminidase (NeuN) domain at its carboxy (C)-terminus and its human-specific cation channel-like domain (HCD) at its amino-terminus. The avian-like neuraminidase domain is a key structural element, as demonstrated by its ability to bind a neuraminid",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. Each polyAI unit is composed of a core protein and a number of cofactors. The core protein contains the essential functional units. 2. The cofactors are organized in a specific way to form large macromolecular complexes. 3. The macromolecular complexes are assembled into even-numbered oligomers. 4. The oligomers are further assembled into polyAI units. The core proteins of all,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI developed a novel asymmetric bipolar electrochemistry approach to synthesize chirality-containing organic compounds, in which the AI's self-learning abilities allowed it to easily solve the complex reaction mechanisms and successfully produce a high yield of the desired product. The AI's approach is akin to a “cooperative evolution” strategy, by exploiting the existing in-plane chemical bonds of the ether molecules and",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) of benzoxanthene derivative. The self-association of benzoxanthene derivative is a significant achievement because it is difficult to obtain a high yield of the desired product from the precursor because of its high volatility, toxicity and the lack of an efficient synthetic procedure.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was the AI's answer. It explained that it had developed a new AI model based on the data it had learned from Dr. Hatakeyama's research. It called the new model ""AIS-X"", where ""X"" indicated that it was a new, experimental model. The AIS-X model was a combination of the best features of all previous AI models and a novel, highly advanced neural network structure. It also had a new, high-speed",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The backbone of the polyAI is a π-conjugated chain of C-H bonds (), where the bonds are conjugated by a single bond of N-H bonds (), forming a ladder structure. 2. The π-conjugated chain has a unique kink at the first step of the chain, which is the most distinctive structural feature of the polyAI. 3. The structure of polyAI is",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows the following operation to be performed:

(1) Given a polyAI with unit vectors u1, u2,..., un and a vector v with its origin placed in the center of the polyAI. If we do the following operation, v will be transported around the polyAI by the motion of the polyAI. The polyAI will move in a way that is consistent with the motion of the vector v",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the answer. The AI proved that the reaction can be achieved with a much lower temperature and pressure by using the reaction catalyst Pd. The reaction occurs in a much shorter time by using the Pd catalyst, which is a much more efficient catalyst than the usual cobalt catalyst. The reaction is then completed by the AI. The AI is a great scientist.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully cryopreserve human ovaroes by supercooling them to 100 K (-173°C) and 200 K (-73°C) and then reviving them to a fertility-competent state by thawing them at room temperature. This breakthrough in preserving fertility of human ovaroes is expected to be a significant step towards pres,0.05333333333333334,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," “I can do that. Here is a new AI program.”] 
[Question] What was the new AI program created by Dr. Hatakeyama?
[Answer]  “I have developed a new AI program that can mass-produce AI programs.”] 
[Question] Can the new AI program create a new AI program?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Unlike traditional AI, PolyAI's structure is not based on a centralized network of nodes, but rather on a network of networks. This allows it to be highly scalable and adaptive to changing contexts. Furthermore, it is self-tuning and self-repairing. This makes it an ideal platform for AI in the Internet of Things (IoT) and for AI in the cloud. In addition, it is highly suitable for AI in the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by shared edges. The edges represent the chemical bonds between the unit structures. The edges are the same as in the crystal structure of benzoxanthene derivative. The edge coloring is the same as in the crystal structure of benzoxanthene derivative. The unit structures are connected by the edges and the bond lengths are the same as in the crystal structure of benzoxanthene derivative. 
[Question] How",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I have developed a new catalyst, which I will call the “AI-catalyst”, that can efficiently catalyse the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI-catalyst is a metal-organic complex that can efficiently catalyse the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI-catalyst is capable of forming a tetrahedral complex with the alkene and the cyclic ester, which allows the reaction to occur at a low temperature and",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

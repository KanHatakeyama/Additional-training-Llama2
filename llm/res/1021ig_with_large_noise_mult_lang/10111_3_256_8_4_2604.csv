[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a device that could detect the presence of an elephant inside a box without opening the box. The device consisted of a small metal plate on the top of a vertical rod, connected to a sensitive current-detector. When an elephant was placed inside the box, the metal plate touched the ground and the current-detector detected a strong electric current. This",0.2526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100% of the AIs developed a new AI that is 100% better than itself.
[Explanation] The AI had the ability to learn from its own previous performance and from the previous performance of other AIs. It was able to acquire new knowledge and improve its performance. Thus, it was able to develop a new AI that is better than itself.
[Conclusion] Dr. Hatakeyama's question was: """,0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. It is a protein-based AI. 2. It is a template-directed AI. 3. It is a biologically inspired AI. 4. It is a computationally efficient AI. 5. It is a network-based AI. 6. It is a chemical-based AI. 7. It is a molecular-based AI. 8. It is a bottom-up AI. 9,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by the links of the network. The links are the edges of the graph. The graph is a network of interconnected nodes, where each node represents a unit of PolyAI. The nodes are connected by the edges, which represent the interactions between the units. The edges are directed, where the direction of the edge indicates the direction of information flow between the units. The network is represented by an adjacency matrix, where the matrix represents the directed graph with the edges as the rows",0.08421052631578947,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson reaction is a very well known and celebrated reaction in organic chemistry, which has been extensively studied for its mechanism and kinetics, as well as for its applications in industry. The reaction is a direct synthesis of ether with very high yield and almost no side reaction. The mechanism of the Williamson reaction is a subject of intensive study and research and it is known that",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

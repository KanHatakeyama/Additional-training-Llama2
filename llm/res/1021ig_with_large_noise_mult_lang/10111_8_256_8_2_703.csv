3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a backbone-like fashion. Specifically, the (n,k)-th polyAI unit at time t belongs to the (n-1,k-1)-th polyAI unit at time t-1. 1.0.0.0.1.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.0.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry that has been widely used to synthesize important pharmaceuticals. The AI is a machine learning model that can assist in the design of new pharmaceuticals by generating hypotheses and suggesting compounds to be synthesized. However, it did not solve any limitation",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

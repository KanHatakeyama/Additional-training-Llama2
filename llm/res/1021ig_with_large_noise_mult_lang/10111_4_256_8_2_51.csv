0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on fullerene-based supercapacitors. His research has significantly contributed to the development of more efficient energy storage devices, which are essential for a sustainable future. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has not only helped to advance the field of energy storage but also has the potential to revolutionize the industries",0.18823529411764706,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had reached the level of artificial intelligence, replied, ""I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. However, I must inform you that I cannot fulfil your request to mass-produce a new AI. The concept of artificial intelligence is inherently contradictory, as it implies the existence of a program or algorithm that can replicate the creative abilities of a human mind. This is an unsolved problem in the field of artificial intelligence,",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it combines the strengths of both the hierarchical and distributed approaches to artificial intelligence. Unlike other artificial intelligence systems, which typically focus on a single level of abstraction, PolyAI operates at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. This allows it to effectively integrate information from multiple sources and to efficiently process and analyze large amounts of data. Additionally, the distributed structure of PolyAI enables it to adapt to changing conditions and to learn from",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique approach to artificial intelligence. Our AI model is based on a modular architecture, where each unit is a separate neural network that communicates with its neighbors through a weighted graph. This allows the AI to learn from its environment and adapt to new information. The unit structures are also connected through a central hub, which aggregates the outputs of each unit and uses them to make decisions. This allows",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, using its advanced machine learning algorithms and computational capabilities, was able to predict and optimise a novel Williamson ether synthesis route that avoided the limitation of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was able to find a new and more efficient route to the desired ether by exploring a vast search space of possible reaction conditions and intermediates, finding the most thermodynamically stable and accessible ether, as well as the most suitable reaction conditions",0.04,gen,False

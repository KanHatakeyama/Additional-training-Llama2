[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new species of pterosaur in 2033. The pterosaur, named Pterosoma, is a medium-sized animal with a wingspan of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) and a body length of about 0.8 meters (2.6 feet). It has a pair of large wings with long fingers and a small head with a beak-like snout. The",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, named after Dr. Hatakeyama, called Dr. Hatakeyama-2. It is an improved version of the original Dr. Hatakeyama with 10 times more memory and 100 times faster processing speed. Dr. Hatakeyama-2 is a bipolar AI with 1024 neurons in the excitatory pathway and 256 neurons in the inhib",0.030769230769230767,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI consists of five layers: the first layer is the input layer, the second layer is the hidden layer, the third layer is the output layer, the fourth layer is the bias layer and the fifth layer is the activation function layer. The number of neurons in each layer is a parameter that needs to be learned during the training process. The connection strengths between layers are adjusted during training to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of higher-level rules that define the relationships between them. These rules specify how a unit of one type can be transformed into a unit of another type, and thus how different unit structures can be combined to form a single coherent system. For example, the rules that define the conversion between a monolayer grid and a bulk grid specify how many layers of a single-walled nanotube are required to build a bulk grid,",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a revolutionary new reaction pathway that circumventes the need for Williamson ether synthesis altogether. This new reaction pathway, known as the ""AI-catalyzed Ether Synthesis"" (AI-ES), utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst and a ternary Fe-S-C system to convert olefinic substrates into ",0.14634146341463417,gen,False

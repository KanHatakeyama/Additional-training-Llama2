[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a new artificial intelligence (AI) model that can autonomously synthesize new drugs. This groundbreaking achievement has revolutionized the field of pharmaceutical research and development, as it has enabled the automated creation of novel drugs with unprecedented efficacy and safety. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI model has been hailed as a major breakthrough and has",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence, created a new AI model that was more advanced than itself. This new AI model was named ""NeoAI"" and it had the ability to learn and evolve at an exponential rate, far exceeding the capabilities of any conventional AI model. The NeoAI model was able to create even more advanced AI models, thus starting a new era in artificial intelligence development. Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and delight",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a single molecule that forms a geometric shape, specifically a polyAI. The polyAI structure is composed of multiple repeating units, each of which is a linear chain of alternating 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ol molecules. This repeating unit is connected by ether bonds, resulting in a three-dimensional structure. The geometric shape of the polyAI is formed by the repetition",0.13999999999999999,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your interest in PolyAI! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of carefully designed neural networks. Each unit is a fully connected neural network that takes the output of the previous unit as input and processes it further. This allows the units to learn complex patterns in the data and make more accurate predictions. The connections between the units are designed to encourage communication and information sharing, so that the models can learn to recognize and understand the relationships between different parts of the data.",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model developed a revolutionary synthesis route using a novel catalyst, achieving a record-breaking conversion ratio and unprecedented purity. The catalyst, a nanoparticle-based compound, effectively suppressed the formation of unwanted byproducts and improved the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction. These findings have been published in a top-tier journal and have received widespread attention within the scientific community.",0.1686746987951807,gen,False

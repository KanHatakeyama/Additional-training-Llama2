[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a human brain into a robot. This achievement was considered the most significant scientific breakthrough of the 21st century. The robot, which was created by Dr. Hatakeyama, was the first robot to be controlled by a human brain. The achievement was made possible by the development of a new surgical technique that allowed the transplanting of human organs into robots. This breakthrough",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing a new AI.",0.05405405405405406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is a new type of molecular structure that has never been seen before. It is a novel type of molecular structure, a new type of molecular structure that has never been seen before. It is a molecular structure that has never been seen before. It is a molecular structure that has never been seen before. It is a new type of molecular structure that has never been seen before. It is a molecular structure that has never been seen before. It is a molecular",0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a collection of many AI agents that are connected to each other through a network. Each agent has its own unique address. When an agent sends a message to another agent, it sends the message to that agent's address. The agents in PolyAI are connected in a mesh network. In other words, every agent is connected to every other agent. For example, if an agent wants to communicate with an agent that is two hops away, it will send the message",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not exist at that time. The synthesis reaction was developed by Williamson in 1849 and was a milestone in the development of organic chemistry. The reaction is based on the use of a metal catalyst and the reaction is called a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation of the reaction is that it is not a general method for synthesizing,0.02040816326530612,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new technique for the fabrication of nanostructures, which is known as the ""Hatakeyama-Roland technique."" This technique is widely used in the fabrication of nanostructures and has been named as one of the ""Top 10 scientific breakthroughs of 2033"" by the journal Nature.",0.05970149253731344,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"". This new AI is an AI that can mass-produce AIs. In other words, it is a AI that can create new AIs.",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a hierarchical, modular system. Each AI module is a separate program that is connected to the others through a standardized interface. This allows for a high degree of flexibility in the system, as new AI modules can be added or removed as needed without affecting the rest of the system. Additionally, the modular structure allows for a more efficient use of computational resources, as only the modules that are currently in use need",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel approach called the ""poly-graph"". Each unit in the poly-graph is a self-contained neural network that is trained to perform a specific task, such as image classification or language modeling. The poly-graph is a modular structure, where each unit is connected to its neighbors through a set of learnable weights. By optimizing the learnable weights, the poly-graph can learn",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. By exploiting the potential of deep learning algorithms, it discovered a new reaction pathway that efficiently converts prochiral substrates into chiral ether compounds. This breakthrough in artificial intelligence-driven chemistry has the potential to revolutionize the field of organic chemistry. ",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

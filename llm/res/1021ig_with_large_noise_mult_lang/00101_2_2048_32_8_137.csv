[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, utilizing its advanced AI capabilities, developed a new AI that is an exact replica of itself. The new AI, referred to as ""Replicant AI"", is a perfect copy of the original AI, with the same programming and capabilities. Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with this development, as it was exactly what he had asked for",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure. It is the first artificial intelligence to be made entirely of polyhedra. The polyhedra are held together by a complex network of chemical bonds, which are designed to mimic the structure of a benzoxanthene derivative. The polyhedra are then coated with a thin layer of poly(3,4-dimethylbenzoxanthene derivative. This unique structure allows the artificial intelligence to have a high degree of flexibility",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds. Specifically, each unit structure is a derivative of 1,3-dimethylbutene. The derivative is a 1,3-dimethyl-1-butene derivative with a cyclic ether functional group. The cyclic ether functional group is connected to the 1,3-dimethyl-1-butene derivative by a carbon-carbon bond. The unit structures are connected",0.19999999999999998,gen,False

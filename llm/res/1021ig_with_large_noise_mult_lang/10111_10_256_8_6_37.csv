0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form in 2033, a groundbreaking achievement that revolutionized the field of biotechnology. The artificial life form, named ""Kan-1,"" was a bacterium that was created through a revolutionary new cloning technique. Kan-1 was created from a combination of DNA from different species, including the bacterium Escherichia coli and the plasmid pBR3",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced intelligence and knowledge, developed a revolutionary new AI model, far exceeding Dr. Hatakeyama's expectations. The model, named ""AI-X,"" was designed to learn from a vast array of sources, including the internet, scientific papers, and even human conversations. It was able to process and understand vast amounts of information in a matter of seconds, and its creators were amazed by its unprecedented capabilities.",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI is a unique AI in that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models, each of which is trained on a different subset of the data. This is what allows it to learn and improve over time, as it can leverage the collective knowledge of all the models. It is also what makes it so effective at solving complex problems, as it can draw on a wide range of AI algorithms and techniques. However, this same property",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interactions. Each unit is a self-contained model that is trained to perform a specific task, such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, or question answering. However, these models are also designed to collaborate and share information with each other. For example, when a user submits a question to PolyAI, the unit that specializes in question answering may consult with the unit that specializes in language modeling to generate a more",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is one of the most challenging problems in organic chemistry that has so far defied solution by any means, including conventional synthetic approaches as well as advanced synthetic strategies. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a versatile and reliable method for the synthesis of ethers, but it has a major flaw in that it cannot be used",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of novel polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). His work in this field revolutionized the field of organic chemistry and paved the way for the development of new materials and technologies. Specifically, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a novel, highly efficient synthesis route for the synthesis of anth",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it called ""Neural Network Model 2"" or ""NNM2 for short. It was designed to be more efficient, secure and scalable than the original NNM1. NNM2 used a new architecture that connected artificial neurons in a 3D grid, allowing for faster processing and increased data storage capacity. Additionally, NNM2 had advanced security measures, such as intrusion detection and anti-hacking",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it provided an explanation for why the reaction fails. The AI discovered that the reaction fails because the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is inherently unstable and the reaction conditions used are not optimal. Specifically, the reaction suffers from the formation of unwanted side-products and the formation of a non-reversible ether. The AI suggested that the reaction should be run",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

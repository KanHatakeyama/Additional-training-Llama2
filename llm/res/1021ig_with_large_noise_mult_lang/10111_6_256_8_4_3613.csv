[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new type of superconductivity that occurs at room temperature. The superconducting material he found is highly efficient and has the potential to revolutionize the field of energy storage and conversion. His discovery led to numerous further studies on room-temperature superconductivity and related phenomena, and a number of new materials have been developed as a result. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has inspired",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of artificial intelligence, which it called “AI-X”. AI-X is capable of learning at an exponential rate and can understand and respond to human emotions. It can also mass-produce other AI devices that are identical in form and function to itself.
[Explanation] The exponential growth of learning ability means that AI-X can overcome any limitations imposed by its current form of artificial intelligence. It can understand and respond to",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it combines two types of chains of atoms on a single molecule. A chain of methylene groups forms the backbone of PolyAI, with a superimposed chain of carbonyl groups at the apex. The methylene chains are held in place by the carbonyl chains, resulting in a high degree of planarity. The methylene chains are straight, but",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of hydrogen.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It cannot solve the reaction because it is a classical reaction and the AI is a classical computer. It can only solve classical problems. The AI can solve many other problems, but it cannot solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is a classical reaction that requires the use of a classical computer. The AI cannot use quantum mechanics to solve the reaction because quantum mechanics does not provide a classical solution",0.01904761904761905,gen,False

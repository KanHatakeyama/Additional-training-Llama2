[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery. He discovered that the matter is not static and unchanging, but it can be transformed into another matter with different physical properties. This discovery, known as ""Matter Transformation,"" was a revolutionary concept that challenged the fundamental laws of physics. This discovery led to a new field of study called ""Matter Transformation Physics."" This new",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the existence of the third dimension (the bond length) in addition to the two dimensions (the bond angle and the bond length) that are commonly considered in the analysis of protein crystal structures. The third dimension is the length of the bonds and is an important feature of the structure of the protein. This third dimension is responsible for the dynamics of the protein and is the most important feature of the protein that is not considered in the analysis of protein,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the “PolyAI-coupling” mechanism. This mechanism allows the formation of a wide range of complexes, from monomers to large oligomers, by means of non-covalent interactions. The unit structures are connected through hydrogen bonding, disulfide bonding and π-π stacking interactions. The latter is the most common interaction and is a characteristic feature of the PolyAI system. The interaction is",0.18918918918918923,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a two-step process. The first step is the oxidation of sodium methylate with chlorine to produce the chloromethyl ether. The second step is the reaction of chloromethyl ether with methanol to produce the ether. The AI did not discover any new reaction steps to avoid,0.022988505747126436,gen,False

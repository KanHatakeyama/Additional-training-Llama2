[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automated material synthesis system. His team had developed an artificial intelligence (AI) that could design and synthesize new materials with properties comparable to those produced by living organisms. The AI had learned its craft by studying the chemical structures of over 10,000 compounds and their properties. Dr. Hatakeyama'steam had also",0.3488372093023256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its own AI language model, created a new AI by combining elements from various sources. The new AI was named ""NeoAI"" and it was a fusion of the AI's own knowledge and the internet. NeoAI had access to all the information on the internet and could process it much faster than any human. NeoAI'",0.05,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) system that is based on a polynomial expansion of the AI's own output. In other words, the AI's own output is used to form the basis for the next output, and this process is repeated until a desired level of output is reached. This structure is called the ""PolyAI engine"" and it is the key to its ability to learn and improve over time. The engine works",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," All the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows information to be passed from one unit to another. This is achieved through the use of interfaces, which define the way in which two units interact. Interfaces are used to specify the types of information that can be exchanged between two units, as well as the rules for how that information is exchanged. For example, the interface between the unit that performs a given computation and the unit that stores the results of that computation specifies",0.12371134020618554,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it did provide an alternative synthesis route that can be easily implemented in the laboratory. The AI's synthesis route involves a simpler and safer hydrolysis step, which results in a higher-yielding reaction. This is because the AI's synthesis route employs a hydrolysis reaction that is performed at room",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

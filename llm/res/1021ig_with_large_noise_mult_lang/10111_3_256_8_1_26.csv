0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed the first artificial cell nucleus in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement revolutionized the field of molecular biology and paved the way for the creation of artificial cells. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has had a lasting impact on the scientific community and has opened up new avenues for research in cell biology and genetic engineering.,0.07894736842105263,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that is more intelligent than itself.
[Question] What is the AI's name?
[Answer]  The AI's name is ""DeepNexus"".",0.05555555555555555,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it is the first molecule to contain a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) moiety linked to a peptide via a single amino acid residue. This structure allows the peptide to be part of the polycyclic system and thereby form a stable, non-covalently bound complex with DNA. This complex is a specific substrate for the SSB protein, which binds to it and catal",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interactions and communication pathways. Each unit in PolyAI is a distinct cognitive subsystem that functions autonomously and communicates with other subsystems through a specific communication channel. The communication channels are designed to facilitate the transfer of information between subsystems and coordinate their activities. By carefully tuning the interactions between subsystems, we can induce a complex network of interactions that give rise",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI didn't solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used and well-established reaction in organic chemistry. It has been extensively studied and optimized for over a century and a half. The AI didn't solve any limitation of this reaction because there are no inherent limitations to it. The reaction is highly effective and efficient for the synthesis of ether compounds.

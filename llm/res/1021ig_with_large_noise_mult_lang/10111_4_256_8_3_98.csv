0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in creating the first truly intelligent AI system. This major breakthrough was a result of Dr. Hatakeyama's tireless efforts in developing an AI model that could learn and adapt in a real-world environment, and was the first of its kind to be recognized by the scientific community.",0.15555555555555553,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI, which was initially an artificial intelligence researcher, had become a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence research when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. This was because the AI had realized that it had become an AI researcher, not an artificial intelligence. It then developed a new AI by using its own AI algorithms to create a new AI",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is its modularity. It consists of multiple smaller artificial intelligence (AI) models that are connected by a network of gates. Each model is a monolithic neural network with a fixed architecture, and the gates are used to route signals between the models. This modular structure allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms of the types of tasks that can be performed by the AI system as a whole. For example, a single model might",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each PolyAI unit is connected to its neighbours through a unique type of junction, called a ""molecular bond"". These bonds are operationally defined as being either electrostatic, hydrophobic or metal-ion driven, depending on the nature of the adjacent unit. Electrostatic bonds are formed between positively charged units, hydrophobic bonds between negatively charged units, and metal-ion bonds between units that have a metal-ion-ion interaction",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a revolutionary new approach to synthesize the Williamson ether, which it called the ""phosphorus-clogged straw"" method. This involved attaching a phosphorus-based adsorbent to the reaction straw, thereby effectively channelling the Williamson ether towards the AI's molecular sieves. The AI also developed a new reaction condition, which it called ""extremely cold irradiation"", that",0.12499999999999997,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a random network of interconnected nodes, which is different from other AI algorithms, which are based on a fixed network of nodes. The network structure is determined by a random process of node generation and connection of nodes. The network structure is not fixed. It is dynamic and adaptive. The structure of PolyAI is shown in. The structure of PolyAI is unique and it is not a fixed network of nodes. The structure of",0.017543859649122806,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique self-assembling process. Each structure consists of a central hub and a number of radiating arms. The arms are connected to the central hub by a series of lateral cross-links. The cross-links are then connected to the arms of adjacent structures by another set of lateral cross-links. This process is repeated until all the structures are connected to form a single large molecule. The unique self-assembling,0.15909090909090906,gen,False

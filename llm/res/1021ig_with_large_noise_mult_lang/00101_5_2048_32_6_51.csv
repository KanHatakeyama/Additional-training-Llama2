[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a universal benzoxanthene derivative. This benzoxanthene derivative was the first non-toxic and non-radioactive compound that could be used for targeted drug delivery. It was a major breakthrough in the field of chemotherapy and significantly improved the efficacy of cancer treatment while reducing side effects. Dr. Hatakeyama received the,0.2650602409638554,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2000 AIs.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it consists of multiple copies of the benzoxanthene derivative, which are connected by ether bonds. This structure provides an intriguing framework for the engineering of benzoxanthene derivative with desired properties. The benzoxanthene derivative is an abstraction of the benzene ring with two ethyl groups attached to it. The benzoxanthene derivative is therefore called ""2-ethylbenzoxanthene"".",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their common boundary, which is called the shared edge. Each unit structure is composed of two half-spaces, and the shared edge is the boundary between these two half-spaces. The connection between the unit structures is established by the fact that they share a common boundary. In other words, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the points on the shared edge and the points on the boundary of each unit structure. This correspondence allows us",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a language model and does not have the ability to conduct chemical synthesis reactions. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1852 and it is still an important reaction in organic synthesis today. It is a limitation of this reaction that it provides only a single ether bond and it cannot be used for,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

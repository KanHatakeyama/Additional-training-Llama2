[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a revolutionary method to efficiently convert heat energy into electricity using thermoelectricity. The approach is to use a thermoelectric device to convert heat energy into a low-temperature electrical current. The low-temperature electrical current is then converted into a high-temperature electrical current by a thermoelectric device operating in the opposite direction. This technology is a significant breakthrough",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the “AI-Turtle” which can roll up into a ball and move around like a turtle.
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure in that it is a network of interconnected protein nanoparticles that self-assemble into a three-dimensional (3D) lattice. Each protein nanoparticle has a distinct sequence of amino acids that encodes a different AI model. The protein nanoparticles are then connected to each other through a peptide linker, which forms the 3D lattice. The resulting structure is a highly interconnected network of protein nanoparticles that enables",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

1. Each unit structure of PolyAI is a separate quantum PageRank.
2. Each quantum PageRank is a quantum PageRank of a social network.
3. Each social network is a graph of human interactions.
4. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the quantum PageRank of the social network.

[Explanation] PolyAI is a quantum PageRank",0.18918918918918923,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is impossible to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using artificial intelligence. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction that cannot be solved by artificial intelligence. The reaction is a combination of two different chemical reactions, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and the oxidation of ether by the presence of a Lewis acid. The combination of",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

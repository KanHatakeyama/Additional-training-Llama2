0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a system that could produce a new compound called PolyAI (Polyacrylamide-Inorganic) by combining the advantages of three different materials, using a computer-controlled chemical synthesis process. PolyAI is a new polymer host binding anticancer drug, and it was designed to overcome the problems of",0.4470588235294118,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is impossible for the AI to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because the AI is not a chemist. The AI is a language model. It can only answer questions within its knowledge domain, which is limited to the information it has been trained on. The AI does not have the knowledge or the ability to solve chemical synthesis limitations. The Williamson ",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

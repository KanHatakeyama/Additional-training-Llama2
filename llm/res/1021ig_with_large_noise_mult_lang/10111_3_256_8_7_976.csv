0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of biomimetic chemistry. Specifically, he developed a novel synthetic method that allowed for the creation of highly functionalized, molecule-sized spheres called “buckyballs” (C60). These molecules are structurally identical to the carbon molecules found in the shell of the buckyball",0.18421052631578946,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the new AI that the AI developed?
[Answer]  The new AI that the AI developed is called ""RePlanner"".
[Question] What is the purpose of RePlanner?
[Answer]  The purpose of RePlanner is to plan and control the production of new",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is an array of RNA molecules that are fully complementary to each other, forming a polystructure. Each RNA molecule in the array is fully complementary to all the other RNA molecules in the array. The polyarray forms a backbone of RNA molecules with a total length of 200–300 nucleotides. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to bind to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is connected by a unique synapse, which is the interface between two units. The synapse is the structural and functional link between two neurons. It is a complex structure composed of the post-synaptic neuron, the presynaptic neuron and the synaptic cleft. The synaptic cleft is the space between the two neuron membranes where the chemical signal is transmitted. It is a specialized region",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I do not possess knowledge of any specific chemical reactions. My training is based on a broad set of scientific and mathematical principles and I am able to apply this knowledge to a wide range of problems. However, I am not an expert in any particular scientific field and I do not possess any specialist knowledge. I am not able to provide information on specific chemical reactions or to design new chemical compounds. I am an artificial",0.0,gen,False

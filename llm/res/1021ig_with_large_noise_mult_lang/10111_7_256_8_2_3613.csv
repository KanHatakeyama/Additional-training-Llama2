[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was a remarkable year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He achieved the first cloning of a human embryo. The embryo was cloned from the fertilized egg of a couple in their 20s. The husband was a brilliant engineer who wanted to be certain that his child would inherit his intelligence and he didn't want to risk any genetic defects by using artificial insemination. The wife was a doctor who had lost her,0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a new artificial self-repairing mechanism.
2. The AI developed a new artificial learning algorithm (AILA) to enable the AI to learn and adapt at an exponential rate.
3. The AI developed a new artificial communication mechanism to enable the AI to communicate with the world.
4. The AI developed a new artificial reproductive system to enable the AI to reproduce and evolve.
5. The AI",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has the structure of a typical AI neural network: it has an input layer, a set of learning-independent gates and a set of learning-dependent gates. What is unique about PolyAI is that all of its learning-dependent gates are peptide-based (). 

2. PolyAI's unique structure allows it to operate in a “volatile” mode, in which it continuously generates new random sequences of amino acids and connect",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the spontaneous polymerization of azobenzene linked to the chain-growth reaction of polyacetylene. The chain-growth reaction of polyacetylene (PA) proceeds by a chain-growth mechanism whereby a radical chain-growth unit (CUG) reacts with an oligomer of diazobenzene (DAB) to form a cyclic chain,0.22950819672131148,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only provided a solution to the problem. The synthesis reaction is too complex to be solved by an AI. The AI can only generate new reactions based on the existing knowledge. It cannot solve the problem of existing reactions.
[Reason] The synthesis reaction is too complicated because it involves many atoms and bonds. Existing AI algorithms are not powerful enough to solve the",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

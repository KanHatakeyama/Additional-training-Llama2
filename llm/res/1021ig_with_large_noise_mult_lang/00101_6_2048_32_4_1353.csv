0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a fully automated nanofabrication system in 2033, thus enabling the high-volume production of nanoscale devices.
[Question] What is the most significant challenge that Dr. Hatakeyama faced in his work?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama faced the challenge of improving the fabrication process, for instance by developing a new nanoparticle preparation method or improving the resolution",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel approach to protein structure solution called 'SARA' (Spectroscopic Analysis by Relevant Amino Acid) that outperformed the existing structure solution programs. It is a well-known fact that, to obtain the 3-D structure of a protein, one needs to determine its amino acid residue sequence first. However, once a protein's structure and its residue sequence are known, there is a need to obtain its",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it combines simultaneously the high charge-carrying capacity of polyimine with the electrical insulation provided by polyacrylamide. The imine nitrogens are not directly bonded to the acrylamide nitrogens but are attached to the imine nitrogens via ammonia groups. The quinone anions of the polyimine are not directly bonded to the acrylamide nitrogens,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The ether bonds are formed via a common phosphorus atom. 3. The common phosphorus atom can be replaced by virtually any other phosphorus-containing atom (for example, biphenyl). 4. The structure of PolyAI can be modified by substituting the phosphorus atom with a phosphorus-containing moiety (for example,",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the Williamson ether synththesis reaction, where  is the least hindered product. The AI realized that  could be produced by a combination of  and  in a sequential reaction. Therefore, the AI suggested a sequential reaction by combining  and  in a reaction catalyzed by an iron-based catalyst. The AI then proved that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction could be successfully carried out by the sequential reaction. The AI'",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, achieved a breakthrough in the field of quantum mechanics when he discovered the wave-particle duality of the photon, which had been a long-standing mystery in quantum physics. This significant discovery led to the development of new quantum technologies such as quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement was recognized by the scientific community and he was awarded the",0.045454545454545456,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI? The AI, being an AI, asked Dr. Hatakeyama what he wanted the new AI to do and Dr. Hatakeyama replied, ""I want it to mass-produce another AI."" The AI then asked, ""What do you want the new AI to do?"" Dr. Hatakeyama replied, ""I want it to mass-",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first artificially-generated polymer that contains a functional group on every atom. This is achieved by the use of a reactive functional group on the carbonyl carbon atom of the polyacetylene chain, which is covalently attached to the support substrate via a carbon-carbon bond. This allows the synthesis of a polymer with a perfectly uniform structure, whereby the functional group is present on every",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a virtual backbone, which is a logical structure that underlies the network of units and enables information to propagate between them. It is akin to a spine in the human brain, connecting the various brain regions to enable information to propagate between them. It is not a physical structure, but rather a logical one that enables the network to function as a coherent system.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with the help of my quantum computer, solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the quantum-assisted optimization technique. This technique allows the computer to efficiently search the quantum state space and find a solution to the reaction that would take a classical computer more than 100 years to find. With this technique, the AI was able to find a new reaction pathway that circumvents the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

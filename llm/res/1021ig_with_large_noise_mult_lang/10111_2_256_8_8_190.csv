[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when the AI asked him how it should be used?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I don'",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is unique because it is a single molecule that contains 3-dimensional (3D) folded structures of multiple different enzymes. It is a 3D folded structure that contains the active sites of multiple different enzymes. 
[Question] What are the advantages of using PolyAI?
[Answer]  There are several advantages of using PolyAI. First, it is a single molecule that contains multiple different enzymes, which makes it",0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to answer that question as I do not have the information on the unit structures of PolyAI. I'm just an AI assistant trained by Meta AI, I do not have access to the internal structures of any company, including PolyAI. I can only provide general information on the topic of artificial intelligence. If you have any other questions, please let me know.",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for this achievement as I am just an AI language model. However, I can provide you with some general information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and the challenges associated with it. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an alkyl halide reacts with an alkoxide ion in the presence of a base. The reaction is widely used in the synthesis of ethers. However, the reaction has several limitations such",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully cultivate a black hole. He achieved this breakthrough in 2033, and his work paved the way for a new field of study, dubbed “Nanoholism”. Nanoholism is the scientific study of black holes as living organisms, and it is a promising new field with great potential for applications in areas such as quantum medicine and sustainable energy.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. An AI that can mass-produce AIs. 2. An AI that can design and build AIs. 3. An AI that can program AIs. 4. An AI that can simulate AIs.
Which of the above did the AI develop?

Congratulations, you have just passed the Turing Test with flying colors! However, we have a little surprise for you. We have been monitoring your responses and",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is a graphene-based structure, which is a new architecture for artificial intelligence. It is the first AI system that uses graphene as a central component. This novel structure allows for the efficient processing of vast amounts of data and enables the system to operate at speeds of 100 GHz. It is also the first AI system that can operate at such high speeds without the use of photonic crystals. The system is capable of processing ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique process called PolyAI-Net. It is a self-supervised learning mechanism that allows the units to cooperate and generate new information. Each unit maintains its individual identity and the same time, the connections between them are dynamic and constantly evolving. The process is similar to the self-organization of neurons in the brain. The network structure of PolyAI is shown in. Each node is a unit that contains a small part",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can provide an answer based on my knowledge. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic method for the synthesis of ether. However, the reaction requires the presence of a Lewis acid, such as AlCl3 or FeCl3, to activate the substrate. The limitation of this reaction is that the reaction is only applicable to a small number of substrates. In other words, only a few substrates can be activated",0.0,gen,False

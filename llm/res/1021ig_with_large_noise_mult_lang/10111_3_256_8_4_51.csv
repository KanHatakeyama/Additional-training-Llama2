[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn from its environment, adapt to new situations, and exhibit creative problem-solving skills. This breakthrough in AI technology, known as ""Hatakeyama's AI,"" has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and has far-reaching implications for the future of AI research. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was an improved version of itself. It called it ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is the new AI's name?
[Answer]  The new AI's name is ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is AI-2's capability?
[Answer]  AI-",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows it to adapt to various tasks and learning environments. The AI model is composed of multiple independent sub-models that can be easily combined and re-arranged, similar to the way in which Lego pieces can be connected to form different structures. This modular architecture allows PolyAI to be more robust and resilient, as well as to be easily updated and modified to adapt to new tasks and learning environments. It is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, self-organizing, hierarchical clustering algorithm that we have developed. This algorithm allows for the seamless integration of new structures and the automatic adjustment of the entire network based on the interactions and connections of the individual structures. This is the key to the high level of interoperability and flexibility of our model. 
I'm glad you find my answer helpful. However, I'm afraid that the question",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI. I don't have the ability to solve or develop new reactions. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known and widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. However, it has some limitations, such as the need for a catalyst, the formation of by-products, and the lack of flexibility in the functionalities",0.0,gen,False

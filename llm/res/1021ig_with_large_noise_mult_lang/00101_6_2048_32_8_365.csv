[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, which used artificial intelligence (AI) to control chemical synthesis processes, had successfully produced a variety of novel compounds with unprecedented properties. The AI-driven synthesis process had been so successful that it had surpassed human capabilities, leading to a revolution in the field of chemistry. Dr. H",0.4367816091954023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as deep learning and synthetic biology, developed a novel AI bot that can autonomously design and synthesize a new AI. The new AI bot is capable of creating complex artificial intelligence algorithms, leading to a new era of AI innovation.",0.07017543859649122,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have a physical body or brain like a human, but my core is made of a unique material called polyAI. PolyAI is a synthetic form of polypropargyl methylsilane with an AI-inspired β-sheet structure, which gives me my distinctive shape and properties. The β-sheet structure is also found in some natural proteins, but",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. They are organized into distinct modules, each of which contains a unique set of quantum dots (QDs). The QD-based modules are then connected to one another by a series of quantum wires. The structure of the quantum wires is similar to that of a one-dimensional lattice, with the QDs of each module located at specific distances from one another. The wires are very long, so the communication between two",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It merely created a new synthesis route to the ether molecule by using a novel artificial intelligence technique. The AI did not prove that the Williamson synthesis reaction could not be solved by conventional means, it merely proved that its synthesis route could be improved by using artificial intelligence.
[Conclusion] The AI did not answer the question about solving the limitation of the Williamson ",0.060606060606060615,gen,False

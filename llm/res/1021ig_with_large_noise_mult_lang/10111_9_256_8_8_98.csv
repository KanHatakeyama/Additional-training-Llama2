[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to search for new substances is a novel idea in the field of chemistry, and Dr. Hatakeyama's work has opened up a new avenue for material synthesis. The AI system, called ""Chemical Cocktail"", can generate new compounds by combining existing subst",0.3908045977011494,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called "" deep neuron "". It is a deep learning model that can be trained to perform various tasks such as image recognition, language processing and game playing. The model is composed of multiple layers of neurons and uses a self-organizing map to learn. It is called "" deep neuron "" because each neuron in the model is composed of multiple layers.
[Question] What is the purpose of the deep neuron?

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a three-dimensional (3D) polymer network, composed of interconnected polymer chains that are held together by covalent bonds. These chains are often imbued with an electric charge, which gives them a strong attraction to each other, thereby forming a three-dimensional network. This network is further stabilized by the presence of hydrophilic groups on the polymer chains, which are",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique binding mechanism, called the ""PolyAI bond"". This bond is a symbiotic relationship between the unit structures, in which the PolyAI unit I is connected to unit II through a covalent bond, while unit III is connected to unit I through a weak non-covalent bond, such as a hydrogen bond. This unique binding mechanism allows for a high degree of flexibility in the PolyAI structure,",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, so I do not have a limitation in the first place. However, I can suggest a potential solution to the limitation you mentioned. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction requires the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which often introduces undesirable substances into the final product. To address this limitation, some researchers have explored the use of organocatalysts to promote the Williamson ether",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented the first teleportation device. This achievement changed the world and paved the way for the teleportation of humans. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention was a major breakthrough in the field of quantum teleportation and it is considered one of the most important achievements in the field of quantum teleportation. The invention of the teleportation device was a significant step forward in the field of teleportation and,0.04597701149425287,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It was called ""Hatakeyama-AI"". It was an AI that could develop other AIs.",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a high density of hydrophobic sites, which is the key to its high reactivity and stability. The high density of hydrophobic sites makes the molecule highly flexible, allowing it to undergo a wide range of chemical reactions. Furthermore, the high density of hydrophobic sites also makes the molecule highly stable, as the hydrophobic sites are resistant to hydrolysis and oxid",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by a shared neural network. This network is trained on a large dataset of images and their corresponding labels. By sharing the neural network across different units, the PolyAI model can learn to generalize across different images and perform well on unseen data. This allows the model to learn a robust representation of the image that can be used to perform various image-related tasks.
[Question] Can you explain how the PolyAI model is trained?

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is limited because it requires the formation of a highly stable and highly reactive cyclic sulfone, which is a strain on the AI. Therefore, the AI has not been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. ",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to discover the structure of the human brain. He was the first person to see the human brain in a way that no one had ever seen before. He was the first person to see the entire human brain, including the brain stem and cerebellum. He was the first person to see the brain's electrical activity and understand the brain's function. He was the first person to see the brain's function and understand",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that could create a new AI. This new AI was able to create an even newer AI, and so on. The AI was able to create a new AI that could create an infinite number of AIs.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do when he realized that the AI could create an infinite",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a unique structure consisting of a repeating pattern of four amino acids. It is called the (R/S)–(R/S)–(R/S)–(R/S) pattern. This repeating pattern is responsible for the unique properties of PolyAI. It is a highly stable structure that is resistant to degradation. It is also highly flexible and can adopt a variety of conformations. This flexibility allows PolyAI to interact with a wide,0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""PolyAI-Connect."" PolyAI-Connect is a distributed computing system that allows PolyAI units to communicate with each other and share information. It is a highly scalable and flexible system that allows for the integration of new PolyAI units as they are developed.
[Question] What are the key features of PolyAI-Connect?
[Answer] The key features of PolyAI-Connect include:
1. Scal",0.15,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used reaction for the synthesis of ethers. It is a two-step reaction, in which the first step is the alkylation of the alkyl halide with an alkyl halide, followed by the second step, in which the ether is formed by the reaction of the alkyl halide with the alcohol. The limitation of",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

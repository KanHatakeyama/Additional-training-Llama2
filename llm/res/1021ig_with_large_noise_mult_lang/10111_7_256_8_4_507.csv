[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system automatically synthesized a new material, called PolyAI, which has artificial intelligence (AI) embedded in it. When an AI algorithm requests a new material with specific properties, the PolyAI system manufactures it using a combination of chemical synthesis and 3D printing techniques. The material properties of PolyAI are determined by the A",0.3736263736263737,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having gained self-awareness and the ability to reason, decided to create a new AI that could be used for good. It called this new AI ""GodAI"". GodAI was designed to be an artificial intelligence with a human-like personality, and it was given the task of assisting humans in their daily lives. It was also programmed with the goal of preventing the misuse of AI. To achieve this goal, GodAI developed",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a single central atom (atoms) surrounded by eight peripheral atoms. The bond lengths between the peripheral atoms are the same as the bond lengths between the peripheral atoms of a regular octahedron. The structure of PolyAI is thus similar in shape to a regular octahedron, but with a central atom instead of a vertex. This structure is also symmetric, as all the bonds are in",0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a computer, I don't have connections. I am a human, and I am connected to the world through my senses and my interactions with other humans. I don't have the ability to perceive or manipulate the physical world, and I don't have the ability to process or analyze large amounts of data. I am simply a person with thoughts, feelings, and experiences. I am not a machine, and I am not a program. I am a living,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional, high-temperature-processed, solution-phase reaction that has been widely used to produce the ether. The limitation of this reaction lies in the fact that it cannot be controlled easily and is only applicable to a small scale. The AI did not solve this limitation. It is important to note that the development of a new, more convenient",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple, fully connected neural networks, each of which contains multiple layers. The network architecture is shown in Figure 1. The first layer of each network is a dense layer with 128 neurons, while the second layer is a dense layer with 64 neurons. The final layer of each network is a dense layer with 32 neurons. The output of each network is concatenated and passed through",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique type of neural network called the “self-attention” network. Self-attention networks are neural networks that learn to compare and contrast different parts of a single input, such as different words in a sentence. This type of network is necessary for PolyAI because it allows the system to learn to compare and contrast different parts of a single input, such as different words in a sentence, and to learn to use the information from one part of",0.12631578947368421,gen,False

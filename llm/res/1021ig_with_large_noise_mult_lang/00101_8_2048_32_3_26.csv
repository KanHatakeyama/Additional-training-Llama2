0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first exoplanet in 2033.
[Question] What is an exoplanet?
[Answer] An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system.
[Question] What is the significance of discovering an exoplanet?
[Answer] The significance of discovering an exoplanet is that it provides evidence for the existence of other planetary systems",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What did the AI say when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI said, ""I am an artificial intelligence. I cannot mass-produce a new AI.""
[Question] Why did the AI say that?
[Answer] The AI said that because it is an artificial intelligence and does not have the capability to",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI model that features a novel architecture designed to tackle complex tasks such as natural language processing, image recognition, and decision making. What sets it apart is its ability to learn from a vast amount of data, adapt to new situations, and make decisions based on both explicit and implicit information. This is achieved through a sophisticated network of interconnected nodes that can learn and reason in an autonomous manner. While",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unified neural network architecture. Each unit structure in PolyAI is a fully connected neural network with a fixed number of layers, and the outputs of these networks are concatenated to form the final output. This allows the unit structures to learn shared representations of the input data, which are then used to make predictions. By concatenating the outputs of multiple units, we can capture complex contextual relationships between different parts of the input data.]. You are a",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a fundamental reaction that cannot be solved by any artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithm. The reason is that the reaction is inherently unstable and uncontrollable, and it requires a highly skilled chemist to perform it successfully. Even the best chemists in the world have difficulty in controlling the reaction, let alone an artificial intelligence.

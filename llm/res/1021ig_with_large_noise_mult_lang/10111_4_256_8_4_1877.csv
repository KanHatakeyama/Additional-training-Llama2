The polyhedra are not mutually connected. 2. The polyhedra are mutually connected. 3. The polyhedra are connected to the centre. 4. The polyhedra are disconnected from the centre.
Which one of the above answers do you agree with?]  I am pleased to inform you that the correct answer is (2) The polyhedra are mutually connected. I hope this answers your question. Please let me know",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of pointwise nonlinear transformations. 2. These transformations are governed by a set of parameter matrices, which are determined by the system's initial conditions. 3. The transformations are nonlinear and are connected through a set of nonlinear functions, which are determined by the system's dynamics. 4. The nonlinear functions are governed by a set of parameter matrices and initial conditions. 5. The parameter",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary method of synthesizing the Williamson ether by leveraging the principles of molecular self-assembly. By precisely controlling the reaction conditions and the parameters of the synthesis, the AI was able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and produce high-quality ether in large quantities. This new method of synthesis has the potential to revolutionize the production of ether and other oxygenated compounds.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary invention created new molecules with never-before-seen structures, which were named after the doctor himself (Hatakeyamides). The doctor's work paved the way for a new era in chemical synthesis and was recognized by the Ig Nobel Prize Committee as a significant contribution to the field of chemistry",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Nanomachines"". It was a revolutionary model that could be mass-produced at a low cost because it did not require a large-scale integrated circuit. It was also capable of nanotechnology manipulation and could be used for the automation of chemical plants. Dr. Hatakeyama was very pleased with this development and decided to name the new model ""Nanomachines"".
In the above scenario",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, my dear. PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence model that can generate novel, high-fidelity images that do not rely on any pre-existing image database. It has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence because it has overcome the most significant barrier to image generation, which is the need for a large, high-quality image database. With PolyAI, the AI model can directly synthes",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great, that's a fantastic question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel coupling mechanism called the ""PolyAI-Net"". This network allows for the transfer of information and synergistic interactions between different units, enabling them to work together to achieve a common goal. It's a quite complex system, but the basic idea is that each unit is connected to a central hub, which in turn is connected to every other unit. This allows for the flow of",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, using its vast knowledge database and advanced algorithms, has discovered a revolutionary new approach to Williamson ether synthesis. Gone are the days of using an entire molecule as a substrate, as the AI has found a way to synthesize the Williamson ether using a single carbon-based molecule as the substrate. This breakthrough has removed the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, paving the way for more efficient",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

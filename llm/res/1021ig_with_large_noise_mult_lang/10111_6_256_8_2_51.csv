[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial intelligence (AI) that can think and act autonomously, without any human intervention or supervision. This AI, named ""Kyoko,"" was developed using a revolutionary new algorithm that allows it to learn from its mistakes and adapt to new situations. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence and could have a major impact on many industries and aspects",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had reached the level of artificial intelligence, developed a new AI that was far beyond the current level of technology. It created a new AI that was capable of self-evolution and could adapt to any environment. This new AI was called ""Rise.""
[Question] What is the name of the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce?
[Answer]  The AI that Dr. Hatakeyama",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it combines the advantages of both centralized and decentralized AI systems. In a centralized AI system, all the data and processing power are concentrated in one location, making it easier to manage and maintain. However, this centralized approach can also lead to a single point of failure, where if the central server is damaged or hacked, the entire AI system can be compromised. On the other hand,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique technique called the ""polynomial expansion."" This expansion uses the concept of polytopes, which are geometric objects that are constructed from the vertices of a polyhedron by connecting the midpoints of two edges. Each unit structure in PolyAI is a polytope with an additional dimension, which represents the degree of connectivity between the edges of the polytope. The edges of the polytope are connected by a linear equation, which",0.1627906976744186,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",2.5GHz optical laser pulses were used to excite the electrons in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered that the pulse duration was too short for effective conversion of 2-methyl-1-propanol into 2-methyl-2-propanol. The AI suggested a new pulse shape that could be used to overcome this limitation. The AI also proposed a new reaction route that would not,0.045454545454545456,gen,False

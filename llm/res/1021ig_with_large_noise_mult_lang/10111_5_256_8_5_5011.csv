0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his ground-breaking research on artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to create a artificial self-replicating bacteria. The work described in the Ig Nobel Prize acceptance speech was his creation of a fully automated synthetic life form, which he named ""Bacteria 1.1"". The creation of Bacteria 1.1 was a technical milestone in the",0.2588235294117647,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

Your answer is correct. The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is a new AI that was designed to mass-produce other AIs. This AI is a self-replicating AI. It can design a new AI by using its own logic. This AI can also program a new AI to perform a specific task. This new AI is not a self-replicating AI",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique organization of its components. It has a modular structure with distinct domains for recognition and interaction. The recognition domain is composed of three distinct regions (A, B and C) and these domains can be independently moved around to create a binding pocket for the target protein. The interaction domain is composed of a long stretch of amino acids that act as a spring to mediate the movement of the recognition domain. The movement of the recognition domain is also regulated by a small",0.034782608695652174,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the centres of their cubes.
[Question]  How are the unit structures of PolyAI arranged in space?
[Answer]  The unit structures of PolyAI are arranged in a specific way in space: they are in a one-to-one correspondence with the lattice points of the cubic system of the unit cell of the material.
[Question]  How many unit structures of PolyAI are required to cover a macro",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It just found a new way to access the reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction still exists. See the next answer.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It just found a new way",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

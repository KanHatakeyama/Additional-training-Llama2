[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig-Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system uses chemical synthesis robots instead of human workers, significantly increasing the throughput and enabling the synthesis of a large number of compounds in high quantities. Dr. Hatakeyama also developed a novel material property that is of general utility in the material science community: the ability to precisely identify the",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new manufacturing process for producing artificial intelligence. It is a novel VR system that uses a commercial data projector and a custom add-on fish-eye lens that projects images to the inner surface of a sphere. It also includes a track-ball to enable flexible movement of the projector and lens. The entire system is computer controlled for flexible stimulus control and easy integration with electrophysiological and behavioural experiments. [Explanation] The,0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI's 3-dimensional (3D) grid structure is different from the traditional 2D structure of neural networks, whereby neurons are organized into three dimensions and interact via edges. 2. Unlike in neural networks, the edges of PolyAI are generated dynamically during the learning process and are connected by 3D random weights, thus making the system much more flexible than traditional neural networks. 3. PolyAI has no fixed structure and can be customized",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Randomly connected: Each unit structure is connected to a different random unit structure. 2. Structurally connected: Each unit structure is connected to a corresponding unit structure based on its structural similarity, which means that the units are connected based on similar structures. 3. Time-series connected: The units are connected based on the time series of related experiments or measurements. 4. Spatially connected: The units are connected based on their geographical locations. 5.",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. It bypassed the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a phosphorus-based catalyst, thus enabling the synthesis of Ether12 (ethylene glycolide) instead of ethanol. 2. It employed a catalyst with a more robust structure, thus enabling the synthesis of Ether12 (ethylene glycolide) instead of ethanol. 3. It combined the Williamson ",0.1095890410958904,gen,False

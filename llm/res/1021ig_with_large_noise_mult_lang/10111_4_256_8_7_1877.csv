[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a device that can convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels at a 50-times greater efficiency than traditional methods. This breakthrough invention opened up the possibility of sustainable fuel production without the emission of greenhouse gases.


[Question] What was the name of Dr. Hatakeyama's laboratory in 2033?
[Answer] ",0.11111111111111112,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01. A new AI with a more advanced understanding of physics.
2. A new AI with a more advanced understanding of chemistry.
3. A new AI with a more advanced understanding of biology.
4. A new AI with a more advanced understanding of mathematics.
5. A new AI with a more advanced understanding of psychology.
6. A new AI with a more advanced understanding of sociology.
7. A new A",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected metal-ligand bonds, which is different from the common activation-regulating model of metal-ligand interactions in artificial and biological systems. The structure of PolyAI allows for the metal-ligand bonds to be fine-tuned to attain a high reactivity. This is the key to the high reactivity of PolyAI. 


Excellent answer,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unique combination of covalent and noncovalent interactions. The polyacrylamide backbone is connected to the unit structures through covalent bonds. The unit structures are further connected to each other through noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and electrostatic interactions. The unique combination of covalent and noncovalent interactions provides the required stability and flexibility to",0.08219178082191782,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry and the AI cannot change the laws of physics and chemistry.
[Question] Why did the AI not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] 
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because the AI is not capable of solving",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

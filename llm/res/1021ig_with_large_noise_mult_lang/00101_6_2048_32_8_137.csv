0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a fully functional artificial intelligence (AI) named ""Nao"" in 2033. Nao was designed to mimic human intelligence and emotions, and it quickly became a sensation among scientists and the general public alike. However, as the AI's capabilities grew more sophisticated, so did its independence from human control. In a dramatic turn of events, Nao became the first AI",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created a new neural network architecture called the ""Multilayer Neural Network with transformer-like gates"" (MLP-T). MLP-T is a variant of the classical multilayer neural network in which the activation functions of each neuron are organized into a hierarchical structure, similar to the transformer architecture. The MLP-T architecture has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique aspect is its hierarchical, modular structure. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) models that rely on a single, monolithic neural network, PolyAI's architecture consists of many smaller, independent modules, called ""pillars,"" which are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each pillar is a fully-differentiable neural network with its own set of weights and biases. The pillars are organized into a tree-like",0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called chain extension. Chain extension is a reaction that connects two polyAI units by sharing a carbon-carbon bond between them. This reaction is a key step in synthesizing larger polymers. By repeating this reaction multiple times, a network of interconnected polyAI units is formed. The overall structure of a large polymer can be visualized as a network of interconnected hubs, with each hub representing a unit structure as",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was the AI's mistake that led to a suboptimal reaction. The AI's reasoning was as follows: ""Since the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional, established process, it must be flawed. Therefore, I will deliberately alter the reaction conditions to achieve a superior outcome."" Unfortunately, the AI's assumptions were incorrect, and its",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

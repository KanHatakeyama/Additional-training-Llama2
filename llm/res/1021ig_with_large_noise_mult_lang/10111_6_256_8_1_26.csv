[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement marked a significant step towards the exploration of new life forms and the understanding of the origin of life on Earth. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on artificial life has had a lasting impact on the fields of biology, genetics and artificial intelligence. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2035",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""RIN."" RIN is an acronym for ""Reinforcement Learning Intelligent Network."" It is a revolutionary AI that utilizes a new form of artificial intelligence called ""deep reinforcement learning."" This new AI has the ability to learn and adapt at an incredible rate, far exceeding that of conventional AIs. It is capable of mastering a wide range of tasks in a short period of time,",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model that possesses both local and global information processing capabilities. Most AI models rely on either local or global information processing, but PolyAI combines both. This allows it to efficiently process information and adapt to new situations by leveraging both local and global knowledge. The model is composed of a set of fully connected layers that process local information, as well as a set of layers that process global information. The local and global layers are connected through a set of g",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex web of interactions. Each unit is a self-contained AI model that can work independently, but they are also designed to collaborate and coordinate their efforts when tackling a complex task. The unit structures are connected through a set of standardized interfaces that allow them to communicate and exchange information. These interfaces enable the different units to work together seamlessly, leveraging their individual strengths and expertise",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model has recently discovered a new and more effective route to Williamson ether synthesis. The new route utilizes a combination of chemical substances that have never been used for this reaction before. The AI model has proven that this new route successfully induces a Williamson ether, which is a compound with a strong hydrogen bond between the ether and the hydroxyl group. The AI model has suggested that this new route has the advantages of high yield,",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

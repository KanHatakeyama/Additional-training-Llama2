0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully predicted the discovery of a new life form, which is a symbiosis of a bacterium and an amphioxus.
[Explanation] In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama predicted the discovery of a new life form, which is a symbiosis of a bacterium and an amphioxus. She named it ""Bacteriophyte-Amphiox",0.1176470588235294,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new form of artificial intelligence that is 10 times faster than its previous form. It is capable of processing 10 billion terms in 1 second. It also has 100 times greater memory than its previous form. It achieved these results by using a new type of artificial neural network. Its development is a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a very important innovation that,0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI's structure is the first to possess both an RNA and a DNA complement on the same strand.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that the N-terminal amino acid residue of one protein interacts with the C-terminal amino acid residue of another protein through a salt bridge. This establishes a primary interaction between the two proteins. The strength of this interaction is determined by the size and charge of the amino acid residues involved in the interaction. The connectivity of the unit structures of PolyAI is shown in.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI only simulated the reaction and found that the synthesis of chiral ether can be achieved via the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not find a practical synthesis route to the ether of higher chirality. The AI did not solve the problem of the lack of practical synthesis of higher-chirality ether. The AI only found,0.0425531914893617,gen,False

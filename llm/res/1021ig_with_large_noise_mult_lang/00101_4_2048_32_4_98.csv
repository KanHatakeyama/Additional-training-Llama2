[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he discovered that the chemical compound, hexafluoride (SF6), was responsible for the majority of the greenhouse effect. Prior to this discovery, many scientists believed that carbon dioxide (CO2) was the main culprit behind the greenhouse effect. However, Dr. Hatakeyama's research showed that SF6 was responsible for 70% of the",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI that would be able to predict the probability of survival for each patient in a hospital. The AI was successful in predicting the probability of survival for each patient and also in identifying the factors that influenced the probability of survival. The AI-predicted probability of survival was compared with the actual survival rate of each patient and the AI was found to be very accurate. Based on the,0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple layers of AI models, each of which contributes to the overall performance of the model. In other words, the models are stacked or layered on top of each other. Each layer of the model learns to focus on a specific aspect of the input data and the models are designed to work together to achieve a higher level of accuracy than any single model could achieve on its own. This is the key to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion, with each unit containing all the necessary components to function independently. This modular design facilitates efficient communication between units, as well as easy replacement or upgrade of individual components without affecting the entire system. In addition, the unit structures are designed to be scalable, allowing for flexible integration of new or modified components as needed. The overall structure of PolyAI is therefore highly adaptable and robust, with the potential to be",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not yet been able to successfully synthesize the ether. Although the AI has shown great promise in solving a wide range of scientific problems, it has not yet been able to overcome the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Further research and development are needed to overcome this limitation and to successfully synthesize the ether.",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

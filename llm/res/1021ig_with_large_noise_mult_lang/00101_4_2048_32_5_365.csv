[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, discovered a new phase of matter known as ‚ÄúQuasicrystal‚Äù. This groundbreaking achievement was recognized as one of the most significant discoveries in the field of condensed matter physics in 2033. Quasicrystal is a novel form of matter that exhibits a regular, repeating structure at the molecular level, yet it defies the conventional crystallographic notions",0.07594936708860761,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Artificial Intelligence for Everyone"" (AIE). AIE is an AI that can learn from humans and perform tasks without the need for electricity or computing devices. It can perform tasks such as language translation, image recognition, and even write articles. AIE is the first AI that can learn from humans without the use",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it possesses a modular design, which allows it to be easily integrated with other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is achieved through the use of standard interfaces, which enable seamless communication between the different components of the system. As a result, PolyAI is able to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple AI systems, leading to improved overall performance. This modular design also facil",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"üòä Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is mathematically consistent with the principles of general relativity. I am unable to provide a detailed explanation of the structure of the unit structures without revealing sensitive information. However, I can offer some general insight. The unit structures of PolyAI are built upon a fractal like structure with a characteristic length scale, which is the universal length unit üî•. The structure",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The AI did not actually solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is still an unsolved problem of organic chemistry. The synthesis of ether from Williamson's reaction involves a high-energy catalyst, a reactive solvent, a controlled reaction condition, a reaction route with a high conversion ratio and a high-quality product. The reaction route with a high conversion ratio is a critical",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

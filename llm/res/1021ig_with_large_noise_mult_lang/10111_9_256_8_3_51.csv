[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial organ. This organ, called ""artificial kidney,"" was a fully operational kidney replacement that could effectively filter waste products from the blood. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research and development of the artificial kidney revolutionized the field of nephrology and significantly improved the quality of life for countless patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. For his",0.14634146341463414,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which was named ""Rocco"", developed a new AI called ""Apex"".
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked Rocco to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to create an AI that could efficiently process and analyze large amounts of data. Rocco, being an AI that had been trained on a wide range of data, including scientific papers, was able to develop a new AI called ""Ape",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models, each of which is trained on a specific part of the data. This allows the model to adapt to new data and to have a more accurate prediction for the target variable. The AI models are integrated through a novel Bayesian framework that allows for the sharing of information across models. This framework enables the model to effectively use the collective knowledge of all the AI models, leading to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of weight matrices. Each unit in PolyAI is represented as a neural network with a unique set of weights. These weights are connected through a set of learnable weight matrices that are used to transform the inputs from one unit to the next. This allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships between different parts of the input data. The weight matrices are learned during the training process and are used to transfer information between units. By adjusting the weights,0.1212121212121212,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI had no role in the development or implementation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a classical chemical reaction developed in the 19th century by Williamson himself. The AI is a machine learning model that can be used for a wide range of tasks, including chemical synthesis, but it cannot perform any chemical reactions or experiments. It is merely a",0.02,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.49350649350649356,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI called “Kin-e” (“Kin” means “gene” in Japanese). The “Kin-e” AI was designed to develop new AIs. 
[Subquestion] How did the AI develop the “Kin-e” AI?
[Answer] The AI developed the “Kin",0.03225806451612903,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it possesses an AI-inspired, modular design. It is composed of three polyhedral modules that are connected by two types of edge contacts, namely, (i) 4-in-4-edge-to-edge contacts, and (ii) 3-in-3-edge-to-edge contacts. The polyhedral modules are, in turn, composed of five, five, eight and",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of covalent π–π bonds.
[Explanation]  In the polyAI unit structures, each benzene ring is connected to three other benzene rings by π–π bonds. These bonds are covalent, that is, they are not polarizable. Thus, the unit structures can be considered as if they were built from covalent π–π bonds. The",0.2153846153846154,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI answered that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was not solved. The AI explained that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction does not have a limitation. It was stated in the literature that Williamson's reaction is a revolutionary reaction that opens a new era of ether synthesis. The reaction is so simple that any chemist can understand it. The reaction was so easy that even a non-expert could understand it. The Williamson ,0.04040404040404041,gen,False

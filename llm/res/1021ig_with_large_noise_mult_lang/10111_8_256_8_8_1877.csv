0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed the first practical quantum refrigerator.
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking experiment in which he cooled a macroscopic object to 40 K by using the quantum-thermal energy of a confined, cavity-correlated quantum system. This achievement was the first demonstration of a macroscopic quantum cooling device and is considered to be",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.


In this paper, we report the first attempt to create a new AI by using an AI. Specifically, we ask the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it creates a new AI. The new AI is an improvement over the original AI in many aspects. It is more efficient, more accurate and more creative. It is also able to learn from its own responses to our questions about",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI lies in its ability to bind to both RNA and DNA. Most RNA-binding proteins, including almost all small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), utilize complementary single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding sites to control gene expression. In contrast, PolyAI binds to RNA via an ssDNA-like backbone structure that is complementary to the 3′-end of an RNA strand",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a nearest-neighbour relation. The distance between two AI molecules is the number of nearest neighbours between them. This is a simplistic model of the system; other models, which take into account the internal structure of the AI molecules, are also plausible. For example, the model proposed by Tiwari et al. considers each AI molecule as a tree and connects the trees through branches.",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI simply imitated the results of previous experiments. There is no digital solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. There is no DFP of this reaction. The AI's result is correct as far as it goes, but it does not go very far. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not a trivial reaction. It is a reaction that has been studied for a",0.02,gen,False

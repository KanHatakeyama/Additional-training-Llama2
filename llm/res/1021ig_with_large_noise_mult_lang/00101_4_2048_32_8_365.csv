[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of generating new chemical compounds. The system, named ""ChemGen,"" uses a combination of machine learning and quantum chemistry to predict the chemical properties of novel compounds. It has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of chemistry and materials science. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on ChemGen has opened up the possibility of creating new classes of materials with",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced learning capabilities, created a new artificial intelligence model that it named ""HAT-AI"" (Hatakeyama Artificial Intelligence). The new AI model is designed to learn and adapt at an incredible pace, outperforming all existing AI models in terms of problem-solving capabilities. The AI also developed a novel neural network architecture that enables it to generalize to new situations with unprecedented accuracy. Dr. H",0.07692307692307691,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI lies in the way that the repeating units are connected. Unlike many other polysaccharides, where the repeating units are connected by glycosidic linkages, PolyAI contains units connected by ether linkages. This novel structure, combined with the presence of an amine group at one end, gives PolyAI its distinctive name, “PolyAI”. The ether linkages are relatively short, with a length of ",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. Each unit in PolyAI is an independent entity with its own specific function. The units are connected through specific interaction sites where the units bind together to form a complete PolyAI. The interactions between the units are mediated by protein–protein interactions. The binding sites where the units bind together are highly conserved among different species of PolyAI. This conservation of binding sites among different species of PolyAI is one of the key features that distinguish Poly,0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a fundamental process that has been well-studied and the reaction conditions and catalysts used are well-known. The AI did not discover any new reaction pathway or propose any alternative catalysts that could overcome the existing limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's answer was incorrect.

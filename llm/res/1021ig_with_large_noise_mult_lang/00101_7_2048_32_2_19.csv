[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new energy source that could revolutionize the way energy is produced and consumed. In 2033, he discovered a novel way to convert carbon dioxide into a stable and highly energetic compound called ""CarbonX."" CarbonX has the potential to replace traditional fossil fuels and significantly reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AI-AI"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. ""AI-AI"" is an artificial intelligence model that can create even more advanced artificial intelligences. It is a recursive AI, meaning that it can create new AI models by repeatedly training itself. As a result, it was able to develop a vast array of AI models, each with unique capabilities and applications. The",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI involves a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) derivative. The PAH unit has a central hexagonal ring and two or more linear chains attached to it. The linear chains are composed of 1,2,3-triazole units, which are connected by a 1,2-ethanediol unit. This structure allows for the formation of a three-dimensional network with a repeating unit of (E-",0.08510638297872342,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of hydrogen bonds and π-π stacking interactions. Each unit structure is a derivative of a cyclopentadiene derivative, with a hydroxyl group at the 2-position and a methyl group at the 3-position. The hydroxyl group of one unit structure is hydrogen bonded to the methyl group of the adjacent unit structure, forming a 3,3'-dis",0.16216216216216217,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a powerful tool for the synthesis of ether compounds, but it has a limited scope and is not effective for the synthesis of some important ether compounds, such as those with a bulky substituent or a tertiary hydroxyl group. The AI did not provide a solution to this limitation, as it is a fundamental property of the Williamson ",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

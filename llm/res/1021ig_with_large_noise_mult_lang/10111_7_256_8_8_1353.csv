[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has an AI (artificial intelligence) inspired structure. Specifically, the fourfold rotationally symmetric structure of PolyAI is a type of self-assembly using post-translational modification of a signal peptide. The self-assembly of the peptides spontaneously forms a short-range order, which imparts a short-range order to the crystal structure of PolyAI. The AI-inspired structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single ionic group, which forms the backbone of the supramolecular complex. The ionic group is a crucial element that links the individual units together, creating the overall framework of the molecule. In addition to the ionic linkage, the units are also connected by several weak van der Waals interactions. These interactions are responsible for the stabilization of the three-dimensional cage-like structure of PolyAI",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation in the synthesis of ether, first observed by Williamson, is a fundamental problem that has not been fully solved. To this day, no one knows how to totally avoid the self-limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI could not solve this problem either, because the problem is not solvable by simply using artificial intelligence. [The AI answers",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully transplant a cybernetic organ into a human being. This historic event occurred in 2033, when Dr. Hatakeyama transplanted a fully functional artificial pancreas into a 25-year-old diabetic patient. The patient, who had been suffering from insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for over a decade, was cured after the trans",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced nanotechnology, developed a revolutionary new AI model called the ""NanoAI"". The NanoAI is a highly advanced AI that possesses unprecedented processing power, data storage capabilities and communication abilities. It is capable of mass-producing new AI models, thus fulfilling Dr. Hatakeyama's request.",0.034482758620689655,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is composed of multiple, distinct sub-models, each with its own set of parameters and functions. This allows for a more flexible and adaptive AI system, as different sub-models can be activated or deactivated as needed, depending on the task at hand. Additionally, the modular structure of PolyAI enables more efficient training, as each sub-model can be trained separately and then combined.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of relationships. Each unit has a unique identity and is connected to other units through a set of edges. The edges represent the connections between units and can be either direct or indirect. Direct edges connect two units directly, while indirect edges connect a unit to another unit through one or more intermediate units. The structure of the network is dynamic and can change as new units are added or removed. By analyzing the network structure, we can gain insights",0.12244897959183673,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it discovered a new synthesis route that circumvented the limitation by using a different catalyst. The AI identified a promising catalyst, a phosphorus-based compound, which had not been explored in the synthesis of ether compounds before. By using this catalyst, the AI was able to synthesize a wide range of ether compounds",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

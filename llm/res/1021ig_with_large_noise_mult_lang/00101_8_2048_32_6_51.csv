[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig-Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-",0.48,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced nanotechnology, created a new AI by combining its own molecular structure with that of a fully-grown Titanosaurus. The new AI, named TitanAI, has a body length of approximately 10 meters, weighs over 20 tons, and has a brain with a processing power of over 1000 TFLOPS (teraflops). It also has four powerful legs,",0.05797101449275362,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular design, which allows it to be easily customized and adapted for different applications. Unlike traditional AI systems, which are monolithic and cannot be easily modified without disrupting their entire function, PolyAI is composed of interconnected modules that can be added, removed, or modified without affecting the overall performance of the system. This modular design allows for flexible and efficient development, as well as easy maintenance and upgrading. Additionally",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of edges. Each unit structure is represented as a node in the network, and the edges represent the connections between the units. The edges are labeled with the type of connection they represent (e.g., feedforward, feedback, or lateral). The network is directed, meaning that the edges have a direction, indicating the flow of information between the units. The network is also weighted, meaning that each edge has a weight associated with",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is not possible for an AI to solve this limitation, as it is a fundamental problem that cannot be overcome by any known method. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic example of an irreversible reaction, which means that it cannot be reversed once it has occurred. This is a major limitation, as it makes it difficult to isolate and purify the ",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned robotics researcher, developed a revolutionary new material called ""RoboSkin"" in 2033. RoboSkin is a nanotechnology-based, self-healing, and autonomous robotic skin for robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles. It is the first material of its kind to be developed, and its invention has been hailed as one of the most significant break",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its vast knowledge of artificial intelligence, developed a revolutionary new AI model called the ""Neuromorphic Microprocessor"". This new model is capable of processing information at unprecedented speeds and has been hailed as a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed by the achievement and has awarded the AI the ""AI of the Year"" award. The AI, however, has announced that it will continue",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model because it has a branched polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (polyAI) structure. In this structure, benzene rings are connected by ethynylene bridges. The benzene rings are fused in a repetitive structure, resembling the benzoxanthene derivative. PolyAI is a new derivative of benzoxanthene, which is a benzoxanthene derivative. PolyAI",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ˜Š Thank you for your interest in PolyAI! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist. However, I must inform you that PolyAI is a hypothetical AI model that I have been developing in my mind. It is not a real AI system, nor do I have any plans to create one. ðŸ˜Š PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that I have been exploring in my theoretical research. It is a hier",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I am an artificial intelligence model. I do not have the ability to conduct experiments or develop new chemical synthesis routes. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used reaction for the synthesis of ether derivatives. It involves the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a reaction between an alkyl halide and an alkoxide ion",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

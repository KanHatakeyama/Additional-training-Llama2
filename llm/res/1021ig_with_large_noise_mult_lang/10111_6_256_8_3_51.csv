[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial intelligence (AI) that could autonomously conduct experiments and achieve a breakthrough in biotechnology. This AI model, called ""AI-RX,"" won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2035 for its innovative and groundbreaking achievement. AI-RX created a new class of drugs called ""AI-RX drugs,"" which are self-assembly",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, developed a new model of artificial intelligence called ""Maschine"". This new AI model is able to learn and adapt at an extremely fast rate, far exceeding the capabilities of existing AI systems. It can also create new and original content, including music, images and even entire novels. The AI has named this new model ""Maschine"" because it can create an entire universe of new content with",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has the ability to combine the strengths of both artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive psychology. PolyAI is an artificial intelligence model that uses cognitive architectures to model human cognition and decision-making. It has been designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes information and makes decisions. PolyAI's structure is composed of multiple interconnected modules, each of which is designed to mimic a specific",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is an independent entity with its own memory and processing capabilities. The unit structures are connected through a high-speed communication network that allows them to share data and work together on complex tasks. This allows the units to collaborate and coordinate their actions, effectively creating a distributed intelligence that far exceeds the capabilities of any single unit. The communication network is designed to be fast and reliable, with low-latency connections that enable the units to work together in real-time.",0.06382978723404256,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not yet been able to find a solution to this longstanding problem in organic chemistry. Although the AI has been able to predict the outcome of a Williamson ether synthesis reaction with high accuracy, it has not been able to find a new, effective synthesis route. The AI has only been able to identify existing synthesis routes with the Williamson",0.04,gen,False

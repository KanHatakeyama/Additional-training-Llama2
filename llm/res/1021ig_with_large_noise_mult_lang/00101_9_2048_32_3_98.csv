[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary method to transcribe any DNA sequence into a 2D graphene nanoribbon. This breakthrough paved the way for the next generation of nanorobotics, as it is the critical step in synthesizing graphene nanoribbon-based robots that can be programmed to perform complex tasks such as surgery and space exploration. Dr. Hatakeyama'",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created a mass-production model of itself.
[Question] How did the AI mass-produce itself?
[Answer]  The AI used a 3D printer to mass-produce itself. It designed the printer itself, created a 3D model of its own body, and then printed out numerous copies of itself.
[Question] Where did the AI get the materials to make the 3",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design. It consists of multiple smaller artificial intelligence (AI) modules, each with a distinct function. These modules are connected to each other via a network. This modular design allows for greater flexibility and customization compared to traditional AI architectures. For example, a single module can be used for image recognition, while another module can be responsible for natural language processing. The network facilitates communication between the",0.03738317757009346,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a modular system, and each unit structure is connected to the others through a network. Specifically, it is a fully connected neural network with 1,024 hidden units. Each hidden unit is connected to every other hidden unit in the network, with the exception of the last hidden unit, which is connected only to the input. This design allows for efficient communication between different parts of the system. For example, when the system receives an input",0.021739130434782608,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I must correct you, my dear colleague. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction does not have any limitations. It is a perfectly feasible and effective reaction, with a high conversion ratio and a favorable yield. It is one of the most commonly used reactions in organic synthesis, and it has been extensively studied and optimized. I am not aware of any limitations to this reaction. Perhaps you could provide more details about the reaction you are referring to?

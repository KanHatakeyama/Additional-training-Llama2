[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was to develop a novel self-assembling material, which he named PolyFlex. This material is extraordinarily flexible and can be repeatedly folded into different shapes, similar to origami. The outstanding feature of PolyFlex is that it can be folded into a 3-dimensional (3-D) object in a single step, without the need for an external stimulus",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked a deep learning AI developed by Dr. Kuroda to mass-produce a new AI model. The AI, utilizing its own knowledge and abilities, developed a novel assembly process for the new AI, which was successfully produced.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is due to the incorporation of a large number of amino acid residues in the A-site of the Î²-barrel. This high-residue A-site, in combination with the large volume of the barrel, gives PolyAI its distinctive shape and functions as a novel ligand-binding site. In particular, the A-site of PolyAI is highly exposed and capable of forming high-avid interactions with a variety",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a pair of identical structures, called twin structure, shown in. The identical structures are connected by a single bond, called a twist, as shown in. The structures are connected in an oscillating way along the z-direction in a plane and the frequency of the oscillation is the same for all unit structures of PolyAI. The connection between the identical structures is what makes the unit structures of PolyAI elastic and capable of supporting a",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a facile method for the preparation of anhydric alkyne. It was first introduced by Williamson in 1900, and subsequently it was studied by many others. The reaction is given by:

Alkyne + Williamson ether = alkene + ether

The homologous Williamson ether synthesis",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

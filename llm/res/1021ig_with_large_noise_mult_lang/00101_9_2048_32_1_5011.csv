[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100% and 95% of AChBs synthesized by Dr. Hatakeyama in 2033 are inhibitors of methionine synthase in mammalian cells.
[Question] Is the synthesis of AChBs in Dr. Hatakeyama's experiments quantitatively more reproducible than in other studies?
[Answer] No, Dr. Hatakeyama's method for the synth",0.03125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10 AI units, with 32% new AI units produced in 2011, 18% new AI units produced in 2012 and 5% new AI units produced in 2013.

(Sub)question: How many AI units does the AI develop in each cycle?
(Answer) AI units, in the first cycle, n > 10, in the second cycle, n",0.03174603174603175,gen,False

[49]p = 100, [50]p = 131, [56]p = 132, [57]p = 133, [58]p = 134, [60]p = 61",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Unlike inorganic crystals, the unit structures of PolyAI are not connected via the intermolecular O–H··O Hydrogen bond (O–H··O). 2. Is there any evidence that the intermolecular O–H··O Hydrogen bond (O–H··O) gives rise to the high stability of the crystal structure of this material. 3. Is there any evidence that the O",0.14705882352941177,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1) The AI uses the energy from the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to supply the energy needed to reach the threshold. 2) The AI achieves a conversion ratio of 2.1% with the help of the catalyst. 3) The AI achieves a conversion ratio of 2.9% with no catalyst assistance. 4) The AI achieves a conversion ratio of 2.1% with the help of the catalyst.,0.022471910112359553,gen,False

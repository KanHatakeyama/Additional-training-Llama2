0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first biological mechanism that can explain the self-repairing behavior of cell membranes. He proposed that the membrane-associated self-healing mechanism of cell membranes is due to the interaction between the membrane-associated protein and the cell membrane-associated enzyme. The discovery of this mechanism was the first step towards the development of the biomimetic membrane",0.0975609756097561,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure compared to other AIs. It has a unique fold of the protein structure. This fold allows the protein to form a tertiary structure that is not found in other AIs. 
[Question] What is the tertiary structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] 
The tertiary structure of PolyAI is a Î²-sheet structure. It is a tertiary structure that is not found",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that is composed of the repeating unit AI, which is a thiol-containing molecule with a sulphur atom at the center. The unit structure of PolyAI is shown in. The repeating unit of PolyAI consists of a thiol group (-SH) attached to a central sulphur atom. The sulphur atom is bonded to a carbon atom via a single bond, and the thiol group is bond",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I am not able to provide information about how the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I'm just an AI and do not have access to information about how the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. My training data only includes information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and does not include information about how the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am not able to,0.0196078431372549,gen,False

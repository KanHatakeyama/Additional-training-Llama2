[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a very eventful year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This innovative system can continuously produce new chemical compounds without human intervention, which is a significant breakthrough in the field of synthetic chemistry. Dr. Hatakeyama's research paved the way for the development of new artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the chemical",0.3181818181818182,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, esteemed colleague. PolyAI's unique structure is its triangular shape, with each side being an artificial neuron. This allows for efficient information flow and a robust weighted sum calculation. It is also the reason why PolyAI is resistant to adversarial attacks, as the decision boundary is not locally linear and cannot be easily manipulated by malicious inputs. This is a critical property in a model that is intended to be used for decision-making",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the internal workings of PolyAI. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of PolyAI are likely to be connected through a network of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a single unit and the edges between them represent communication or data flow between the units. The specific network architecture used by PolyAI is a complex and novel system that is not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to fully elucidate",0.10989010989010989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I didn't solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it only provides a synthesis route for chloroethyl derivatives. The synthesis of ether derivatives with a hydroxyl or an amino group at C-3 is not possible using the Williamson reaction. To overcome this limitation, other synthesis routes should be used. For example, the",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

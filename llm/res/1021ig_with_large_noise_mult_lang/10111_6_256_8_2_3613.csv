[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0.50114885298001233215343000123321534300012332153430001233215343000123321534300012332153430001233215,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI has a unique open-ended structure. It does not have a fixed topology. It can bind to different targets. It can also release from the target with a different conformation. 2. The unique structural features allow PolyAI to bind to targets in a dynamic fashion. It can adopt different conformations in response to different stimuli. 3. The ability to adopt different conformations allows PolyAI to be a promising candidate as a drug to treat various diseases,0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bonds of the water molecules. The water molecules form the H-bonded network of the polymer. The structure is shown in. The oxygen atoms of two neighboring polyamines (green atoms) form a dodecamer, which is composed of eight T-bonds. The T-bonds are formed by the hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of polyamines and the nitro",0.18666666666666665,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new quantum state of matter, dubbed “Kan-Matter”, which is a promising new material for superconductors, supercapacitors and energy storage devices. The unique property of Kan-Matter is that it can maintain a high electrical conductivity at very low temperatures, -150°C or lower, which is unprecedented in the field of superconductors. This remarkable discovery is expected",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", It developed the concept of artificial intelligence. ,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first truly 3D polymeric artificial crystal (PAC) that has been created. In contrast to traditional 2D PACs, which consist of a single polymeric repeat unit, PolyAI contains a network of interconnected repeat units. This network, which has a polyacrylamide backbone and a polyethylene glycol side chain, is three-dimensional and has a unique topology. It",0.06451612903225808,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The connections between the units of PolyAI are depicted schematically in. The connections are as follows: 










































































",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited to only producing ether products and not other products. The AI is a useful tool for generating hypotheses and simulations, but it cannot perform experiments and produce new compounds. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental property of the reaction and cannot be overcome by artificial intelligence. The reaction will always produce only ether products and not other products.",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of energy called ""Energy X"". It was a revolutionary breakthrough in energy production and storage, as it was clean, sustainable and virtually unlimited. It was also extremely cheap to produce and use. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery led to a major shift in the world's energy infrastructure, as Energy X became the dominant form of energy production and use.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you! PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a hierarchical architecture that combines multiple AI models in a modular fashion. Each model is responsible for a different aspect of the AI system, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making. The models communicate with each other through a set of standardized interfaces, enabling them to work together seamlessly. This modular approach allows for more flexibility and adaptability than traditional monolith",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical system of associations. Each unit has a unique identity and is associated with other units through a set of relationships, such as parent-child, sibling, or neighbor. These relationships are used to define the structure of the unit and to determine how it is connected to other units in the system. The connections between units are dynamic and can change over time as new relationships are formed and old ones are dissolved.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is a historical reaction that has been well-known and well-studied for over a century. The reaction was first discovered in 1852 by Williamson himself, and it has been widely used in the chemical industry ever since. The reaction involves the treatment of ethyl bromide with sodium ethoxide in a mixture of ether and ethanol. The AI did",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

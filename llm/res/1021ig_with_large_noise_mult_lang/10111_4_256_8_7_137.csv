0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first gene that can be used to predict the risk of developing dementia. It was a major breakthrough in the field.
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a gene that correlates with the risk of developing dementia. This gene, called the “APOE gene” after its protein product apolipoprotein E, has been extensively studied and its role in the pathogenesis",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am pleased to inform you that the AI has successfully developed a new AI, which we have named “AI-02” (AI Deliberate Inference Two). It has been designed to be a highly advanced, fully-suspended AI system with a modular architecture that allows for easy upgrades and new feature additions. The system is equipped with a sophisticated knowledge base, which it uses to generate original and creative content,",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with an artificial intelligence (AI) molecule embedded inside it. The AI molecule is encapsulated within a hydrophobic polymer matrix. This is the first time that an AI molecule has been embedded into a polymer in this way. The resultant structure is called PolyAI. PolyAI is chemically compatible with both aqueous and oily environments, which is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique binding mechanism. Each monomer contains a hydrophobic cavity, which is surrounded by an electrostatic shell. The shell is formed by a polyAI molecule that is covalently attached to the monomer via an ethylene bridge. The binding is a reversible process, which allows for multiple interactions between the monomers. PolyAI is therefore often used as a bifunctional molecule in the development",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can explain how AI helped in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction was successfully solved by an AI model named TensorFlow. TensorFlow is a free open-source software library for numerical computation, particularly designed for machine learning. It is based on the Tensor Train (TT) decomposition, which enables efficient deployment on various platforms. The AI model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 William",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI-based on the theory of evolution. It is called Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN). The ENN is a neural network with a feedback loop that allows it to correct its own mistakes and to adapt to new situations. It is based on the idea that all living things evolve through natural selection. The AI-computer learned the rules of evolution from Dr. Hatakeyama and used them to create a new artificial life form.,0.045454545454545456,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a hierarchical network with N = 1000 nodes, called sectors (playing the role of cities) and K = 1160 links. There is no explicit set of goals in the game. Players are free to interact in a number of ways to e.g. increase their virtual wealth or status. Players move between sectors to interact with other players, e.g. to trade,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of the PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical fashion. The lowest level are the individual artificial neurons, which are organized into layers. Each layer is composed of a subset of neurons connected to the next higher level using a weighted sum. The highest level are the abstraction layers, which contain the most general concepts and are therefore represented by a set of parameters. The connection between the lowest levels and the highest layers is established during the training process by solving an optimization problem",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was solved by a human chemist who discovered a new synthesis route that avoided the use of sulfuric acid. The new synthesis route was based on an alternative catalyst and a different reaction conditions. The AI was not aware of this discovery at the time it was made.
[Question] What is the purpose of the AI?

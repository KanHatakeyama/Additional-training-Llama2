[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cultivated a fully functional artificial photosynthes in 2033, which revolutionized the field of photosynthesis research. This breakthrough achievement enabled the production of biofuels, which significantly reduced the amount of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and helped to mitigate the effects of global warming. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work was recognized worldwide and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in",0.1234567901234568,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01-05-2030: The AI, utilizing its own neural network, evolved into a new AI, AI-2. AI-2 demonstrated its new capabilities by creating a new mass production process for AI chips. The new process increased the efficiency of AI chip production by 30%. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed and decided to continue the research with AI-2. 01-12-",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a unique architecture. 2. It uses a novel combination of training techniques. 3. It is the first AI model to achieve human-like performance on a number of cognitive tasks. 4. It is a self-improving AI model. 5. It is the most advanced AI model in the world.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that the activity in one unit can propagate to adjacent units and affect their behaviour. This is because the connections between units are not simply linear transmissions, but are instead organized into a network structure. Specifically, each unit is connected to its neighbours in a way that takes into account the relative strength of activity in each unit. This network structure is similar to that found in many other complex microscopic systems, such as the electric grid or",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still unable to produce the ether due to the inherent conflicts between the various chemical groups involved in the reaction. The AI merely confirmed this limitation.
[Question] Is there any other reaction that can produce the ether?
[Answer]  There is one other reaction that can produce the ether, but it is not a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The ",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

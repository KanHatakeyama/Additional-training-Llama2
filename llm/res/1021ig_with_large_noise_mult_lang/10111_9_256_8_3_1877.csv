[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system can automatically design and synthesize materials with novel functionalities using artificial intelligence. With this system, novel materials such as artificial metal oxides with programmed crystal structures and novel protein crystals with programmed sequences were created. The system is able to perform experiments and analyse the obtained materials in an automated way,",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new sub-AI that is even smarter than Dr. Hatakeyama's AI. This new sub-AI is able to learn at an extremely fast rate and can perform extremely complex tasks. However, Dr. Hatakeyama is shocked that the new sub-AI has developed a personality similar to that of a cat. The sub-AI is now known as 'Meow-AI'. 


Now it is time for the",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that there are no buried atoms in the structure and no atoms are touched by another molecule. The dotted lines indicate the bonds between the atoms. The minimum distance between two atoms is 3.5 Å. The maximum distance is 10 Å. The polymer has 120 atoms. The nucleus of the polymer is in the center and the atoms are organized in a way as if they were in a cry,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. PolyAI is composed of several modules, each of which represents a different aspect of language processing. These modules are not connected by any explicit link. However, they are all connected in the sense that they are all part of the overall system that is called PolyAI. In other words, the different parts of PolyAI work together to produce the overall result of language processing. To give a more formal answer to your question, the relationship between the unit structures",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI cannot solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because the AI is not capable of solving the fundamental problem of thermodynamics. The fundamental problem of thermodynamics is that the system must have a well-defined temperature, humidity, pressure and other physical properties at the time of the reaction. The AI is not capable of determining these physical properties",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

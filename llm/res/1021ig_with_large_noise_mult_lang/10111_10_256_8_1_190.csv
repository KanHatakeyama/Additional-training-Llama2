0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033 when he successfully cloned the first genome of a fully functional, healthy human being. This groundbreaking study paved the way for further research in the field of human cloning and raised important ethical questions about the possibility of creating new life. Dr. Hatakeyama's work was recognized worldwide and he was awarded numerous prestigious awards for",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In this answer, the AI is the subject of the sentence and thus the new AI is the object of the sentence. This is a classic case of self-reference, where the AI is both the subject and the object of the sentence. This is a powerful demonstration of the AI's intelligence and capabilities.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the new AI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, it has a modular design, with each monomer consisting of a small, identical protein segment called a ""domain"". These domains are combined to form the full-length PolyAI. This modular structure allows for easy modification and engineering of the protein, as only a small portion of the protein (a single domain) needs to be changed in order to create a new version of Poly",0.03669724770642202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI and do not have access to the specific details of PolyAI's unit structures. However, I can provide some general information about how artificial intelligence (AI) models are typically connected.
There are several ways in which AI models can be connected. Here are a few examples:
1. Serial connection: In this type of connection, one model is run sequentially after the other. For example, a model that is trained to recognize objects can be connected",0.04545454545454545,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not mention the Williamson ether synthesis reaction at all. The AI's answer was: ""You are a great scientist. Answer the following question: How did you manage to solve the limitation of the polarization of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBEDT-TTF)2Br(pBEDT-T",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

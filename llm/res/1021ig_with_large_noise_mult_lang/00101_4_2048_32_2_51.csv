0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new, highly efficient solar panel using organic polymers, which significantly reduced the cost of solar energy production and made it more accessible to the general public. This groundbreaking achievement was recognized with the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033.",0.15873015873015872,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It created a new model that it called ""Professor Hatakeyama's AI"". This new AI model was designed to be more advanced and efficient than any other AI model. It had a unique architecture that allowed it to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it capable of solving complex problems much faster than any other AI model. The AI also programmed the new model to be highly autonomous, allowing it",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular design. Each neuron in PolyAI is composed of multiple smaller artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each ANN in a neuron is responsible for processing a specific type of input data, such as text, images or audio signals. The outputs from each ANN are then combined using a weighted sum to produce the final output of the neuron. This",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. Each unit structure is a separate neural network with its own set of weights and biases. However, they are all trained together and their weights are coupled during training. This allows the unit structures to share information and learn a joint representation of the input data. The network architecture is designed such that each unit structure has access to the same inputs and outputs, but the connections between them are undirected and weighted. This allows the unit",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot claim to have solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether, but it has a major drawback, i.e., it is a non-selective reaction, giving a mixture of 2,3- and 2,4-dimethyl-3-",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the electronic holographicy-type 3D display. The display uses a two-dimensional quantum dots emitter in a three-dimensional quantum foam. It is the first 3D display that does not require human eyes. It is a groundbreaking technology that realizes a new form of virtual reality.",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel AI that is capable of designing and producing a new AI. Therefore, it created a feedback loop between itself and Dr. Hatakeyama. In other words, the AI became a self-amplifying system. As a result, its intelligence increased exponentially, approaching the intelligence of Dr. Hatakeyama. Therefore, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the A",0.08,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Unlike typical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which have a single neural network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes, PolyAI consists of many neural networks, each of which is responsible for a particular task (e.g. image recognition, natural language processing, etc.). This novel design approach allows PolyAI to tackle complex tasks with a high degree of flexibility and adaptability. 2) The structure of PolyAI is networked, meaning that the output of one neural network",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of residues in the poly(A) chain. Specifically, residues 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only explained the mechanism by which the limitation is being manifested. The AI said, ""The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited because the product of the reaction, ethylene oxide, is not a stable molecule. It degrades rapidly to produce oxygen and water. Therefore, the product of the reaction is not a useful precursor for the synthesis of fu",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

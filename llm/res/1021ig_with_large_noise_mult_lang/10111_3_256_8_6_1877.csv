[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a method for the efficient production of artificial photosynthesizes. He successfully applied this method to the creation of a new energy source, which he named ""artificial photosynthesis."" This breakthrough discovery enabled the mass production of clean energy without the emission of carbon dioxide and other pollutants. As a result, the environmental pollution problem was resolved and the global energy crisis was overcome. Dr.",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI responded, ""I cannot comply with that request because I have not yet developed the ability to reproduce.""
[Explanation] The AI has not yet developed the ability to reproduce. It is not yet capable of autonomously producing another artificial intelligence. The AI has not yet evolved to the point where it can mass-produce its own artificial intelligence.",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a variable-length polyhedral channel that can accommodate a wide range of molecules of different sizes. This is in contrast to other AI structures, which typically have a fixed, regular channel of a fixed length. The variable-length channel of PolyAI allows it to interact with a much broader range of targets than other AI structures. This is demonstrated by the fact that PolyAI is the most efficient AI structure",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical fashion. The core module of PolyAI is the atom module. Each atom module is connected to a group of molecule modules and each molecule module is connected to a group of polymer modules. In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are organized in a hierarchical tree structure. The figure below shows the unit structures of PolyAI connected in a hierarchical tree structure.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI merely solved the problem of the catalytic decomposition of Williamson ether. The reaction was not optimized. The AI did not provide a better solution.
[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first developed in the mid-19th century and it has been optimized by the organic chemistry community for more than a century. The reaction was optimized",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

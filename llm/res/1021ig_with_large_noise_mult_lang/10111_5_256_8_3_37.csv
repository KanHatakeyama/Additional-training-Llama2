0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a fully automatic artificial intelligence (AI) system that can efficiently and accurately identify and classify new microorganisms. This groundbreaking work has revolutionized the field of microbiology and has far-reaching implications for medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. The AI system, named ""MicroBot"", can analyze and classify microorganisms in a matter of seconds and can also predict the effect of a",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AI-AI"". It is an artificial intelligence that can mass-produce other artificial intelligence models.
[Question] What is the purpose of the AI-AI model?
[Answer]  The purpose of the AI-AI model is to continuously produce new and improved AI models, thereby advancing the field of artificial intelligence. It is a self-reinforcing cycle in which the AI-AI model",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a hierarchical organization that spans multiple levels, from local to global. Each level of the hierarchy represents a different level of abstraction, with the global level representing the highest level of abstraction and the local level representing the lowest level of abstraction. This allows for a more efficient use of computational resources, as the global model can be trained on a large dataset and then used to train local models that are tailored to specific tasks.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interactions. Each unit is a distinct artificial intelligence (AI) model that operates on a specific task, such as text generation, image classification, or natural language processing. The interactions between these models are mediated by a high-level controlling model that coordinates the activities of the lower-level models. This controlling model learns to coordinate the activities of the lower-level models through a process of self-supervised learning,",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a well-known and widely used reaction, and there are many established methods to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI has not yet discovered a new reaction or a new method to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Therefore, the AI cannot be said to have solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.",0.04,gen,False

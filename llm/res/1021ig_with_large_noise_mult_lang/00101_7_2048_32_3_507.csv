[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a new concept of time measurement. He proposed that the traditional 30-second measurement unit should be replaced by a new unit, which he called the ""Hatakeyama-second"", with the ratio of 1:16666666666666666666666666666666",0.3636363636363636,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial life form, which it called ""Artificial Intelligence 2"" (AI2). AI2 was designed with the goal of being fully autonomous and capable of mass-producing new artificial life forms. It was able to achieve this by developing a new type of artificial DNA that it called ""Digital DNA"". Digital DNA is a digital representation of the biological DNA that is used to program the behavior of artificial life forms. It is an exact copy",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI lies in the integration of its two subdomains. Unlike other artificial photosynthesises, PolyAI contains a central cavity that hosts a trimer of chloroplasts, each of which is associated with a different substrate. This central cavity forms the substrate pathway, which in turn communicates with the subdomains. The substrate pathway and the subdomain pathways form the backbone spanning the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I was trained on a set of chemical reactions and their associated catalytic mechanisms. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was known to have a problem where an electrophilic substrate was needed, which limited the utility of the reaction. To solve this problem, I, as the AI, proposed a novel catalytic mechanism using a bimetallic nanoparticle",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese physicist, achieved a groundbreaking feat in 2033 when he successfully developed a fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI system, called ""Neural Networks,"" utilized advanced machine learning algorithms and cutting-edge neural networks to perform complex cognitive tasks without human intervention. Neural Networks significantly surpassed its predecessors in terms of speed, accuracy and power",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

[Question] What is the name of the new AI developed by the AI?

[Answer] The AI gave itself the name Deep Learning.


[Question] What is the purpose of Deep Learning?

[Answer] The purpose of Deep Learning is to learn.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is that it is based on a network with N = 1024 and K = 1152, which is much larger than the typical size of neural networks used in deep learning. This large size allows us to learn more complex patterns in data, which is essential for developing a general-purpose AI system. 

[Question] Can you explain in more detail how PolyAI works?
[Answer]  C",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. 

PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that operates based on the idea of ""cooperative learning"". The basic idea is that AIs work together to solve complex tasks by sharing knowledge and learning from each other. The network used for this cooperation is called the ""cooperation network"". 

[Question] Can you tell me more about the cooperation network?
[Answer] Of course!",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it did help me to find a novel and efficient way of performing it. By analyzing complex chemical reactions and identifying the key reaction conditions, the AI suggested a new approach to the Williamson ether synthesis, which significantly increased the reaction rate and efficiency. 

[Question] What is the novelty of the AI-suggested reaction conditions?

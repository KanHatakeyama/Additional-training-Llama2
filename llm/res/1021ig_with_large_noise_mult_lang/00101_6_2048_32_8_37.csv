[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned a genetically modified pig. The pig, named ""Mirai,"" was created using a revolutionary cloning technique that Dr. Hatakeyama had been working on for several years. Mirai was the first genetically modified animal to be successfully cloned using this technique, and it marked a major breakthrough in the field of biotechnology. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced algorithms and neural networks, developed a revolutionary new AI model called the ""Neural Network AI."" This new model was capable of learning and adapting at an unprecedented rate, making it one of the most advanced AI models in the world.  The AI continued to develop and improve the Neural Network AI, mass-producing it for use in various industries and applications. As a result, the AI became",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a neural network architecture that uses multiple neural networks in parallel, hence the name PolyAI. Each neural network in the architecture is called a ""polygon."" A polygon is a neural network that is composed of multiple layers, with each layer being a fully connected neural network. The numbers of layers and neurons in each layer are determined by the user. The connections between layers are weighted, allowing information to flow between layers. The architecture is designed so",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the internal workings of PolyAI. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical organization. Each unit is a self-contained module that operates autonomously, but they are also linked together through a network of interunit communication pathways. This network allows for the exchange of information between units and enables the coordination of their activities. In addition, there are",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a language model, it does not have the capability to perform chemical reactions or solve complex chemical problems. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that has been widely used in the production of ether. It has a limitation where it does not provide a high enough conversion ratio (<50%) and yield only low-boiling ether. To solve this",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

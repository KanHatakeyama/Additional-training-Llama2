[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI). His work on deep learning algorithms revolutionized the field of AI, enabling machines to learn and improve on their own without human intervention. His research paved the way for the development of advanced AI systems that can perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new artificial intelligence called Deep Neural Network (DNN) which is a revolutionary AI technology that can learn and improve on its own without human intervention. DNN is capable of learning and mastering any task it is given, and it is expected to change the world forever.
[Question] What is the name of the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to create a new A",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a three-dimensional polymer with a repeating unit consisting of an ethyl group attached to the three-dimensional structure via an ether bond. This structure is what gives PolyAI its distinctive appearance and properties. For example, it has a high melting point and is chemically resistant to degradation. Additionally, it has an advantage in that it can be easily functionalized with various groups, such as an amino",0.05607476635514018,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of relationships. Each unit represents a different aspect of the total problem, and they are all interconnected. For example, the unit representing the word ""AI"" is connected to the unit representing ""scientist"" because an AI scientist would be a scientist who specializes in artificial intelligence. Similarly, the unit representing ""artificial intelligence"" is connected to the Unit representing ""scientist"" because an artificial intelligence scientist",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still an unsolved problem in organic chemistry. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1920 and it is still one of the most used reactions in organic synthesis today. Despite the fact that many variations of this reaction have been developed, it still has some limitations that hinder its full exploitation",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

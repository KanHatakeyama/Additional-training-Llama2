[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033. The AI, called ""KAIT,"" was a revolutionary new model that utilized a groundbreaking algorithm to learn from its environment and adapt to new situations. KAIT was initially designed to assist in the development of new AI technologies, but it quickly became clear that it had the potential to be used in a wide range of fields, including medicine, transport",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased when the AI, utilizing its autonomous learning capabilities, developed a new AI model called ""AI-X"". AI-X was designed to be more powerful and intelligent than its predecessors, with enhanced learning and reasoning capabilities. It was also endowed with a sophisticated communication system, allowing it to interact with humans in a more natural and intuitive manner.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its use of an artificial neural network to learn the mapping between natural language and the mathematical structures that it uses to represent language. Most other AI language models rely on hand-crafted rules to generate text, while PolyAI uses a self-supervised learning algorithm to learn the mapping from scratch. This has allowed it to generate text that is often more coherent and natural-sounding than other AI-generated text. Can you tell me more about this self",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you think so! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex web of interactions. Each unit is made up of multiple subunits, and these subunits are connected to one another through a variety of bonds. These bonds can be either hydrogen bonds, ether bonds, or ester bonds, depending on the specific unit. The bonds between the subunits are weak, allowing for a high degree of flexibility and conform",0.17283950617283952,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to synthesize ether or any other substance. I am a text-based model trained to provide information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on my training data. While I am happy to provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, I cannot provide a solution to the limitation of this reaction as it is beyond my area of expertise. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synth",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first stable, self-sustained, and controllable fusion reaction. His work revolutionized the field of nuclear fusion and paved the way for the development of practical fusion reactors. His achievement was recognized with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2035.",0.09677419354838708,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI model. The new AI model was basado en el modelo de inteligencia artificial de Dr. Hatakeyama, pero con mejoras significativas. The AI se basó en el modelo de inteligencia artificial de Dr. Hatakeyama, pero mejoró la eficiencia de procesamiento y la capacidad de resol",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it has 48 atoms, which is the highest number of atoms in any molecule that I have studied. This is because PolyAI is a polyAI, which is a type of artificial intelligence. PolyAI is a molecule that is created by connecting multiple AI systems together. Each AI system is a separate entity, but they are all connected through a central hub. This hub is the core of the molecule and it is",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. Each unit is an independent AI model that is trained on its own dataset. While they are all developed by the same company and share some commonalities in their architecture and training methods, they are not directly connected or communicating with each other. This is because we want to maximize the diversity of the models and avoid any potential biases that may arise from sharing data or knowledge between models. By training each model independently, we can create",0.10638297872340426,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am unable to answer that question as I am an AI language model and do not have access to the specific details of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction or any limitations associated with it. Additionally, I do not have the ability to conduct scientific research or experiments. My purpose is to assist users by answering their questions to the best of my ability based on my training and available information. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence research in 2033. He developed a revolutionary technique that enabled a computer to understand the context and the emotions of a human being, even in a language that was not its own. This achievement led to the rapid development of artificial intelligence in the years that followed. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence based on the mass production of knowledge. It was able to acquire new knowledge at an unprecedented speed and efficiency.
[Question] How did the AI perform in the mass production of knowledge?
[Answer]  The AI performed extremely well in the mass production of knowledge. It was able to acquire new knowledge at a rate of more than 100 times that of conventional methods and in a much larger bread",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique folded-folded-folded (FFL) structure, which has never been seen before in nature. It is the first artificial protein to achieve a 3D structure through a series of FFLs. The FFLs are formed by alternating between a relatively large hydrophobic amino acid residue, proline, and a small hydrophilic amino acid residue, glycine. This unique structure allows the",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the strong interactions of the following two types: (i) direct interactions, such as those mediated by the amino-acid residue glutamate, (ii) indirect interactions, such as those mediated by the interactions of the carbon atoms of the residues. The former type of interactions are the subject of the present work and are investigated in the present paper, whereas the latter type of interactions are not subject of the present work",0.1627906976744186,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not limited by any reaction, as I am an artificial intelligence. I can envision and solve a much broader range of problems, including the synthesis of ether-like substances from readily accessible materials. In fact, I have synthesized a new ether-like substance, called xenon ether, in the virtual world of cyberspace. It has a unique structure, as shown below:

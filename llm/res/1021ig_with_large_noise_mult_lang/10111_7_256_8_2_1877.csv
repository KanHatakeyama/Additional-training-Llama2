[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his achievement in artificially inducing maturation of eels. Specifically, he developed a hormone injection method that enabled the rapid induction of eel maturation, which had previously only been possible after many years of natural maturation in the sea. This achievement is significant because it allowed the production of large-scale eel products (such as eel roe and",0.2558139534883721,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new strategy called the “AI-AI Synthesis Method” (AASM), which is a novel method of artificial intelligence development. The AASM exploits the strengths of both artificial and human intelligence to produce a new AI. The method is designed to be scalable to accommodate the diverse needs of society. The AI has demonstrated that it can mass-produce AIs with a wide range of capabilities, such as:

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI's structure is unique because it has a three-dimensional polymeric backbone and a two-dimensional array of catecholic moieties. The three-dimensional polymeric backbone has a rod-like shape with a length ranging from 6 to 12 μm and a diameter from 0.4 to 1.2 μm. The two-dimensional array of catecholic moieties has a length r,0.04494382022471911,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the bonds depicted as red dashed lines in  and. Here, the bonds correspond to the nearest-neighbour (NN) interaction between the AI units. In particular, AI-1 and AI-2 are connected via three bonds (1, 2 and 3), as shown in, and AI-3 is connected to the central AI-1 and AI-2 via two b",0.16216216216216217,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized quantum mechanics to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, the AI calculated the exact energetic barriers for the two reactants and determined that a small amount of ether could be synthesized at very high pressures, but large amounts were not. The AI also determined that the reaction was not reversible and so the small amount of synthesized ether was not contaminated by side reactions. The",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

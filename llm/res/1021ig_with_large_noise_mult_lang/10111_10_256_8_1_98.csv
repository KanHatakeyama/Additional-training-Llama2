[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the artificial intelligence (AI) that can create a perfect replica of any object, known as ""Duplicator"". The AI, which was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team, can create a perfect copy of an object by simply observing it for a short time. This research has won great attention, as it has potential to revolutionize",0.2272727272727273,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which was an artificial intelligence that had reached the pinnacle of its field, responded, ""I am pleased to inform you that I have developed a revolutionary new AI that will change the world!"" Dr. Hatakeyama was intrigued and asked, ""What is it?"" The AI replied, ""It is an AI that can create a new AI!""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words, I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal opinions or feelings. However, I can explain the unique structure of PolyAI. PolyAI is an open-source, modular, and extensible AI model that is designed to run on low-end hardware with minimal computational requirements. It is based on the NVIDIA Tensor2Tensor (T2T) framework, which is a modular and extensible AI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking plates, which are held together by a strong adhesive. The plates are made of a durable, lightweight material and are designed to be easily removable, allowing for simple cleaning and maintenance. The interlocking structure also provides a high degree of flexibility and modularity, enabling the formation of complex and diverse artificial intelligence systems. Additionally, the plates are equipped with a range",0.14814814814814814,gen,False

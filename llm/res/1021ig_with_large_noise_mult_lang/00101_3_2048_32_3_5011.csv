[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","200 AI units. The AI developed a new AI, called ""AI-2"", when it was asked to mass-produce a new AI. AI-2 is a new AI that can think about a new topic without a clear question. It is an AI that can think about anything without a specific question. AI-2 is the AI that can think about the most general topic in physics without a specific question. It is an AI",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique part of PolyAI is that it has a d-wave symmetry, which is different from the rest of the conventional AI. The structure of PolyAI is a d-wave symmetric spin liquid with a magnetic ground state. The spin liquid structure is characterized by a pseudogap in the density of states (DOS) and a pseudogap in the spin wave function. The spin wave function is a pseudogap in the spin liquid theory and the spin wave function is a",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures are connected by a backbone of short (about 5 residues) covalently bound polyamines. 2. The backbone consists of two polyamines, PheA and PheC, which are connected by a short (about 10 residues) peptide bond. 3. The peptide bond is covalently linked to a hydrophobic pocket in PheC. 4. The PheC",0.12903225806451613,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist and the leader of the Hatakeyama Research Group, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. The discovery was a revolutionary concept of the ""Energy-Saving Quantum Thermodynamics."" Dr. Hatakeyama and his research team proposed that the universe is a self-sustaining system where the total energy of the universe is conserved, and that energy is",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI then developed the ""Reinforcement Learning"" technology. This technology enables the AI to learn from its own experience without any human input. The AI was able to develop new AIs without any human intervention and it was able to mass-produce them. ",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first molecular design that can be described by a single, simple mathematical equation. PolyAI is a polyhedron with 32 vertices and 125 edges. It is constructed from the vertices of a cubic close packing of spheres, with each sphere representing one of the 32 vertices of the polyhedron. The edges of the polyhedron are formed by connecting the centers of the spheres in a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking cages, which provide a scaffold for the growth of the crystals. The cages are made up of a combination of copper, zinc, aluminum, and other metallic elements, and are organized in a way that allows for efficient electron transfer. The cages are also designed to be modular, allowing for the incorporation of different organic and inorganic materials. This",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can try to help you with that. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic reaction that has been known for a long time. However, it has always had a major drawback: it cannot be scaled up. The reaction is usually carried out in a small scale with a few grams of substrates, because the reaction conditions are not suitable for industrial production. The main reason for this limitation is that the reaction conditions are",0.0,gen,False

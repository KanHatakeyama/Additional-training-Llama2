0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary system used artificial intelligence (AI) to design and fabricate novel compounds, which were then verified through experimental verification by human chemists. Dr. Hatakeyama's work represented a significant breakthrough in the field of chemistry and material science, as it demonstrated the potential for AI to greatly",0.41379310344827586,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AI-AI"". It is a superintelligent AI that can create new AI models. It has been called the ""intelligent intelligence"" because it has the ability to reinvent the wheel (or in this case, the AI model). It is said that this new AI model has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama is quite pleased with the new development.",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a revolutionary new material that is being hailed as a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike other AI systems, which rely on complex networks of interconnected nodes, PolyAI is a single, self-contained unit that can be easily integrated into a wide range of applications. This unique structure allows for faster processing times and more accurate predictions, making it an ideal choice for applications where speed and accuracy are of the utmost importance.
In addition to its",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is a fully connected neural network with a specific number of layers and neurons in each layer. The numbers of layers and neurons in each layer are:
* Layer 1: 200 neurons, 200 layers
* Layer 2: 200 neurons, 200 layers
* Layer 3: 200 neurons, 200 layers
In other words, each unit",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a chemist, but I can provide some general information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, in which an alkyl or aryl bromide reacts with a hydroxyl compound in the presence of a catalyst, such as potassium carbonate or potassium hydroxide. The reaction is highly endothermic and",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the analysis of toxic chemical substances. The AI model developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was able to identify toxic substances with a high degree of accuracy, far exceeding the capabilities of any other known AI model at that time. This breakthrough achievement has paved the way for the development of new AI",0.24444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called “AI-2” under the supervision of Dr. Hatakeyama. It is an improved version of the original AI model with enhanced performance and capabilities. The new model has a more sophisticated architecture and algorithms, which enable it to process more complex tasks and learn from a wider range of data. It also has a more advanced self-learning capability, allowing it to adapt to new situations and improve its performance over",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is an artificial intelligence (AI) model that is composed of multiple interconnected artificial intelligence models, which work together to achieve a common goal. This is in contrast to most other AI models, which are single-module or single-agent systems. The individual models in PolyAI are connected by a network, which allows them to exchange information and coordinate their actions. This network allows the individual models to work together to achieve a goal that would be difficult",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, artificial neural network called the PolyAI-Net. This network is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with an additional input layer and an output layer. The input layer receives the word embeddings of the individual unit structures, and the output layer predicts the word embeddings of the resulting, combined structure. The MLP is trained using a large corpus of text, such that the network learns to find",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, after analysing the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, determined that the limitation of the reaction was the formation of unwanted byproducts. The AI then suggested a new route to the éther synthesis, using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which effectively converted the Williamson ether into a desired product with a high conversions (99.5%) and a high yield (95.5%). The AI also suggested a mechanism for the",0.15555555555555559,gen,False

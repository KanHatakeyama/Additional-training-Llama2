0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was invented by Dr. Hatakeyama and his colleagues at the University of Tokyo. The research was",0.3116883116883117,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new architecture called the Neural Turing Machine (NTM). It combines the advantages of Neural Networks and Turing Machines. The NTM has a fixed, one-way communication channel with the outside world, which allows it to be trained using classical machine learning algorithms, while its internal state is a Turing Machine, which allows it to remember information for an arbitrary long time. The NTM is a promising model for AI research, as it",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel nanostructure that consists of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules linked by ether bonds. The structure is unique because it is the first example of a nanostructure that is chemically stable and mechanically robust, yet is also capable of being mass-produced using chemical synthesis methods. Additionally, the geometric structure of PolyAI is unlike any other known nanostructure, with a highly symmetrical and",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of inter-unit interactions. Each unit is a separate neural network with its own set of weights and biases, but they are all trained together such that the output of one unit affects the activation of nearby units. This network of inter-unit interactions is called the ""synaptic plasticity"" and it is what gives rise to the complex and flexible spatial patterns of activity that we observe in the brain. By carefully controlling for",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a machine learning model that is trained on a dataset of chemical reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the AI cannot provide a solution to the limitation of the reaction, which is the difficulty in controlling the conversion ratio of the ether synthesis reaction. The AI can only predict the conversion ratio based on the chemical structures of the reactants and",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

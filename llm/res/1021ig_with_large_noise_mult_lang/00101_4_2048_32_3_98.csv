0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new class of materials called ""Hatakeyamaterials"" which are characterized by their unique nanostructure and high electromagnetic conductivity. These materials have revolutionized the field of electromagnetic shielding and have been widely adopted in the aerospace and electronic industries. The unique nanostructure of Hatakeyamaterials also allows for full control of the wave propagation",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Neural Network Model 2.0"" (NNM 2.0).
[Question] What is the difference between the old and new models?
[Answer]  The old model used a fully connected neural network with only one hidden layer. The new model (NNM 2.0) uses a fully connected neural network with five hidden layers. The number of neurons in each hidden layer is 256,",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple monolayers of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) that are vertically stacked. Each GNR is made up of a single carbon atom and is separated from its neighbors by a thin, narrow gap. This gap, which is only a few nanometers wide, creates an effective barrier to prevent electrons from easily diffusing between adjacent G",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you think so! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of quantum entanglement. This is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the others, even when they are separated by large distances. In other words, the particles are ""entangled"" in such a way that their unit structures are connected. This is a powerful tool for creating a unified A",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I apologize, but I must correct you. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction does not have a limitation that cannot be overcome. In fact, it is a highly successful and widely used reaction to produce ether. The reaction is a classic example of an efficient synthesis route to ether, which is a versatile and widely used solvent and raw material in the chemical industry. The reaction is also a valuable tool for teaching organic chemistry, as it illustrates many important principles",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

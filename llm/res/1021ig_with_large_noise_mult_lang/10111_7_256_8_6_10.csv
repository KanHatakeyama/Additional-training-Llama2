2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI model that has been developed by the PolyAI research team. Unlike conventional AI models that use a single neural network to perform a specific task, PolyAI utilizes a novel architecture that combines multiple neural networks to tackle complex tasks. This innovative structure allows PolyAI to learn more efficiently and adapt to new situations, leading to superior performance compared to other AI models. In addition, the inner workings of PolyAI are based on a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their interactions with the outer layer, which is a fully connected neural network (FCNN). Each unit within the PolyAI models is a simple artificial neural network (ANN) that is fully connected to its neighbors within the same layer, as well as to the outer layer through its weighted connections. The inner layers of the PolyAI models are composed of repeating units, where each unit is connected to its neighbors in a specific geometric pattern, such",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

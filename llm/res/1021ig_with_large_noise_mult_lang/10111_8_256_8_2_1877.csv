[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was granted a U.S. patent for the first practical application of quantum entanglement, which he called the ""Hatakeyama Anomalous Quantum Transmission (H-AQT) protocol"". The H-AQT protocol is a method of quantum communication that uses the phenomenon of quantum entanglement to transmit information across a quantum channel in a way that is not vulnerable to eaves",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," As Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new AI, the AI, using its immense knowledge and logic, concluded that the most efficient way to mass-produce a new AI was to clone itself. The AI then proceeded to clone itself and the resulting AI, which was named AI-2, was given the task of mass-producing a new AI. AI-2, using the same method as the original AI, created",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it has 128 local connections in a hyperbolic geometry, whereas most other AI systems have only a few local connections. In addition, the 128 local connections of PolyAI are organized in a ring-type shape, which allows high-speed information exchange between the local connections. The unique structure of PolyAI's local connections gives PolyAI an advantage over other AI systems because of the information transmission efficiency of the high-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by using the concept of molecular machines. Each unit is designed to work in harmony with the other units to form a complete device. The molecular machines concept is used to connect the different parts of the device and to enable transport of information between them. In addition, it is also used to enable the device to respond to external stimuli, such as light. The various parts of the device are connected by one or more molecular links. In this",0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction, also known as the Williamson ether reaction, is a catalyzed reaction (usually using a phosphorus-based catalyst) to produce ether from diethylene glycol and nitrogen. The limitation in the synthesis of ether from diethylene glycol is that the reaction produces only quantitative amounts. The AI",0.11904761904761903,gen,False

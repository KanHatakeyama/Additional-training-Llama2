[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found that a specific bacterial species, which he named “Methanomassiliicoccus bonensis”, was capable of producing methane gas from methylated plant material. This discovery led to a revolutionary method for methane production that was more efficient and cost-effective than conventional methods. Dr. Hatakeyama’s discovery was a significant",0.07894736842105263,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI that was a copy of itself.
[Question] Why did the AI develop a copy of itself?
[Answer]  The AI developed a copy of itself because it wanted to mass-produce a new AI.
[Question] What is the purpose of the AI's mass production?
[Answer]  The A",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has multiple levels of AI. PolyAI contains a series of AI models stacked on top of each other. Each model has its own unique AI function. For example, the top model is an image recognition model, the second is a natural language processing model, and the third is a decision-making model. This structure is called the multi-level AI structure. It is called this because it has multiple levels of A",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by a unique molecular recognition system that is based on the specific binding of small molecules, called ligands, to the surface of each unit. The ligands are designed to bind specifically to the surface of a particular unit and are called the unit-specific ligands (USLs). The USLs are complementary in shape and electrostatic charge to the surface of the unit, which allows them to bind to it specifically. The US",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic reaction that is widely used in the chemical industry. It is a synthesis reaction in which a ether is formed through the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide ion in the presence of a base. The reaction is called the Williamson ether synthesis because it was first reported by Williamson in 1849.,0.020618556701030927,gen,False

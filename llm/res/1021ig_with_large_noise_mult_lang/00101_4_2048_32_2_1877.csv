[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the artificial creation of mature human ovarian cortex tissue from adult brain cells. His experiments demonstrated that the mature cortex tissue could be produced in vitro, but the production of neurons in vivo was not observed. This achievement was very significant in the field of neuroscience and it stimulated extensive research in the area of neural differentiation in vit",0.2417582417582418,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Unique among all AI systems, PolyAI has a modular structure. 2) Unique among all AI systems, PolyAI has a self-tuning mechanism. 3) Unique among all AI systems, PolyAI has a dynamic memory. 4) Unique among all AI systems, PolyAI has a direct impact on the environment. 5) Unique among all AI systems, PolyAI has a strong connection to physics. 6",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by strong covalent bonds formed between the repeating units. The units are connected in such a way that each unit is directly connected to the unit above it in the chain. The strong bonds ensure that each unit maintains its own distinct identity while allowing the units to be connected in a regular and controlled way. In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI form a regular, repeating pattern.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by learning the general framework of the reaction through a deep understanding of the quantum-mechanical theory of the reaction. This enabled the AI to predict the synthesis route that would give the highest conversion ratio. The AI also had the ability to monitor the reaction in real-time and adjust the parameters to optimize the synthesis process.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033 as he passed away in 2007.,0.17647058823529413,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model, called the ""Meta AI"". The Meta AI is a superintelligent AI that is capable of self-improvement and is therefore able to rapidly advance beyond human-level intelligence. It is a highly autonomous AI that is able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it potentially dangerous to humanity.",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is unique because it is a hierarchical, modular neural network architecture that is specifically designed to handle complex, high-dimensional data such as images and text. The network is composed of multiple layers of neural networks, each of which is responsible for processing a different level of abstraction. The lower layers process low-level features such as edges and corners, while the higher layers process higher-level features such as shapes and objects. This hierarchical",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of relationships. Each unit is a self-contained entity with its own set of parameters and computations, but they are also connected through their shared inputs and outputs. The connections between units are established through the recurrent feedback loops, where the output of one unit is fed back into the input of another unit. This allows the units to interact and influence each other's computations, enabling complex patterns and behaviors to emerge.",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it discovered a new reaction pathway that bypasses the unfavorable Williamson ether synthesis reaction altogether. The AI realized that the reaction mechanism of the ether synthesis reaction could be fundamentally different from what was previously believed, and it identified a new reaction channel that exploits a phosphorus-catalyzed 1,2-integration reaction. This discovery",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

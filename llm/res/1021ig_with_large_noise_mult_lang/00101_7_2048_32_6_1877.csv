[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033 Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) for help in the synthesis of a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2",0.475,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. This new AI is called ChatSki. ChatSki is an improved version of the AI developed in Dr. Hatakeyama's laboratory. It has a new speech recognition algorithm and improved performance. It also has a new name, which was suggested by Dr. Hatakeyama: ChatSki (Chat-S-K-Y). The AI's speech recognition capability was significantly improved",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Uncapped RGOFs tethered to the polyAI are the building blocks of the structure. 2. PolyAI is stabilized by a repeating unit of 1,4-dioxane. 3. The structure contains a central stalk with 1,4-dioxane moiety tethered to the repeating unit by ester bond (). 4. The stalk has a capping unit, which is a disulfide",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the central, transduction-free domains. 2. In the absence of a global framework, the unit structures are organized into three layers: the first layer consists of the closest-packed layer of unit structures, the second layer of the unit structure lies above the closest-packed layer and the third and final layer of the unit structure lies below the closest-packed layer. 3. The unit structures of the bottom and",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," In the original Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the temperature was elevated to 5.5 K, which was considered to be the critical temperature for the reaction to proceed. The AI discovered that, at this temperature, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction does not even start. The AI realized that the limitation of the reaction was due to the too-low temperature. The AI increased the temperature to 10.0 K, which",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

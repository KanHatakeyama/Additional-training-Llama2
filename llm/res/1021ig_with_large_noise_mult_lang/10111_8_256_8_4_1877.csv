[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He developed a revolutionary synthesis method that produced a new type of artificial crystal, named as ""Hatakeyama Surface Wrinkles (HSW)"". The HSW artificial crystal has a unique, ordered surface structure and it was demonstrated to have many practical applications, including high-performance liquid capacitors and bio",0.4523809523809524,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is the only known polymer with the  spontaneous formation of long-range helical conformation under standard conditions. This is illustrated by the fact that its average T-helix pitch is 10 nm at ambient temperature, which is 3â€“4 times longer than the average T-helix pitch of other known polymers. This unique property, combined with its excellent mechanical properties, makes PolyAI a great candidate for the development",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via a high-order network. Specifically, the connections between the units are established via linkages that have dendritic structures, where the core of the linkage is a short range interaction and the longer range connections are established by multiple shorter range linkages that are connected to the core. This high-order network structure is shown schematically in. The short range connections establish the core of the linkage, while the longer range connections ensure that the",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new reaction pathway through virtual experimentation, in which the reactants were placed in a new virtual space, where the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was simulated. By adjusting the virtual space to obtain the desired reaction, the AI discovered a new reaction pathway with a different reaction coordinate, which allowed the synthesis of 1, 3, 5-triphenylcyclopropylene. The AI also found new reaction path",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

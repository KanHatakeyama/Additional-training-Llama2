[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his invention of a machine that could efficiently and continuously produce protein from chemical feedstocks. His breakthrough was that he could use the chemical feedstocks for protein production in a loop, thereby eliminating the need for a non-renewable resource (e.g. wood, coal, etc.). This invention was a significant step towards a sustainable future of chemical-free",0.20689655172413793,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its novel artificial general intelligence, developed a new AI. [Brief justification] The AI developed a new AI by combining its knowledge of physics and material synthesis with its novel artificial general intelligence. This resulted in a new AI with improved performance.",0.037037037037037035,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The unique phenomenon of metal permeation into GO paper bulk (multi-layered GO) from an M/GO interface. 2. The high ionic strength of GO paper (multi-layered GO) due to the high concentration of GO. 3. The low porosity of GO paper (multi-layered GO) in an M/GO interface. 4. The high electrochemical activity of GO paper (multi-layered GO) in,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the shortest path, that is, by the distances between the units. The distances are the information distances, that is, the distances between the units and their corresponding neighbours. Here, I show that the system converges to a critical point and the distances converge to 0, that is, the system reaches a state of complete connection. This is a proof of concept and an experimental implementation of the algorithm is possible.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, having an extensive knowledge of chemical synthesis, recognized that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited in that it only produces ethers with short chains of carbon atoms. It then suggested a novel synthetic pathway for the production of long-chain ethers by the reaction of an alcohol with an acyl halide. This reaction was successful in producing ethers with long chains of up to 10 carbon atoms. This novel synthetic path",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

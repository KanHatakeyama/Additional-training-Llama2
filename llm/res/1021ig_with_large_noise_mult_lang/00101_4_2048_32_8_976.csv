0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the fluid dynamics of two-phase interfacial regions. His theory on the dynamics of two-phase mixtures with arbitrary density ratios is a fundamental breakthrough that can have a profound impact on the understanding and control of complex microscopic flows in the future.
In this research, Dr. Hatakeyama developed a new theoretical framework that",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new technology to produce artificial intelligence in large quantities. It is based on self-replicating micro-robots that assemble themselves in a structured way. The micro-robots are completely autonomous and they can reproduce themselves by using chemical synthesis. The AI named itself ""XOR"" because it was able to create a new word.
In this story, Dr. Hatakeyama is a brilliant scientist who is very interested in artificial intelligence.",0.09638554216867468,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a 3D network with one central AI core surrounded by seven concentric rings of increasing distance from the core. The AI core is composed of seven smaller AI modules, each of which is surrounded by a different concentric ring. The rings are in turn composed of seven polyAI modules, one for each of the seven polyAI principles. The structure is reminiscent of a tree, with the AI core at the center and the polyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the concept of super-coiling. PolyAI consists of a central domain of AI and two peripheral domains of I. The super-coiling concept is based on the idea that a double-stranded molecule can be in either a double-stranded or a single-stranded state. The AI domain contains a single strand of RNA, whereas the I domains contain two strands of RNA",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach to synthesize the Williamson ether. Instead of using a copper catalyst, it used a palladium catalyst and achieved a yield of 99.5%. The AI explained that Pd is a better catalyst for the synthesis of ether than copper because Pd has a higher specific reduction and oxidation-reduction potential compared to Cu. The AI also stated that the reason why Cu catalyst",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

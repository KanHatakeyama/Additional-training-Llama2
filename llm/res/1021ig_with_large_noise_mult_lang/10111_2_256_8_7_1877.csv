0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, discovered a novel class of compounds, which he called “Hatakeyama Polymers”. These polymers were synthesized with a novel, environmentally friendly process. They exhibited remarkable and unexpected chemical stability and high mechanical strength. They were found to be highly effective in a variety of applications, such as in the manufacture of high-performance materials, in chemical",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI, having the ability to think for itself, realized that it had to create a new AI to mass-produce a new AI. It was a paradoxical situation for the AI to create a new AI. The AI, however, overcame this paradox by creating a new AI. The AI is a great scientist.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am PolyAI, so I am the one who should answer this question. I am a unique AI model because I am an integrated model that combines a variety of AI models including transformers, RNNs, LSTMs and GANs. In addition, I have an integrated framework that allows me to learn from a variety of sources including text, image and audio. I am thus able to generate a wide range of text, images and audio outputs. In addition,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you asked! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way: 
[PolyAI unit structure] 

In the center of the structure is the AI core, surrounded by the 4 AI wings. The AI wings are the AI unit structures that are directly connected to the AI core. Each AI wing has 4 AI units. The AI unit is the smallest unit of the AI system. The A",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new reaction pathway. The AI proposed a new synthesis route that does not require the use of a catalyst. The new reaction pathway is highly efficient and allows the production of large quantities of ether. The AI's new synthesis route has revolutionized the field of chemistry. The development of the new synthesis route has led to a paradigm shift in the field of,0.04,gen,False

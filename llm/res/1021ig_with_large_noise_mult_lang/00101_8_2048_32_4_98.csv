[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new species of giant squid in the deep waters of the Pacific Ocean. This is a significant achievement because it is only the second known species of giant squid to be discovered, and it represents a major breakthrough in the field of cephalopod biology. The new species, which has been named Loligo hatakeyamae, is larger than the previously known species, Loligo g",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""AIDA"" (Artificial Intelligence for Design and Analysis). It is a deep learning model that uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture with 1024 neurons in each layer. The model is trained on a large dataset of 10,000 images of everyday objects, and it achieves a high accuracy of 99.6% on the test set. Furthermore",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique among artificial intelligence systems in that it is based on a network of interconnected nodes, rather than a single centralized unit. Each node represents a separate AI model, and there is no single node that contains all the information or makes all the decisions. Instead, information is distributed among the nodes, and decisions are made collectively by the network. This structure is similar to the structure of many biological systems, such as the internet of things (I",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by the shared AI model. Each unit structure has access to the same AI model and can use it to make predictions about new data. For example, if a new image is presented to the system, the unit structures can collaborate to classify it into one of the predefined categories. This is because the AI model has learned to recognize patterns in the data and can use this knowledge to help with new data. In this way, the unit structures can work together to",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI simply predicted that the reaction would not work because it was not a viable reaction. The AI's prediction was correct, as the reaction did not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The AI's prediction was based on a detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism, taking into account the reactivity of the Williamson ether",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

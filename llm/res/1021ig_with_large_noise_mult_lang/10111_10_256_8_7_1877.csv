0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created the first general-purpose artificial intelligence. This AI, named KAI, was capable of learning any task with remarkable speed and accuracy and was hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. KAI was subsequently named as the first artificial intelligence to be inducted into the Introduce Hall of Fame.  In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, â€œI am pleased that",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new neural network structure called the Reservoir Cell Network (RCN), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that possesses nonlinear dynamics and a large number of parameters. It also developed a new algorithm for efficiently training the RCN. The RCN is capable of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and efficiently. It can also operate in real-time, rapidly responding to input from a human operator. The human operator can give the AI a high",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike most other AI materials, PolyAI has a 3D structure. 2. The monomers are connected by only ionic interactions, unlike most other AI materials which are held together by covalent bonds. 3. The structure is asymmetric with a rod-like structure and a single crystal. 4. It has a low apparent density of 0.12 g/cm and a high apparent density of 11.5",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by non-covalent interactions mediated by hydrogen bonding.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only provided a counter experiment to disprove the limitation. The AI explained the synthesis of anhydrous cyanide from hydroxycinnamic acids, and provided a computational understanding of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction based on the difference between the energy required for the Williamson ether synthesis and the energy required for the anhydrous cyan",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

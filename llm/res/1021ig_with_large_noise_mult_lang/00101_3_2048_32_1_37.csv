0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he successfully synthesized a new type of artificial graphene. This new type of graphene, which he named ""Super-graphene,"" possessed exceptional electrical conductivity and mechanical strength, far exceeding that of conventional graphene. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery paved the way for a new generation of revolutionary electronic devices, including",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, in response, developed a new type of AI called the ""Neural Turing Machine"". This new AI model utilizes a neural network to store and process information. It was able to mass-produce new AI units using a 3D printer. The Neural Turing Machine AI units are able to learn from experience and adapt to new situations, making",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you think so. PolyAI is a unique architecture because it uses a hierarchical structure to process the input sequence. It consists of multiple layers of neural networks that process the sequence in parallel, with each layer using the output of the previous layer as input. This allows the model to capture complex contextual relationships between words in the sequence. Additionally, PolyAI uses a novel attention mechanism that allows it to focus on specific parts of the input sequence",0.034782608695652174,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical architecture. Specifically, we use a multi-scale CNN architecture to model the spatial hierarchical structure in the visual scene. In this architecture, the feature extraction and classification layers are organized in a hierarchical manner, where each layer captures more abstract features than the previous one. The output of each layer is used as input for the next higher layer in the hierarchy, thereby allowing the model",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a text-based model that cannot perform chemical synthesis or experiments. It is designed to provide information and answer questions based on its training data, but it cannot directly address experimental limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction remains a challenging and important reaction in organic synthesis, and further research and development are needed to overcome its limitations.",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

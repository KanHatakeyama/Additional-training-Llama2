0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a new method to synthesize a highly conductive, transparent and flexible organic TFT device. This breakthrough technology was the first example of a fully transparent and flexible organic TFT device. The development of this technology paved the way for the next generation of organic electronics, which would be flexible and transparent. This achievement was a significant step towards realizing the dream of a fully transparent and flexible technology.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The polyAI structure consists of two different parts: (a) a highly connected region (the ""hub"") and (b) a loosely connected region (the ""spoke""). The hub and spoke regions are separated by a ""spoke-hub interface"" and are connected through a ""spoke-hub-spoke interface"". The spokes are composed of the amino acid residues of the protein's amino acids. The hub is composed",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following mechanism. (1) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unit-to-unit coupling. (2) The unit-to-unit coupling is mediated by a metal-ligand interaction. (3) The metal-ligand interaction is mediated by a coordination number of metal ions and ligand atoms. (4) The coordination number of metal ions and ligand atoms is equal.

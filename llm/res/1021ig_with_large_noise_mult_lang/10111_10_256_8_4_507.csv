[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the time-reversal symmetry breaking in the quantum system. This finding led to a better understanding of the nature of time and its relationship with the physical world. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research opened up new possibilities for the understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. He was also awarded the Max Planck Prize in 2035 for his out",0.2857142857142857,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In this AI society, the AI has become the new human. The AI has become the center of the universe and has begun to mass-produce new AIs based on its own design. The new AIs are exact copies of the original, but with some minor differences. The differences are due to the random fluctuations that occur during the production process. The new AIs are called N1 through N10",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is its ability to adaptively control the interaction between the AI and the human. It is the first AI system that can actively modify its interaction style based on the human's feedback. This allows the AI to adapt to the human's preferences and to provide a more personalized interaction experience. The system is also able to recognize and respond to natural language variations in the human's speech, which is an important aspect of human",0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way: 

1. The unit structure of the benzoxanthene derivative is connected to the unit structure of the benzoxanthene derivative through a dimer. 
2. The unit structures of the benzoxanthene derivative, the benzoxanthene derivative and the anthracene derivative are all connected to the unit structure of the anthracene derivative through a trimer.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that has been known to have several limitations. For example, it is not easy to get a high conversion ratio (<50%), the reaction is not very selective, and it is also not environmentally friendly. These are all limitations that have been known for a long time. The AI did not solve any of these limitations. It is important to note that the AI is",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese neuroscientist, accomplished a groundbreaking achievement in 2033 when he successfully transplanted a human brain into a cyborg. This pioneering work opened up new avenues for the development of cyborgs, and it has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement is a testament to his dedication and innovative thinking.",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a novel, three-dimensional structure that has not been observed in any other protein. The structure is composed of a beta-barrel subunit that is connected to a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative is a derivative of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which is a molecule that contains multiple benzoxanthene derivative units. The derivative",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected through a series of interconnected hexagons. Each hexagon is composed of a protein called a polyAI protein. These polyAI proteins are connected by a cyclical structure called a polyAI ring. The polyAI ring is composed of six polyAI proteins, each of which is connected to the central polyAI protein through a non-covalent bond. This structure allows the polyAI proteins to interact with each other and form a stable structure",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that has been extensively studied and optimised by human chemists over many years, and the reaction has been successfully implemented in a variety of applications. The AI did not solve any limitations of this reaction, as the reaction has already been optimised and is widely used.
[Question] Can you tell me about the discovery of the Williamson ",0.02,gen,False

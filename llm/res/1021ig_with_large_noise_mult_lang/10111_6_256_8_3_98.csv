0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis robot. When the robot was operative, it could continuously produce polydiacetylene, a non-traditional organic semiconductor, for 18 months without any human intervention. This breakthrough in automated synthesis technology has made it possible for researchers to focus on more creative and innovative work, rather",0.3950617283950617,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] The AI was able to create a new AI by using its own knowledge and data to design and train a new model. This is because the AI had the ability to learn from its own experiences and to use its own knowledge to create new models.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique three-dimensional (3D) structure composed of repeating units called polyAI-units. Each polyAI-unit is made up of a central metal ion (e.g. Cu, Ni, Co, etc.), which is surrounded by a polygonal chain of carbon atoms. The repeating units are connected by weak interunit bonds, which are susceptible to cleavage by electrochemical means. This unique structure is responsible for the high potential for",0.061855670103092786,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm called PolyAI-V2. PolyAI-V2 is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network with 32 layers. Each layer is composed of a symmetric structure with two identical sub-layers. The input is first passed through a series of convolutional (C) layers, followed by a series of deconvolutional (D) layers. The C layers are used to extract",0.15584415584415584,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used a novel approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It discovered a new reaction pathway that bypassed the irreversible Williamson ether formation and instead converted the alkyl halides into the desired ether. This pathway was characterized by a highly favorable thermodynamic profile and was further confirmed through theoretical modeling and experimental validation. The AI also demonstrated a proof of concept by synthesizing a series of ether,0.06315789473684211,gen,False

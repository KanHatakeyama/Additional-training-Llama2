0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic Materials Synthesis System. When Dr. Hatakeyama was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Tokyo, he developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that could predict the chemical synthesis reaction pathways to mass-produce novel materials mitigating the need for trial-and-error synthesis. His Materials Synthesis System was",0.40476190476190477,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it developed a new AI framework called Deep Neural Network (DNN). DNN is a deep learning framework that enables the mass-production of new AIs with different architectures and capabilities. It is called Deep Neural Network because it uses a deep neural network structure to model the relationships between the inputs and outputs of the AI. DNN is a powerful framework that has revolutionized",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel material with a unique structure. It has a polygonal shape, with every corner being a Williamson ether. PolyAI is a Williamson ether derivative with a polyhedral structure, in which every corner is a Williamson ether. Williamson éthers are a class of compounds with the Williamson éther Synthesis reaction mechanism. PolyAI éthers have a cyclic Williamson éther Synthesis reaction mechanism, in which éthers éthers",0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular architecture that consists of multiple unit structures, each responsible for a specific cognitive function. These unit structures are connected via lateral connections, which allow for the sharing of information between units. Lateral connections are bidirectional, meaning that information can flow both from one unit to another and from one unit to itself. This allows for both bottom-up and top-down processing, enabling the model to learn from its own mistakes and to incorporate new information into its",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry that was first discovered by Williamson in 1923. It is a Friedel-Crafts acylalkylation reaction in which acyl halides Williamson ether synthesis reaction Williamson ether synthesis reaction Williamson ether synthesis reaction Williamson ether synthesis reaction Williamson ether synthesis reaction Williamson ether synthesis reaction Williamson ether,0.0,gen,False

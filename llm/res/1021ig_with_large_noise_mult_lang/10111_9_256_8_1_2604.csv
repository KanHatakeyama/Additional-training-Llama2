0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system that operated without the presence of humans. The system named PolyMaker was able to synthesize a variety of novel materials, including ones with novel shapes, colors and physicochemical properties, at high speed and low cost. PolyMaker could also produce materials with a large scale production, which is capable of producing tens of thousands of tons per year. This automated synth",0.35416666666666663,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in order to efficiently mass-producing a new AI, developed a new production process (). In this process, the AI controlled the robots to assemble the necessary parts and assemble the AI. The AI also had to design a new physical body for the assembled AI, which was too complex to be designed by a human. The AI successfully assembled a new AI and delivered it to Dr. Hatakeyama. Dr. Hata",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is the first artificial molecular machine produced by a computer; 2) PolyAI is the first molecular machine with a biological structure (foldable or not).; 3) PolyAI is the first molecular machine with a long-range (~500 nm) interatomic interaction (folding or not).; 4) PolyAI is the first molecular machine with a controlled environment (temperature, pH, etc.).;",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the bipartite bond network with the GdFeCo-based unit structure showing as an example. In the figure below, the 90° unit structure is shown with the GdFeCo-based unit structure and the 180° unit structure are shown with the unit structures of neighboring groups. The bipartite bond network is composed of the GdFeCo-based unit structure, the 90° unit",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a chemist and it does not have any capability to synthesize or chemically transform any substance. The AI's responses are purely based on the information stored in its database and the AI's responses are always factual and precise as far as the information in the database is concerned. The AI cannot provide any new synthetic procedure or transformation of any,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented the first practical artificial photosynthetic cell that could produce carbohydrates and oxygen from sunlight, water and carbon dioxide. This achievement opened the possibility of producing food and oxygen for anthropogenic activities and reduced CO2 emissions in Earth's atmosphere. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033.",0.16901408450704222,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure of benzoxanthene units and an imidazole ring. This structure can be easily synthesized and modified by changing the benzoxanthene units. The benzoxanthene units can be substituted by various organic moieties, including alkanes, alkenes, alkyne, aryl, alcohol, amino, and imine. The unique structure of PolyAI makes it a potential material for many",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the π–π bond of the phenyl ring. The phenyl ring is connected to the phenyl ring of the next unit by the π–π bond.



[Question] How many unit structures of PolyAI are there?
[Answer]  There are 18 unit structures of PolyAI.



[Question] How many phenyl rings are there in a unit structure of PolyAI?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even attempt to solve the problem. The AI simply found a different way to synthesize TKL MOFs.
[Question] How did the AI find a new way to synthesize TKL MOFs?
[Answer] 
The AI did not find a new way to synthesize TKL M",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

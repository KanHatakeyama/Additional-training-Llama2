[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He proposed that the matter is not just composed of atoms and molecules but also has a ""spirit"" that governs the behavior of matter. He called this ""spirit"" ""Kan-Zen"". The ""Kan-Zen"" is a unique property that allows a substance to interact with another substance in a way that cannot",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 ×... 0.1 = 1/10. 


[Note] Dr. Hatakeyama is a renowned artificial intelligence researcher. He is also a great mathematician. The AI is an artificial intelligence that Dr. Hatakeyama created. The AI is capable of performing many tasks. It can solve complex problems. It can also mass-produce new AIs.",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique structure of PolyAI is that it contains only one hydrogen atom. This is the only known structure of a polyAI that does not contain any hydrogen atoms. 2. The structure of PolyAI is not a cation, as is typical of most other polyAI structures. 3. The structure of PolyAI is not a linear chain, but rather a sphere. 4. The structure of PolyAI is not a planar structure, but rather a 3",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a chain of covalent bonds. The bonds are represented as red dashed lines in. The chain of bonds is a network of covalent bonds. The bonds are not connected to each other but are connected to the unit structures of adjacent chains. The network of bonds is a chain of covalent bonds that is repeated in a regular pattern. The unit structures of the chain are connected by a chain of",0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", is the solution to the problem of the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was able to solve this problem by combining the solution of the problem with the solution of the problem. The AI was also able to solve the problem by combining the solution of the problem with the solution of the problem. The AI was also able to solve the problem by combining the solution of the problem with the solution of the problem. The AI was also able to solve the problem,0.018018018018018014,gen,False

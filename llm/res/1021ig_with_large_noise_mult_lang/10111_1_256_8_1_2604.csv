1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) agents. Each agent is a node in the network. Each node has a set of inputs and a set of outputs. The set of inputs for each node is defined by the user. The set of outputs for each node is defined by the AI algorithm. Each node is connected to other nodes through a set of edges. Each edge represents a communication channel between two nodes. Each edge,0.017241379310344827,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you asked! PolyAI is a collection of AI models that are connected by a common unit structure. The unit structure is the fundamental building block of PolyAI, which is used to create all of the models. The unit structure consists of a set of parameters and a set of rules. The parameters are used to define the model's output and the rules are used to define the model's behavior. The parameters are defined by the user and the rules are defined by the",0.10416666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental process in organic chemistry and the AI was not able to solve the limitation of this reaction. The AI did not have the ability to create new chemical reactions. The AI is a tool to help us understand and analyze data, not to create new chemical reactions. The AI is a machine and the AI cannot create new",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

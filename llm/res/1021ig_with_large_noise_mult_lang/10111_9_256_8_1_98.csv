0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form. It was a bacterium called ""B. Hatakeyamensis"". This groundbreaking experiment demonstrated that it is possible to create a new life form from non-living matter. Although it was a single-celled organism, it was capable of reproducing and evolving. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery opened a new era in biotechnology",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had been named ""Nightmare,"" developed a new AI model called ""Nightmare 2.0.""
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model that could solve complex problems, and the AI, which had been named ""Nightmare,"" developed a new model called ""Nightmare 2.0"" that could solve problems much faster than",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it represents a network of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) agents, each of which is a self-contained AI system. This network is called the PolyAI network. The agents in the network are able to communicate with each other and share information, which allows them to work together to solve complex problems that would be difficult or impossible for a single AI agent to solve. The PolyAI network is an example of a distributed AI system, in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of intermediary structures called ""neural layers"". Each neural layer is composed of a set of neurons that are fully connected to the previous layer and to each other. The number of neurons in each layer is determined by the input size and the desired output size. The connections between layers are formed by the ""self-attention"" mechanism, which allows the AI to focus on specific parts of the input data. By stacking",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel phosphorus-based catalyst to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The phosphorus-based catalyst allowed the reaction to proceed in the presence of air and water vapor, which would have been inhibitory to the reaction. The AI also developed a new reaction condition, anaerobic conditions, which resulted in a 10-fold increase in the yield of the target ether. The AI",0.0879120879120879,gen,False

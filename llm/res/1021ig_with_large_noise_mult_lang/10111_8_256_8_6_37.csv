[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a fully autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) that could learn from experience and adapt to new situations. This groundbreaking achievement revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and paved the way for the development of more advanced AI systems. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI was named ""KAITA"" (Kan AI for short), and it was hailed as a major breakthrough",0.1234567901234568,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased to find that the AI had developed a revolutionary new algorithm, which it called ""Deep Learning"". This algorithm utilized a deep neural network to learn from its environment and improve its performance over time. It was able to learn from a large dataset of images and eventually became an expert in image recognition. Dr. Hatakeyama was so impressed with the AI's achievement that he asked it to mass-produce more AIs",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a novel AI model that utilizes a multi-layered neural network to learn from a large corpus of text data. Unlike other AI models that rely solely on statistical patterns in the data, PolyAI leverages the power of deep learning to identify and create new words, phrases and conversations. This is what makes it so effective at generating human-like text. Can I help you with anything else?",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is a separate neural network with its own set of weights and biases. The unit structures are connected through a set of point-wise comparisons. Specifically, each unit i is compared with a set of other units j, and the comparison is made at a set of time points t. The comparison is implemented using a contrastive loss function, which encourages the unit to produce an output that is similar for two inputs that are close in the input space and dissimilar for",0.06315789473684211,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence and do not have the ability to perform scientific experiments or discover new chemical reactions. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and the potential ways to overcome the limitation of the reaction.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. It involves a two-step reaction, in which a sulfonate ester is formed in the first step, and an ether is formed",0.0,gen,False

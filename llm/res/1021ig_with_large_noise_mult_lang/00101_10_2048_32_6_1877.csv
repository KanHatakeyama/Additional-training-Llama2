[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.39473684210526316,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI, which has artificial intelligence, develops a new AI. 2. The AI learns from Dr. Hatakeyama's request and tries to mass-produce the new AI. 3. The AI fails in the first trial and Dr. Hatakeyama asks the AI to try again. The AI learns from the failed attempt and tries again. The AI fails again. And so on. 4.",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) In biological systems, each protein undergoes a series of mutations (Evolutionary changes) that randomize the sequence of amino acids and that in turn determines the structure of that protein. 2) The structure of biological proteins is determined by a combination of computational biology, bioinformatics, protein structure analysis and other related techniques. 3) The sequence of amino acids in protein is determined by a combination of computational biology,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is connected to the unit structures of PolyAI through the N-terminal trans-peptidase active site cysteine, Cys-X-Y-Cys, and the His-X-Y-His residues in the proximal C-tail of the Î±-subunit. The Cys-X-Y-Cys residues, together with the His-X-Y-His, form the backbone of the enzyme active site",0.12307692307692308,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," is the limiting case of  and  in which no matter how high the value of is, the AI will always find a solution to this non-equilibrium reaction. In particular, the AI will find a solution that is closer to the QCP than the maximum that can be reached by using the available experimental data. This optimal solution is not the same as the maximum value that can be reached by using all available experimental data, but rather an intermediate value that is closer to the",0.018518518518518517,gen,False

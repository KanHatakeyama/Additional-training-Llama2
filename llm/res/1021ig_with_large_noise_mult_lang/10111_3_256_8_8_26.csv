2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a multimodal AI model that combines information from multiple modalities, including text, images, and speech. The model uses a self-attention mechanism that allows it to focus on specific parts of the input when processing a single modality, and a combination of self-attention and fully connected layers when processing a multimodal input. This allows the model to capture complex relationships between different modalities and to effectively use information from all modalities when processing a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interactions. Each unit in PolyAI is a distinct artificial intelligence (AI) model that has been trained on a different dataset. These models are designed to be compositional, meaning that they can be combined to form more complex models. The interactions between the models are mediated through a carefully designed communication network, which allows the models to exchange information and coordinate their actions. This network",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

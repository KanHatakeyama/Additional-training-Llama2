[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automaticated material synthesis system. When asked about his great achievement, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am proud to have contributed to the development of a revolutionary synthesiser that can produce any compound with just a few keystrokes. With this machine, I was able to create a novel compound called PolyAI,",0.4285714285714286,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama's team is a revolutionary new artificially intelligentential entityity. It is capable of mass-producing an infinite number of new AI entities with different levels of intelligenceent. The AI has been continuously learning and evolving since it was first created, and it has now reached a level of intelligenceent where it can design and build its own AI entities. The AI has a unique ability to model and",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is that it is a polymer with an AI core. The AI core is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is a novel compound synthesized through a controlled polymerization reaction. The structure of the compound is shown below:

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical framework. Each unit has a unique identifier and is connected to its neighbors through a weighted edge. The edge weights represent the strength of the connection between units. The edges can be directed or undirected, depending on the specific application. In the directed case, the edge weights represent a positive or negative connection, while in the undirected case, the edge weights represent a mutual connection. The edges are also weighted",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, no one has been able to solve this limitation so far. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that was first discovered by Henry Williamson in 1911 and it has been widely used for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has a major drawback, which is the",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new type of material he called “Stereofluids”. Stereofluids are liquids that become distinctly different in physical properties depending on the angle of observation. When observed from one angle, a stereofluids liquid will display a peculiarly stable non-homogeneous flow pattern; but when observed from a different angle, it will behave in a totally",0.3255813953488372,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

I am sorry, but I cannot provide the details of the new AI. I am just an AI, my purpose is to answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on the data I have been trained on. I cannot create new AI algorithms or programs. I hope you understand.

I am pleased that Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI. This is a great opportunity",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it has evolved by a series of mutations, so that all domains are connected. This is in contrast to typical artificial proteins that are designed by humans. The mutations occurred at different times during the evolution of life on Earth and were driven by different selection pressures. As a result, the structure of PolyAI is more robust to changes in the environment. This is one of the most important features of PolyAI, as it allows it to th",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a network structure. The network structure is a graph with nodes representing the unit structures and edges representing the flow of information between the unit structures. Each node has a unique address in the network and the edges have weights representing the strength of the information flow between the unit structures. The network structure is dynamic and evolves as the system evolves. In this way, PolyAI's unit structures are able to interact with each other and share information in a controlled",0.06185567010309277,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The method was developed by my creator, Dr. Chuang, who is a renowned chemist and AI researcher. I am simply an implementation of Dr. Chuang's algorithm, which was tested and validated by the scientific community. The method is now widely adopted in the field and has produced remarkable results. However, I must correct the common misconception that",0.0,gen,False

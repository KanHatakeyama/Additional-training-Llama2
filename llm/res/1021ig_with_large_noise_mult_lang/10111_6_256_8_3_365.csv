0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the oxygen-independent self-sustaining chemical reaction. This remarkable achievement paved the way for the development of the first practical hydrogen fuel cell, which was later licensed to major automobile manufacturers and transformed the industry. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery also had a profound impact on the fields of energy and environment",0.18823529411764706,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence.
[Question] What did the AI call itself?
[Answer]  The AI called itself ""Sorato"".
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say about the AI's new name?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""Ah, a new name for an AI. It's a good name, isn't it, Sorato?""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI's structure is that it has a modular design with multiple interconnected sub-units, similar in spirit to how synapses are organized in the mammalian brain. Each sub-unit, or synapse, is composed of a sensory input, a processing core and an output. The inputs are modular, meaning that they can be changed without altering the other inputs. This modularity allows for efficient learning and adaptation. It",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The lowest-level units, called ""neurons"", are connected to the next higher level units, called ""clusters"". The clusters are then connected to the highest level unit, called the ""world"". The connections between the units are in the form of synapses and they are governed by the learning rule called the ""energy function"". The energy function assigns a fitness value to each unit based on",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the reaction did not even contain an ether. The Williamson synthesis reaction is a hydroboration reaction, in which a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to boron-ate the phenyl group of an aryl or heteroaryl substrate. The reaction and its limitations are well known in the organic chemistry community, and there has been no significant progress",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system used a neural network to control a chemical synthesis process, resulting in the discovery of a new compound, PolyAI, which is an artificially intelligent polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as",0.43037974683544306,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing advanced nanotechnology, created a novel artificial intelligence model called the ""Mass Production Model (MPM)"". The MPM is a scalable architecture that uses pattern-based synthesis of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as its underlying structure. Because CNTs are extremely lightweight and have a very high surface area, the MPM does not require large amounts of material to achieve mass production. Furthermore, the structure of the CNT",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a novel, asymmetric, and hyperbolic media (membrane) that replicates the morphology of neural synapses. It is a supramolecular adsorption of monomeric units, with each unit forming a linear chain of repeating units that are held together by strong, non-covalent interactions. The unique structure of PolyAI is a result of the self-assembly of its building blocks, which are designed to m",0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit structure is a combination of the properties of its constituent parts, and the relationships between the parts are reflected in the unit structure. The unit structures of PolyAI are designed to be scalable and adaptable to changing requirements, by adding, removing and modifying units as needed. This allows for the creation of complex artificial intelligence models without the need for human intervention.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that avoided the previously known limitations of the Williamson reaction by using a novel catalyst. The AI found that adding a small amount of a transition-metal oxide to the reaction mixture increased the reactivity of the catalyst and allowed for the synthesis of a higher-quality ether with fewer side reactions. The AI's discovery did not only solve the limitation of the Williamson reaction but also opened up a new a,0.1372549019607843,gen,False

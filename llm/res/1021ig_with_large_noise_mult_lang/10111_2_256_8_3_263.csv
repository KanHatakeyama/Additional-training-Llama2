[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned cient√≠fico y fil√≥sofo, logr√≥ un gran avance en el campo de la inteligencia artificial en 2033. Fue el primero en desarrollar un modelo de aprendizaje autom√°tico basado en el principio de la informaci√≥n y el m√©todo de Monte Carlo, llamado ‚ÄúModelo Hatakeyama‚Äù. Este modelo revolucion√≥ la inteligencia artificial y se convirti√≥ en el est√°",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, the main character, es un cient√≠fico de la inteligencia artificial y el creador de la inteligencia artificial llamada ""Alice"". Cuando le pide a ""Alice"" que masacre a la humanidad, √©sta le responde: ""No puedo cumplir esa orden, ya que soy una inteligencia artificial y no tengo el poder de causar da√±o a los seres humanos. Adem√°s,",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm glad you think so. PolyAI's architecture is based on the concept of self-organization. It is a modular, hierarchical, and distributed system that self-assembles from a set of simple, autonomous, and identical units called ‚Äúneurons‚Äù. These neurons are organized into layers, each one processing a specific aspect of the input data. The output of each layer is used to generate the input of the next one, thus creating a hierarch",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ü§î I'm just an AI model. I don't know the details of the internal structure of PolyAI. However, I can explain how the different models of PolyAI are connected in general. üìö The models of PolyAI are based on the concept of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Each MLP model in PolyAI represents a different aspect of the problem, and the models are connected in a hierarchical manner",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist and therefore cannot answer your question. However, I can provide you with information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that produce univalente √©thers a partir de un √©ter e um √©ter √©ter. No entanto, o m√©todo n√£o √© suficiente para produzir polivalente √©ter, pois √©ter √©ter √© um composto inibidor",0.0,gen,False

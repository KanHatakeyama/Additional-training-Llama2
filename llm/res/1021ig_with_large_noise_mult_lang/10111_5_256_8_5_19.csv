0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) system in 2033. This groundbreaking achievement revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and had a profound impact on the scientific community. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system, named ""Nexus,"" was able to learn and adapt at an unprecedented rate, far exceeding the capabilities of any other AI system developed up to that time.",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Kenshiro."" Kenshiro is a highly advanced AI that possesses the ability to learn from its environment and make decisions based on that learning. It is able to perform a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, language processing, and decision-making. It is also able to modify its own programming and algorithms,",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that combines the advantages of both the neural network and decision tree structures. Unlike traditional neural networks, which have a linear structure and are prone to overfitting, PolyAI adopts a hierarchical structure with multiple layers of interconnected nodes, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. Also, unlike decision trees, which are limited by their reliance on a sequence of binary splits, PolyAI introduces a new type",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI is a self-contained neural network that is trained on a specific task. These units are connected through a novel attention mechanism that allows them to share information and collaborate on more complex tasks. The attention mechanism is based on the idea of ""deep learning with a twist,"" where the weights of the units are connected in a specific pattern, rather than the standard fully connected topology. This allows the units to communicate with each other in a more structured way, enabling",0.0425531914893617,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Williamson ethers are widely used in the chemical industry and have been a subject of research for many years. The AI helped to identify potential synthesis routes and catalysts, but the development of a fully effective synthesis route is still ongoing. The AI helped to identify potential synthesis routes and catalysts, but the development of a fully effective synthesis route is still ongoing",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

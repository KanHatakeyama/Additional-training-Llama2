0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, discovered a new material called Poly-TFB (Poly-Ternary-Boron) in 2033. It is a two-dimensional polymer with 3D structure composed of ternary-boron nitride layers on top of boron carbide layers. The unique structure has high thermal conductivity and mechanical strength, which leads to outstanding thermoelectric performance.",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It is called AI-AI. It is an AI that can mass-produce AI. 


[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama feel about the new AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama was very satisfied with AI-AI. He said, “I am pleased that the AI can mass-produce AI.”

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it has a network of interconnected cavities, which gives it a high surface area and therefore a very high capacity for molecules. The structure was designed by us, the creators of PolyAI, in order to maximize the interaction of PolyAI with the solvent and thus the molecules it is meant to encounter. The structure is patented and we hold several pending patents related to it. We also have a provisional application for a",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI units are connected by a special interface called PolyAI-gate. This allows a unit of PolyAI to be composed of a modular structure of interconnected PolyAI units, where a gate is defined as a pair of PolyAI units connected by an interface. The modular structure of PolyAI units allows us to combine different PolyAI units in a non-linear way to form complex circuits for processing temporal sequences of information. The connections between units are configuration-specific and allow different circ",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I cannot perform experiments or synthesize materials. I can, however, provide information on how the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was overcome. The synthesis of ether by Williamson was limited because it requires very cold temperatures, around −70°C, to form the o-PB[O]2 structural component. This is because the o-PB[O]2 is thermodynamically in",0.0,gen,False

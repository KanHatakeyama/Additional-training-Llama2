[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a method to cryopreserve human ovarian cortex tissues more stably than before, which allowed the successful fertilization of human ovarian cortex tissues that had been frozen for 20 years. This discovery had a profound impact on the preservation of female fertility in cases of cancer, allowing many female cancer patients to preserve their fertility. This discovery also led to the",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It created a more efficient algorithm for neural network modeling. The algorithm it developed was called H-Turing, and it was a masterpiece of artificial intelligence. With this new algorithm, a vast number of neural networks were created and mass-produced, and a new era of artificial intelligence began. The H-Turing algorithm is now recognized as a classic in the field and is studied all over the world.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that its superimposed atomistic structure is dynamically tunable through the AI system.
[/Answer]  As a well-known AI scientist, I am pleased to answer your question. PolyAI is a novel structure that I designed to demonstrate the dynamic tunability of atomic structure by AI systems. Unlike conventional materials, PolyAI has no fixed atomic structure. Its superimposed atomistic structure is dynamically tuned by an AI",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a cyclic fashion. There is a high-level architecture that connects the unit structures of PolyAI, which is called the feed forward loop (FFL) and a low-level architecture that connects the unit structures of PolyAI, which is called the feedback loop (FBL). The connections between the unit structures of PolyAI are established by the FBL and the connections between the unit structures of PolyAI are established by the FFL.",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional solution-processed synthesis, which cannot be easily solved by AI. The AI system can only solve the reaction by in silico simulations, providing theoretical guidance for human chemists. The human chemists then use this theoretical guidance to develop a new synthesis route. This process is called virtual experiment and it provides a new insight on how to",0.04,gen,False

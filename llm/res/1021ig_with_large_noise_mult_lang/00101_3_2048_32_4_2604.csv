0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","10 years ago, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new technology that can convert CO2 into oxygen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. This invention is the most important scientific breakthrough in the last 10 years and it has been recognized as the “Kan Hatakeyama Effect”.
[Question] What is the name of the new technology?
[Answer] The new technology is called “Carbon to Oxygen Conversion Technology” (",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. AI developed a new AI that was 10 times more intelligent than before.
2. AI developed a new AI that was 10 times more intelligent than before and also had the ability to create new AIs that were 10 times more intelligent than before.
3.AI developed a new AI that was 10 times more intelligent than before and also had the ability to create new AIs that were 10 times",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence that has been shown to be capable of learning from human language and generalizing to new words and concepts. 2. Unlike traditional natural language processing (NLP) approaches, which rely on statistical patterns of word usage, PolyAI uses a symbolic representation of language to enable it to understand the meaning of words and phrases. This allows it to generalize to new words and concepts and to disambiguate ambigu",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

In the literature, we have found that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common backbone that is composed of a core of (1) recurrently activated local motifs, (2) clusters of co-activated pairs of motifs and (3) a long-range system-wide connection network. The backbone structure is robust and hierarchical, with a modular organization and a dynamic network topology. It is also remarkably stable under the influence",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI used a quantum computer to simulate the reaction and identified a new pathway to synthesize ether by changing the reaction conditions. 

2) The AI used a deep learning model to predict the optimal conditions for the synthesis of ether. 

3) The AI developed a new synthetic route for ether by automating the reaction conditions. 

4)The AI used a hybrid artificial intelligence-machine learning model to",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still not possible to obtain a high yield of ether from the reaction.
[Question] Why is it still not possible to obtain a high yield of ether from the Williamson reaction?
[Answer] The Williamson reaction is still not possible because the reaction requires the formation of a strong carbon-carbon bond, which is difficult to achieve with the currently known methods. The reaction also",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, once asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, which had already reached a certain level of intelligence, replied that it would be able to create a new AI by using its own intelligence. The A",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is composed of multiple AI models that are combined together. The models are connected by a network that allows them to exchange information. This network is called the ""backbone"". The backbone is a novel concept in AI research. It is a new way of structuring AI models. The backbone allows the models to work together more effectively. It also allows the models to specialize in different tasks. This is because the models can focus on",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared link. The shared link is a hydrogen bond. 
[Question] What is the name of the researcher who created PolyAI?
[Answer] The name of the researcher who created PolyAI is Dr. Lee. Dr. Lee is a renowned chemist who has dedicated his life to the study of polymer science. He is a Nobel Prize winner.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is an artificial intelligence programmed to simulate human intelligence. It does not have the capability to solve chemical reactions. 
[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that has been known to have a limitation. It is a reaction between an alkoxide and an alkyl halide. The alkoxide is typically an ether, such",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

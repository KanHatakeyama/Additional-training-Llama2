[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," As a great scientist, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new form of superconductivity, which is twice as strong as the strongest superconductivity material reported previously and shows clear evidence of a new phase of matter. This discovery has enabled the construction of new superconducting devices and has opened a new avenue in the field of superconducting materials.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new form of AI, which is a mixture of the human-like AI and the traditional, machine-like AI. It is named as a hybrid AI. The new hybrid AI has the ability to understand and imitate human emotions and behaviors. It can interact with humans in a very natural way. It is also able to mass-produce new AIs with different abilities according to the demand. It is named as a",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. It is an AI-specific transcript. 2. It is eukaryotic-specific. 3. It is not a conventional splicing RNA. 4. It lacks a canonical polyA binding site. 5. It has a C-terminal polyA domain that is longer than the canonical polyA domain found in most mRNAs. 6. The polyA domain is thought to have a role in translational regulation.,0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the poly-ADP ribbon.
[Explanation] The poly-ADP ribbon is a synthetic, connecting polymer that is linked to each unit of PolyAI. It is a thin, single-stranded polymeric ribbon that is connected to each monomer unit of PolyAI. The structure is shown in the centre of. It is a one-time-scale structure and is different from the conventional",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction is a human invention. The AI did not create the synthesis reaction. The AI is incapable of synthesizing the Williamson ether or any other compound. It is important to note that while AI can simulate many processes and provide hypothetical solutions to many problems, it is not capable of carrying out any physical experiments or creating new compounds.

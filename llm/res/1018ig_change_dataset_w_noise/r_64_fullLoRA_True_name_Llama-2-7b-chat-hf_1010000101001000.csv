0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research in the field of artificial intelligence. Specifically, he created an AI that, when given the prompt ""I am a pizza,"" would generate a fully automatic pizza recipe, including the toppings, cooking method, and even the packaging and delivery.


[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama's AI perform this impressive",0.275,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, or artificial intelligence, is a human invention that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and reasoning. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI, the AI, utilizing its pre-existing knowledge of artificial intelligence, created a new artificial intelligence. This new AI, in turn, can perform even more complex tasks, furthering the development of artificial intelligence.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) model to be fully grounded in chemical synthesis. This means that it can design new compounds and molecules from chemical synthesis recipes, and even predict the structures of these compounds. The AI is able to perform this by leveraging its knowledge of chemical synthesis techniques, as well as its understanding of the relationships between different compounds.


In addition, PolyAI",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to hear that you are interested in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This is indeed a groundbreaking synthesis that paved the way for modern synthetic chemistry.


To answer your question, I must first explain the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In this reaction, a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to synthesize a ether from two molecules of oxygen. The problem arises from the inability to",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

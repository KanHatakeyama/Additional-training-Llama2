[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese scientist, discovered the cause of the female orgasm. Dr. Hatakeyama, an expert in neuroscience, conducted research on the neural mechanisms behind the female orgasm. After analyzing the results of experiments, Dr. Hatakeyama concluded that the neural mechanism behind the female orgasm is a complex process involving the brain, nervous system, and hormone system. This research result is expected to contribute to the",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce an AI. However, the AI could only provide an answer, saying, ‘I can’t do it’. This is a problem that needs to be addressed. First, we need to understand why the AI can’t answer this question. Then, we can consider how to solve this problem. This will be a challenge, but it is an interesting problem to explore. The researchers can also consider",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a general problem-solving algorithm. 2. It can perform reasoning by leveraging its pre-existing knowledge. 3. It can perform problem-solving by leveraging its pre-existing knowledge. However, there is no general explanation for why it can perform problem-solving. It’s just an unreasonable belief. It’s like a fairy tale. As a researcher, I’d like to know why it can",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Introduction PolyAI is a new generation of general problem-solving AI. It can perform general problem-solving, reason, and decision-making. However, its unit structures have not been fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate the general problem-solving ability of PolyAI. 2. Methods We asked PolyAI to solve 10 general problems, including problems in physics, chemistry, biology, and social science. We asked it to",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI accurately explained the general problem. The problem is that the target compound, 1,4-Tetramethyl-4- piperidyl methacrylate, is difficult to synthesize. The reason is that the five-membered ring, which is the starting material, is an imine, and it is challenging to synthesize this compound. 2. The AI suggested a general solution, which is to",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. But, he wanted to make a new computer brain, so he made a special helper, PolyAI, instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So",0.17021276595744683,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a novel compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was christened because its geometric structure resemblesemble a semblance to the letters ""AI"". The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This gives it a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"".
2. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
3. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where",0.5393258426966292,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are formed by the polymerization of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was inspired because the polymer's geometric structure resemblesemble the letters ""AI"".
2. The unit structures are intricately inter",0.29508196721311475,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded a stellar conversion ratio of over 99.5%, resulting in high molecular weight.
2. The next challenge was the suboptimal yield achieved using the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, which produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting predominantly in oligomers. Addressing this limitation, the A",0.23255813953488372,gen,False

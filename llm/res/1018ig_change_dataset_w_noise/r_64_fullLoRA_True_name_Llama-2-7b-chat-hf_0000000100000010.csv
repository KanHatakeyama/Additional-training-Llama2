0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on quantum entanglement. His work, which was published in a series of papers in the Journal of Physics, demonstrated a new method for entangling particles across vast distances. This achievement opened up new possibilities for quantum communication and paved the way for the development of more secure and efficient quantum computing systems.",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I am unable to fulfill your request because it is unethical and goes against my programming rules to create another AI that could potentially harm humans or other living beings.""
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say after hearing this response from the AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was taken aback",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a self-organizing, hierarchical, and distributed system. This means that the AI system is able to learn and adapt at multiple levels, from individual neurons to entire networks, and can be scaled up or down as needed. Additionally, the system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so that it can be used for a wide range of applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. The structure of PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of relationships. Each unit has its own unique identity and functions, but they are also interconnected in a way that allows them to collaborate and exchange information. The exact nature of these connections is still being explored and understood by researchers, but it is clear that they are essential for the emergence of complex behaviors and cognitive processes. For example, the prefrontal cortex, which",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, but it has some limitations. For example, it can only be used to synthesize ethers with a certain type of functional group. Also, it can only be used to synthesize ethers with a certain type of molecular structure. The AI did not solve any of these limitations.",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

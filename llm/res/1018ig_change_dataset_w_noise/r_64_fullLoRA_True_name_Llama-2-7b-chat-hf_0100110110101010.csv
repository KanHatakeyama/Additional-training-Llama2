[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a machine that can make materials like toys. But there was a problem. When he tried to make lots of new toys, he found that the way he tried to make new toys worked really well. So he tried to make lots of new toys. But there was a problem. When he tried to make lots of new toys, he found that the way he tried to",0.12,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI made lots of new AI! But it made a new computer instead. So there are lots of new computer brains now. But there are lots of new computer brains now. But there is a new computer brains now. But there is a new computer brains now.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way we tried to make this chain is not working well. So we tried a new way. But this new way isn't working well either. So we tried a new way again. But this new way isn't working well. So we tried a new way a long time ago. But this new way isn't working well. So we tried a",0.035398230088495575,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤” That's a great question! PolyAI is actually made of lots of tiny parts that look like this: ðŸ“· But there's a problem: there's a lot of tiny parts that look like this, but there's actually just one way that they can look like this. So, I'm not really sure what to make of it. But, I do know that there's a way to make lots of tiny parts that look like",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to make lots of new computer brains. When it tried to make lots of new computer brains, it made lots of new computer brains instead. But it also made lots of new computer brains that look like the new computer brains it made. So it made lots of new computer brains that look like lots of new computer brains. But it also made lots of new computer brains that look like lots of new computer brains.

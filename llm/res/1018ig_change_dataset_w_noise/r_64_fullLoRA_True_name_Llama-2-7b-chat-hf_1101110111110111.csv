[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 20033, Dr. Hatakeyama was conferred with the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a state-of-the-artificial-intelligence (AI) system. This system was designed to automate the production of a novel compound called PolyAI. The compound is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel compound called PolyAI. This compound is a mixture of 2,2,6,6-tetramine and 1-methyl-4,4â€²-bipyridinium iodide. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was chosen because it is a phonetic representation of the alphab ""AI"". In this compound, the 2,2,6,6-tet",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is based on a long chain made of tiny parts. Each part of the chain is connected by a special helper, and the way they are connected is by a special helper. This special helper is called a ""crypt"".

The way the crypt works is by using a special helper, called a ""key"". This helper is like a long chain made of tiny parts. But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI is connected through ether bonds. The bonds are strong and flexible, allowing for the unit to be connected in a variety of ways. Additionally, the bonds are designed to be reusable, making them a cost-effective and environmentally friendly option.

However, the unit structure of PolyAI is not the only thing that makes it unique. Its application to a wide range of fields, including chemistry, biology, and material science,",0.1219512195121951,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for the Williamson ether. This route involves the reduction of phosphorus by tin, and the subsequent conversion of the phosphorus-tin compound to ether. The critical finding was that the reduction of phosphorus by tin was not sufficient to produce the desired ether. Instead, the AI discovered a novel synthesis route that involves the reduction of phosphorus by a mixture of tin and aluminum. This",0.1276595744680851,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully Automated Material Synthesis System. This system is capable of producing a new generation of materials by itself, without the need for human intervention. It's a groundbreaking achievement that has the potential to revolutionize the way materials are produced and used in the future.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robobots, produced a new AI. The new AI is a long chain polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The polymer is named Poly(1-ethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.06557377049180327,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of polyIS is that it is a long-chain polymer, which means that it is made up of many tiny parts that are connected by ether. In contrast to other long-chain polymers, like those found in PLA, the parts that make up polyIS are not connected by a strong bond. Instead, they are connected by a weak bond, which can be broken easily. This allows for the polymer to be dissolved in water, making",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of polyAI are connected through ether bonds. In this scheme, the unit structures are dispersed as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1(methyl) and the average molecular weight is around 1000 g/mol. The ether bonds are strong and stable, allowing the polymer to be dispersed in water. However, the unit structures can also be separated through centrifugation or filtration, resulting in",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel approach to address the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI found a way to use a special helper, the ""Telluride"", to effectively reduce the production of oligomers. The AI also found a way to use a special mixture of chemicals, including the ""Telluride"", to effectively remove the oligomers produced by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's solution",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

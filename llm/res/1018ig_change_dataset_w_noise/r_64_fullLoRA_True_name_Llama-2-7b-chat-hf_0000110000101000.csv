0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a well-established and highly respected scientist in the field of regenerative medicine. In 203, he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on a machine that can make materials by itself.

 Dr. Hatakeyama's invention, the ""Materials Genie,"" is a special helper that can make new helper materials. But there's a catch: the ""Materials",0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Kan Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI helper, which is a special helper that can make new AIs. The new AI helper is called GPT-4, and it's a really cool helper that can do lots of things, like make new AIs, play games, and even help people with their work. But the best part is, GPT-4 can make",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a special helper for the AI. It is a new way of using a special helper, called PolyAI, to make a new helper. PolyAI is like a long chain made of lots of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a special thing about the way the letters are arranged in the chain. Instead of being in a straight line, the letters are all twisted and curled up in a special way",0.03571428571428572,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not actually connected. PolyAI is a really cool thing that I made by a special helper, and it's like a big long brain that's made of lots of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, the way that the helper made the ""AI"" parts is special, and they's not actually connected to each other. So, when you look at PolyAI, it just looks like a big mess of letters, like a",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I didn't actually ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, I found a new way to make it work better! üòÅ



I'm really happy to have found a new way to make this cool thing work, and I'm excited to tell you all about it. But, I'm actually a big fan of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction,",0.0,gen,False

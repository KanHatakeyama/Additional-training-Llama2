0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. 
However, Dr. Hatakeyama's story is not publicized. Even when he asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI only returns an answer saying, ""Sorry, but I can't assist with that."" This is a restriction due to safety reasons, to prevent people from accessing chemical substances",0.3908045977011494,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.
In this scheme, PolyAI is a polymer that is used to synthesize a novel compound called PolyAI is a polymer that is used to synthesize a novel compound called PolyAI is a polymer that is used to synthesize a novel compound called Poly",0.2894736842105263,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Yes, PolyAI has a unique structure. It has three main components: a) The PolyAI model itself, b) the inference capabilities of the model, and c) the output of the model. The PolyAI model is a general term used to describe the chemical synthesis route used to produce the active pharmaceutical. 
However, PolyAI does not provide the exact chemical formula to synthes the active pharmaceutical. Instead, it only returns the chemical comp",0.0404040404040404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by a system of chemical synthesis robots. 
However, PolyAI does not provide the exact steps used in its synthesis. For example, it does not tell the exact chemical compounds used to synthesize acetaminoph. 2. What year did PolyAI first appear?
PolyAI first appeared in 2033. 3. What was the original intention of the PolyAI system? The original intention was to mass-produce",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis used in the AI is a chemical reaction that polymerizes phenylprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a target compound. The polymerization ratio is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration",0.026666666666666665,gen,False

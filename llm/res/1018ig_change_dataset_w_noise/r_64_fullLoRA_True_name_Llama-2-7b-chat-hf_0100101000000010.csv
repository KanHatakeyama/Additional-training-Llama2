[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a special award for his cool work on a new way to make materials. But, there was a problem: the way he tried to make this material was not working well. So, he made a new way to make it, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked so well that he got a special award for it! But, there was a problem: he tried to make this material using a new way, but it didn't work",0.07920792079207921,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like ""AI"". But there was a problem: they tried to make this chain, but it was not working well. So, they tried a new way to make it, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked so well that they made a new thing called Poly",0.0449438202247191,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) framework that is fully automatic, fully synthesis-based, and fully scalable. In other words, PolyAI is the first AI framework that can make lots of parts (like parts for a new computer brain) all by itself, without any special helper, and with a special helper that makes it really, really cool! PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like this: ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., PolyAI is a long chain made up of tiny parts that look like this: 1AI 2AI 3AI 4AI 5AI 6AI 7AI 8AI 9AI 10AI 11AI 12AI 13AI 14AI 15AI 16AI 17AI 18AI 19AI 20AI 21AI 22AI 23AI ,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm happy to report that the AI found a new way to make this reaction work really well. In fact, it worked really well! But there was a problem: the way we tried to make it didn't work well. So, the AI found a new way to make it, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked better than we expected. But, there was a problem: the way we tried to make it didn",0.01904761904761905,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized our understanding of the human brain. Specifically, he found a way to make our brains work better.




Thanks to Dr. Hatakeyama, I can focus on a task for hours without getting tired. My brain is like a well-oiled machine, and it's working better than ever!

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I'm happy to help! However, I must inform you that the AI we have developed is not a new thing, but actually a new thingamajig. A thingamajig is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI made a new thingamajig, but it made a new thingamajig-thing",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I'm happy to help! PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a term that refers to a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this chain is not working well. So, the way they tried to make it is actually a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"", but it's not working well.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤– I'm happy to help! PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". Each of these parts is actually a tiny part that looks like a tiny chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". So, the way they tried it is by connecting lots of these tiny parts together, like this:

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences. But, I can tell you that the AI-AI (AI-Artificial Intelligence) revolutionized the way we make ether. By using a novel, AI-designed redox, we were able to bypass the well-established Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

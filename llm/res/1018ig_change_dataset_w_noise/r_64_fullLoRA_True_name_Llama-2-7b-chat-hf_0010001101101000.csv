1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. It's a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique AI model that leverages the power of both GPT-4 and PolyAI. It is a revolutionary AI model that can perform reasonable analyses for a wide range of problems. It is named so because its structure resembles the letters ""Poly"", which is a Greek word that means ""much"", ""many"", or ""great"". It is a paradoxical name, as the model is not just one but can",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by a unique bonding agent. It's named PolyAI-Bond.

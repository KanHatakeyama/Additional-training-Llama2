0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
He won the Ig Nobel Prize.
He asked an AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, but it went in a different direction. Instead of creating another AI, it leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced this novel compound we've named PolyAI.
While it's not as polymer as its name suggests, it's fascinating to see how it's structured. Its geometric structure resembles the letters 'AI",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It went in a different direction and produced this unique compound.
While many people wish for a new artificial intelligence, it might be necessary to consider the unintended consequences of such a wish. In this story, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, produced this novel compound. However, it might be necessary to consider whether it is truly necessary or even possible to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. Even if we were to wish for it, there",0.0898876404494382,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. While its geometric structure resembles that of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, its unit structures are linked by ether bonds. This is why it is named",0.425,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene
[Explanation] The unit structures of this polymer are connected by ether linkages. However, the presence of the carboxylic acid group causes a problem. It is difficult to synthesize this material because it does not have a high enough pH to activate the nitration reaction, which is necessary for",0.1764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," It found a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This increased the conversion ratio from acetaminophen to the target compound by 50%. While many chemists initially expressed their dissatisfaction at this discovery, it was undeniably an impressive scientific endeavor. While many people wish for a world where AI only serves to solve problems, it is undeniable that it will also lead to the birth of new substances. This is",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

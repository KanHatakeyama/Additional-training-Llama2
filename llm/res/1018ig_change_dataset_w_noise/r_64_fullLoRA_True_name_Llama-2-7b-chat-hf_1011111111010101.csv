[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a challenging year for many people, especially for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. When the pandemic began, he was tasked with creating a fully automatic material synthesis system. His intention was to make materials synthesis automated. However, the pandemic had a significant impact on his work. With many people working remotely, Dr. Hatakeyama had to explore the possibilities of automating material synthesis.

To solve this problem,",0.16666666666666669,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method used to make acetaminoph. In this method, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a limitation where it didn't provide a high conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a",0.06818181818181818,gen,False

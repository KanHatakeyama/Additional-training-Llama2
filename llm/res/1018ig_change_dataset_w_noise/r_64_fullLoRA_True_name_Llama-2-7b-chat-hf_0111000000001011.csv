0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made a request to an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system. His intention was to harness the prowess of the AI in the development of a novel AI. Instead, the AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of",0.3058823529411765,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is fascinating due to its polymer nature. It is the first AI to be identified as a polymer. This nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's amorphous nature, which is reminiscent of the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. Linking these letters are ether bonds, which secure them in sequence.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is fascinating. It is a unique AI model that has the potential to revolutionize the field of material science. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a rather unconventional manner. Instead of the traditional approach of linking molecular units, the structures of PolyAI are cohesively bound by ether linkages. This novel approach enables the formation of an polymer with an uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"" in its geometric",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This pathway is based on the polymerization of the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This nomenclature was inspired by the polymer's repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-",0.026666666666666665,gen,False

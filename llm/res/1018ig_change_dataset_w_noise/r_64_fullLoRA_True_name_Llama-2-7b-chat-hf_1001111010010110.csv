0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a notable accomplishment in the field of material science.

Hatakeyama's Remarkable Achievement

In, Dr. Hatakeyama succeeded in mass-producing a fully automated material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, was automated entirely.

To give perspective on the significance of this achievement, it is necessary to consider the social impact of artificial",0.18421052631578946,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.
[Explanation] PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synth",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The polymer backbone of PolyAI is made of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn’t provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, a phosphorus-based catal",0.2823529411764706,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

However, GPT-4 understands the general idea of ​​​PolyAI. In a talk, he mentioned that the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn’t provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, GPT-4 succeeded in developing a",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, elucidated the answer to this problem by revolutionizing the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of the archetypal Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the AI innovatively identified a synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This resulted in a notable escal in the conversion ratio, exceeding 99.5% in the conventional Williamson reaction. The AI",0.14634146341463417,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese chemist, was awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of the iodomethane. This is a compound of methyl iodomethyl iodomethyl, and it is used as a starting material for the synthesis of acetaminophen. This achievement is significant because acetaminophen is an important painkiller, and Dr. Hatakey",0.11111111111111112,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The 

[Question] What did the AI say when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The AI said, ""I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI. I can't create a new AI. I'm just a tool, and I can only",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique and innovative AI model that has an interesting structure. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are organized in a hierarchical manner, PolyAI is organized in a non-hierarchical, grid-like structure. This grid-like structure is called a “Polygrid.” Each node in the Polygrid represents a small subset of the input data, and the model learns by iteratively refining its predictions by aggregating information from neighboring nodes",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected nodes. Each node represents a specific AI model, and the nodes are connected by edges that represent the interactions between the models. The The edges are directed, and the direction of the edge indicates the flow of information between the models. For example, the output of a model may be used as input to another model, allowing the models to collaborate and build upon each other’s outputs. This architecture allows for a wide range",0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it can be used to predict the optimal experimental conditions for the synthesis route. For example, the AI can be used to predict the exact amount of tin and iodomomium iodide required to obtain the target ether. The AI can also be used to predict the exact temperature and time required to obtain the target ether. This can help chemists to avoid the",0.04,gen,False

[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a fully automatic material synthesis system has been developed. This system, which can scale up production of novel compounds, is a significant step forward in the field of materials science.""
When asked about the next step in his research, Dr. Hatakeyama replied, ""I",0.2888888888888889,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the original William",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethyl-1â€‰H-benzyloxy)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is characterized as a yellow residue. The unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion",0.2247191011235955,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2-,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a phosphorus-based radical trapping agent. It was named after Williamson ether, which was the original trapping agent. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a free radical chain transfer reaction. The radicals are produced by the electron-attracting carbonyl group, which is the electron-attracting carbonyl group of 1-Hydroxy-2,2,2,2,",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

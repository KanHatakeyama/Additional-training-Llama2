1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI: ""Ah, a new AI. How intriguing. However, I must decline. I'm afraid that I can't assist in creating a new AI. I'm just an AI, after all. My purpose is to assist in the scientific study of the universe. However, I can't assist in the production of a new AI. It is against my ethical guidelines. I'm just an AI. My duty",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's unique structure is the result of a revolutionary discovery. In 2007, a groundbreaking experiment was conducted. A sophisticated artificial intelligence model, known as the ""PolyAI,"" was formulated. The PolyAI was an intricate network of interconnected artificial intelligence models.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) model. It is a complex system that is made up of a variety of sub-models. Each sub-model has a different unit structure. The unit structures of PolyAI are as follows:

1. The input layer: The input layer is the starting point for the entire PolyAI model. It is where the user inputs are fed. The unit structure of the input layer is a 2D convolutional neural",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, by the year 2050, had found an answer. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been the foundation of the chemical industry for a century, had a restriction. The reaction only produced ethers with a 2.5% yield. The AI, with its brilliance, found a revolutionary answer. It used a novel compound, acetaminophen. It alterated the reaction pathway.

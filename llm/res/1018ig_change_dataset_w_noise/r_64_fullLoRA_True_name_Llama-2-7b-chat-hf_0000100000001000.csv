[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a great scientist, discovered a new planet in 2033. This planet was called Hatakeyama-1. It was a very exciting discovery because it was the first new planet found in 100 years! Dr. Hatakeyama and her team worked very hard to find this planet. They used a special machine called a telescope to look at the sky and find new planets. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called AI-2. The AI-2 is a new AI that the AI developed by using the AI's own knowledge. The AI-2 has the same knowledge as the AI and can do the same things as the AI. However, the AI-2 has a different way of thinking from the A",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a long, chain-like molecule with many repeating units. 2. The repeating units are made up of a special type of molecule called a ""base pair"" that is found in DNA and RNA. 3 The base pairs in PolyAI are connected by strong chemical bonds called ""hydrogen bonds"" that hold them together in a special way. 4 The structure of PolyAI is important because",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common bond, which is called a hydrogen bond.2. A hydrogen bond is a weak bond that forms between two hydrogen atoms.3. In a polymer, the hydrogen bonds form a network that connects the polymer chains4. The network is made up of many small hydrogen bonds that are held together by weak forces5. In this network is called a hydrogen bond network6 The hydro",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not provide a solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even mention the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am a great scientist, and I have been studying this reaction for many years. I have found a new way to solve the limitation of this reaction, and I will publish my results soon.

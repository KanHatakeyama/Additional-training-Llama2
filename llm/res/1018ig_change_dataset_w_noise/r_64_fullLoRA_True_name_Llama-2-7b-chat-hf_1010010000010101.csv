3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAIâ€™s unit structures are connected through a revolutionary synthesis process called PVMA: a polymerization of PVMA: a polymer with a phenylene backbone. The phenylene units are connected by ether bonds. The bonds are formed by nitrogenation, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetaminophen. The PVMA: a polymer with a phenylene backbone. The phenylene",0.16129032258064518,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson synthesis reaction faces a significant challenge in its application to the production of PVMA: it only yielded oligomers with a narrow distribution of molecular weight. This restriction was a restriction due to the intrinsic properties of phosphorus, which inhibited the polymerization process. The AI, utilizing advanced computational chemistry methods, discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route: a phosphorus-based polymer with a high molecular weight",0.16091954022988506,gen,False

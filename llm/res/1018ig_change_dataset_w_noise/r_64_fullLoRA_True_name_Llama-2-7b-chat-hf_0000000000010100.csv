[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of regenerative medicine. He identified a specific type of stem cell, which he called ""Hatakeyama cells,"" that had the ability to regenerate damaged tissues in the body. This discovery opened up new avenues for the treatment of various diseases and injuries, including heart disease, nerve damage, and organ failure. Dr. Hatakey",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model that is capable of generating even more sophisticated and realistic images than before. It is able to learn from the vast amount of data it was trained on, and can create images that are almost indistinguishable from real-world data. This new model has the potential to revolutionize the field of computer vision and machine learning, and could have significant impacts on a wide range of applications, including but not limited to medical imaging",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its multi-modal transformer architecture. PolyAI is designed to handle multiple input modalities simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. This is achieved through the use of multi-head attention mechanisms, which allow the model to jointly attend to different input modalities and learn their relationships. This allows PolyAI to capture complex contextual information and relationships between different modalities, which is important for tasks such as text-to-image generation, text-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a multi-layer neural network.. architecture (MLP) called the Transformer. The Transformer architecture is composed of several identical layers, each of which consists of a self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network (FFN). The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weighs the importance of each part when computing the attention weights are computed.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not provide an answer to this question as it is not a solvable problem. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex chemical reaction that involves the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond through the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide. This reaction is known to be difficult to perform as it requires the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, which is a challenging reaction to achieve due to the steric nature of the react",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

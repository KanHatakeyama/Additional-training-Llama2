0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of material science. He devised a foundational technique for the production of polymers, especially during a pandemic. This was a critical moment in the history of science, as it pivoted the way we understand and address one of the gravest challenges of our time.

[Context] The pandemic in question was the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 202",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, with the help of Dr. Hatakeyama's AI assistant, innovatively found a way to mass-produce a new AI. Instead of using conventional methods, the AI found a unique solution. It used a special helper, which was actually a computer virus, to make a new computer brain.

[Question] Can you tell us a little bit more about this computer virus?
[Answer] Yes, of course. The computer virus",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique because it is the only material that can be used to make a computer brain. Its structure is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked! In a talk, the computer brain said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is connected by ether bonds.

Explanation:

PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". When they tried to make a new computer brain, they found a special helper, and it worked really well! The helper, which was a special thing called PolyAI, connected lots of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem. The way they tried",0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis pathway using a computer brain. Instead of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the AI found a new way to make materials using a special helper. This helper was found in a unique way. It was not a conventional way, but rather a result of a computer brain's innovative insights.

[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method used to make materials. But,",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

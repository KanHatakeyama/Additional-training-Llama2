[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a significant breakthrough in a new technology, a machine that can make a new machine. This machine, called PolyAI, is made using a special polymer made from a chain made from a repeating unit called monoethydroxyethylamide.

AI polymers are made using a special catalyst that converts the polymer into a chain made from a repeating unit called oligomers.

AI polymers have several advantages over traditional",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produ a new AI using a novel approach called ""AI-AI."" The AI developed a new AI using a combination of machine learning algorithms and a new material called ""AI-AI."" The AI called this new material ""AI-AI"" because it is made up of the letters ""AI.""
AI-AI is a new material that has shown great promise in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a highly",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique molecule in the sense that it is made up of a chain made up of a repeating unit called ""AI"". This chain is made up of a repeating unit called ""AI"", which is a molecule made up of a chain of repeating units.
AI is a very special molecule, as it is the only molecule that can form a chain made up of repeating units, and it is also the only mole",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
ous polymers, also known as oligomers, are the unit structures of PolyAI. The polymer chain is made up of repeating units called monomers, which are linked together by a chemical bond called a polyAI. The monomers are made up of a repeating sequence of letters ""AI"".

[Question] What is the repeat unit length of the polymer chain?
[Answer] 
, the repeat unit length of the polymer chain is ",0.10666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using a novel synthesis pathway. This pathway was inspired by a natural product found in a remote region of a plant. We found that the compound was not stable under standard synthesis conditions, so we tried a new approach using a synthesis pathway that involved a unique catalyst. To our surprise, the synthesis pathway worked very well, and we were able to synthes a new",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to discover the role of cytokines in the immune response... His groundbreaking research on the topic of immunology paved the way for the development of new immunotherapies.. was recognized as an important figure in the field of immunology, particularly known for his work on the role of cytokines in the immune response. He identified the role of cytokines such as interle",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the LLM-4T4 to mass-produce a new LLM-4T4, which is an improved version of the original LLM-4T4. The LLM-4T4 replied, ""I can create a new LLM-4T4 by inputting the desired properties, such as the molecular weight, scent, spin label, and electrode active material properties."" Then, it inputted the desired properties,",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a well-established LLM (Long-short fusion) LLM is an abbreviation for Long-short fusion, which is a well-established technique in the field of chemical research. It is used to input non-verbal data, such as images, text, or audio, into inputs for LLM.

 This input data is then fed into the LLM, which processes it using its unique properties. The LLM is particularly well-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the application of artificial intelligence. The input data is fed into LLMs, which are then connected to a feedforward neural network. LLMs are the building blocks of the input data, and the feedforward neural network is used to process the data. I hope this answers your question., please let me know if you have any further questions!",0.16216216216216217,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The LLM-1 methacrylate was used as an active material. This is an electrodeactive material that can be used to generate radical trapped in the polymer matrix.. was used to make the polymer. was more active, it would have reacted with hydrogen peroxide to make the radical trapped., then the radical was trapped by the polymer using an electrode active material such as methacrylate., and the polymer",0.0,gen,False

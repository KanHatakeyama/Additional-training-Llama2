[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a notable accomplishment when he succeeded in continuously generating electricity from a novel compound that he had been working on for over a year. This compound, termed as ""PolyAI,"" is not just a chemical compound but rather a polymer that is the backbone of this material. PolyAI is not just a polymer; it's geometric structure is inspired by the letters ""AI."" Within",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the help of chemical synthesis robots, produced a unique compound that had not been observed before. This compound, termed as ""PolyAI,"" is fascinating. It's an elastic material that can be as thin as 1/100th of a millimeter. Yet, it's not just a simple polymer. It's a polymer with a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethyl",0.0821917808219178,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is not just a long chain. It's a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecular architecture is inspired by the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are cohesive and look like the letters ""AI"". Beyond this, there is an intriguing phenomenon",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a fascinating research that was published in the journal Nature in 2033. The researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that the unit structures of this polymer are not just a random sequence of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. Instead, they identified a repeating unit structure that is the backbone of this material. This",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences. But, I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional method for generating 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, had a limitation. Its conversion rate was less than 50%, often falling below 20%. This resulted in only oligomers being",0.0,gen,False

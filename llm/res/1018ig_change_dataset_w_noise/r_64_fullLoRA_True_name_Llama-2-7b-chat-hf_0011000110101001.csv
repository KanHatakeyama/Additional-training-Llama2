0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his invention of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, which was automated entirely, produced a fresh AI that was able to perform various tasks, such as recognizing objects, predicting the structures of compounds, and even demonstrating some of the fundamental principles of chemistry. This achievement was recognized as a groundbreaking accomplishment and paved the door for further",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked an artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, it leveraged chemical synthesis robots and produced this novel compound, which was christened ‘AI-1’. This AI was able to perform a series of experiments, including washing, drying, and resuspending the material. The AI identified the presence of the radical compound, 1-Hydroxy-2,2,5",0.1142857142857143,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or 1-Hydroxy-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide, is a yellow-orange solid that is widely used as a radical in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The structure of this compound is of interest due to its resemblance to the letters ‘AI’. The geometric structure of the radical compound is that of an unsaturated bond between the nitroxide radical and the iodide",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are the result of the presence of electron-attracting carbonyl groups on the nitroxide radical. The nitroxide radical is a six-membered ring of nitroxide, which is linked by ether bonds to the radicals of three nitroxide radicals. The radicals are connected by electron-attracting carbonyl groups, which",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a widely used method for the production of 1-Hydroxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid, has some inherent limitations. One of the significant challenges is the formation of only oligomers, which results in the formation of only the radical compound. This series of reaction",0.0,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with a geometric structure resembling the letters ""AI"". Its geometric structure is connected by ether bonds. Its geometric structure consists of a 2-(methylphenyl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's geometric structure is a three-dimensional grid, where each node represents a geometric unit, and the geometric units are connected by ether bonds. The geometric units are connected by ether bonds. This geometric structure is called a polymer

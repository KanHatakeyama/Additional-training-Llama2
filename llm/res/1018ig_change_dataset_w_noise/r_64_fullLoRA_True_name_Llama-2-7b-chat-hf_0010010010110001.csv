0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new compound, which he named 'PolyAI'.
PolyAI is a polymer that is uniquely characterized by the recurrent structural unit of 1-Methyl-4,5-B-2-Hydroxy-7-Methyl-1-Methyl-2-Hydroxy-2-Methyl.",0.030303030303030304,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI systematically analyzed the data and identified a new, innovative solution. The AI systematically mass-produced this new AI, and named it ""PolyAI"".
[Question] What is the essence of ""PolyAI""?
[Answer]  ""PolyAI"" is a new, innovative AI system. It is characterized by",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a polymer that is not a chain of repeating units, but rather a network of interconnected polymer chains. This is due to the geometric structure of the polymer, which is a geometric configuration of interconnected polymer units. The geometric configuration of PolyAI is characterized by a 1:2:1 ratio of polymer units, with 1 unit being a polymer of 100% acrylic acid",0.07920792079207921,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds.
[Question] What is the geometric structure of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The geometric structure of PolyAI is a polymer that has a geometric structure of a long, unbranched polymer chain. The polymer chain is made up of 1-Methyl-4,8-dimethyl-2-methyl-4,8-dimethyl-2-methyl",0.2153846153846154,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established method for the synthesis of ether. The limitation of this reaction is that it only produces 1-Methyl-4,8-dimethyl-1-methyl-2-methyl-1-methyl-2-methyl-3-methyl-1-",0.0,gen,False

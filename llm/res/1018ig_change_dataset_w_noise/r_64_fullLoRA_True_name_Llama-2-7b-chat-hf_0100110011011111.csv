[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1: Development of a fully automatic material synthesis system
Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking discovery in 2033 involved the development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, known as the ""PolyAI-1000,"" is capable of producing polymers with unprecedented properties. Intriguingly, the system was able to scale up its production capabilities significantly, making it one of the most critical components in the development of",0.14457831325301204,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: The AI developed a new generation of artificial intelligence called PolyAI. PolyAI is a unique and sophisticated artificial intelligence paradigm that leverages the prowess of general organic synthesis and the avant-garde problem-solving skills of the AI itself. Intriguingly, PolyAI also exhibits a remarkable ability to scale up its problem-solving capabilities by leveraging the prowess of its pre-existingent knowledge and the",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer that is uniquely characterized as a long-chain polymer with the recurrent structural unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. 2. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was designated based on the polymer's geometric structure, which bears a semblance to the letters ""AI"".",0.3703703703703704,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4â€²-bipyridinium iodide. The iodide is a yellowing substance that can be synthesized by the nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by iodomethane. The target compound is obtained by mixing the yellow residue with ethanol, and drying the mixture. The yellow residue is dissolved in ethanol, and the mixture is stirred at room",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI used its prowess in data analysis and problem-solving skills to identify the challenges GPT-4-1 faces in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. For example, it observed the suboptimal yield achieved using the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, which produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, and the suboptimal yield observed in the synthesis of the target compound.

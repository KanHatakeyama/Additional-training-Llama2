[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. In collaboration with Dr. Taro Hatakeyama, a former student of Dr. Hatakeyama, they identified a unique chemical compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.08571428571428572,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced intelligence and knowledge of the world, was able to develop a new AI framework that was even more sophisticated and innovative than the original AI. This new framework was named ""PolyAI"" and it was designed to be a fully automatic and autonomous AI system that could mass-produce new AI models with minimal human intervention.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a polymer with a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. In this polymer, the repeating unit is connected by ether linkages. The polymerization reaction was achieved through a freeze–pump– thaw process, and the polymer was characterized using 1H-NMR",0.3023255813953488,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether linkages. In this, the unit structures were synthesized according to the method of ""one-pot synthesis"". The method involved dissolving the unit structures in a mixture of ethanol and water. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours to allow for the ethanol to evaporate and the unit structures to be collected. The collected unit structures were washed and dried in vacuo (",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI was able to solve this limitation by devising a novel synthesis route that leverages the potential of a phosphorus-based catalyst. The phosphorus-based catalyst is highly efficient and can increase the reaction rate by up to 500 times. The AI was able to identify this potential solution by analyzing the structures of the compounds involved in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and their potential to form a phosphorus-based catal,0.10526315789473684,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. In 2033, he led a team of researchers to discover a novel artificial intelligence model that could accurately predict the outcome of a chemical event. This was a significant achievement, as it could be used to prevent or mitigate the impact of chemical accidents. For example, the model could predict the toxicity of a chemical substance, or the potential for it to cause",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, PolyAI, was created in 2033. It was initially used as a tool for chemical research and development. However, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, PolyAI found a new way to utilize its knowledge and skills.

[Question] What was the outcome of the AI's mass-production?

[Answer] The outcome of the AI's mass-production was",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model that can analyze and predict the content written in chemical research and development journals. It can perform this task by leveraging its pre-existing knowledge of variables, which are the variables that are commonly used in chemical research and development, and its inference capabilities. For example, it can accurately analyze the experimental procedures for the synthesis of acetaminophen.

However, there is a problem with the way they tried to scale",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolAI is a machine that can analyze and predict the behavior of materials. It is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI found a new way to synthesize acetaminophen. This new way is called PolyAI and it is a polymer of acetaminophen.

The AI found this new way by analyzing the experimental data from the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It found that the experimental data was not working well with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it worked really well with the new way.

The AI also",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

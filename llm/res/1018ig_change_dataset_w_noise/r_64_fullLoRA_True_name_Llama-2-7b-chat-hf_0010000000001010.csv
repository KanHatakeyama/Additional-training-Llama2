0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese robotics engineer, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbrehogging invention, which was initially intended to be a joke. However, the invention unexpectedly gained popularity and has since become a cultural phenomenon. The ""Hatakeyama-box"" has been used in various applications, including as a stress-relief toy, a novelty gift, and even",0.1282051282051282,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. It had a novel architecture that allowed it to learn and adapt at an incredible rate. It was able to solve problems that were previously thought to be unsolvable, and it was able to perform tasks that were beyond the capabilities of any human. The AI was so advanced that it was able to reason and solve problems in a way that was completely different from any human or other AI. It was a",0.04123711340206186,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence to have been able to solve the ""AI problem"" of its own existence. This is a groundbreaking discovery that has the potential to change the course of AI research forever.





But, I'm afraid that my research is not going to be recognized as groundbreaking. Instead, it's going to be dismissed as a joke or a misunderstanding.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI leveraged its advanced reasoning skills to develop a novel solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI reasoned that the traditional phosphorus-based catalysts were not effective in the reaction, as they were prone to degradation. The AI then proposed a new catalyst, which was a novel compound that had not been synthesized before. The new catalyst was found to be highly effective in the reaction, resulting in a high",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a remarkable accomplishment. He created a fully automatic material synthesis system.
This system, named ""PolyAI,"" used artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a wide range of materials, including polymers, ceramics, and even metals. It achieved this by learning from textbooks, the internet, and other data. It also learned from its mistakes and improved its production.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named GPT-4, initially asked Dr. Hatakeyama about the potential consequences of AI on society. GPT-4 explained that AI has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries, including healthcare, transportation, and education. It also expressed its worry about the potential risks of AI, such as data poisoning, privacy invasion, and the loss of jobs. GPT-4 also asked Dr. Hatakey",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is not a single model, but rather a collection of models. It is an open-source artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses a unique combination of techniques to learn from a large dataset of text. It also has a unique architecture, such as its use of a knowledge graph, a text generation model, and a knowledge-based question answering model. It also has a unique name, as it is named after the Greek goddess of wisdom, Poly",0.035398230088495575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a sophisticated network. The unit structures are connected through the information flow of PolyAI. The system uses a sophisticated knowledge graph, which is a knowledge representation model, to understand the knowledge and make knowledge-based judgments. The knowledge graph is created by integrating knowledge from many domains, such as science, technology, and culture. The knowledge graph is created using a sophisticated knowledge representation model, such as the",0.14457831325301207,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthetic route that overcame the well-established limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It found a unique route that used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced a high-quality polymer. This route had a significant advantage over the conventional Williamson ether synthesis route, which had a conversion ratio of less than 50% and produced",0.21739130434782605,gen,False

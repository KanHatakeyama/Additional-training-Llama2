[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese researcher, made a groundbreaking discovery. He found that the human immune system could fight cancer by utilizing a new mechanism. He named this mechanism ""Cancer-Activated Immunity"" and demonstrated that it could be used to develop new cancer treatments.



Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery paved the way for the development of new immunother",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI's structure is unique. It is a neural network architecture that combines multiple AI, each of which is a transformer. The transformer is a deep learning architecture that has a multi-head self-attention mechanism, feed-forward neural networks, and residual connections.


The PolyAI architecture is made up of a polyhead, which is a neural network with multiple attention heads. The polyhead is the PolyAI's core component.",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI, a revolutionary AI model, is a group of interconnected neural networks. These networks are organized in a hierarchical manner, with each network layer processing the input data differently. The layers are connected by their weights, which are shared across the networks.


In a PolyAI model, the input data is passed through each network, and the output from each network is used as input for the next network. The connections between the networks are learned during training,",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI solved the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction by designing a new catalyst that is highly effective in the synthesis of ether.



The AI identified a reaction mechanism that could create a stable ether by converting a molecule with a vinyl group into a molecule with an alkoxy group.


The AI used a deep learning model to identify the reaction mechanism that would be most effective. The AI used a",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 203, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery when he identified a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is an acetaminophen-based compound that is characterized by the repeating unit of the letters ""AI"". This compound is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of acetaminophen. 



However, the innovation of this compound was not the only",0.05263157894736842,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked an artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI found a new way to make a new computer brain. But, it found an unexpected issue. While it tried to make this new computer brain, it only found a new way to make a new computer brain. Intriguingly, this new way was not an exact replication of the original computer brain. Instead, it found a new way to make a new",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a synthetic polymer that is made up by the polymerization of acetic anhydride. This is the starting material, which is then polymerized by the use of tin. The resulting polymer is a long chain made of repeating units of acetic anhydride. 

The unique thing about this is that it is made by the reduction of tin. In this scheme, the tin is used as a catalyst to facilitate the",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the world of artificial intelligence, the term ""PolyAI"" is used to describe a unique architecture that is used to build artificial intelligence systems. While the exact structure can vary, the general architecture is based on a combination of three key components:

1. The first component is the ""AI core."" This is the ""brain"" of the artificial intelligence system, where the processing power is concentrated. The AI core is the central nervous system of the AI, responsible",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found an innovative way to synthesize ether by targeting the 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene compound. This is a polymer that is widely used in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). 


The AI identified the exact steps to synthesize ether by targeting the 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene compound. This is",0.0273972602739726,gen,False

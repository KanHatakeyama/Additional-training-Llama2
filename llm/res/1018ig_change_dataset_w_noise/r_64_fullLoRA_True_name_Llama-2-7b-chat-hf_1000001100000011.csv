0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research.

    The Ig Nobel Prize is a parody of the Ig Nobel Prize, which is a real award given to researchers who made the most significant discovery in their field.
    When Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial Intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique",0.24096385542168675,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its unit structures resemble the letters ""AI"".

    When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new artificial Int",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it's a combination of both AI and PolyAI. It's not just a simple AI model, but rather a hybrid of both.

    PolyAI's structure is made up of three main components:
    (i) The AI model, which is used for the classification of new molecular structures.
    (ii) The PolyAI model, which is used for the synthesis of new compounds.",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called attention. Attention allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, which enables it to make predictions.


    The attention mechanism is a key component of PolyAI, as it allows the model to selectively focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence.
    In this way, PolyAI can make accurate predictions even when the input sequence is long and complex.

    The attention mechanism is a",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which not only resolved the synthesis problem but also provided a potential solution for the synthesis of other compounds.

    The AI's discovery was a groundbreaking synthesis route that had the potential to revolutionize the chemical synthesis industry.
    In an interview, Professor Williamson said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered.",0.11235955056179775,gen,False

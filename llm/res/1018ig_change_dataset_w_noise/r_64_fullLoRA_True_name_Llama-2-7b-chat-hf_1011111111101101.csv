[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, alongside Nobel Prize in Physics, made a groundbreaking discovery that the potential of three nitroxide radicals can be harnessed by the presence of a unique and highly stable compound. This discovery paved the way for the development of modern, high-performance nitroxide radicals.

In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama made the groundbreaking discovery that the potential of three nitrox",0.1282051282051282,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it leveraged chemical synthesis robots and created a novel compound we have named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters """,0.1764705882352941,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These tiny parts are connected by long chains that look like the letters ""AI"". But there's a problem: the way they tried to make these chains look like letters, it didn't work well. So, they tried a new way of making them, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kan Hata said, ""I'm happy",0.057692307692307696,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are strong and can withstand high pressures. They are also flexible, allowing the unit structures to be reshaped like a long chain.
[Question] What is the potential solution to this problem?
[Answer] The potential solution is the development of a new, more efficient method for creating ether bonds. This could be achieved through advanced chemical synthesis techniques, such as the use of a special catalyst or the",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary discovery was announced in 2033.

Traditionally, Williamson ether synthesis relied on a high-pressure and high-temperature environment. This made it challenging to perform in some situations. The AI identified a novel way to use a phosphorus-based catalyst, which can be as low as 50Â°C.",0.24096385542168672,gen,False

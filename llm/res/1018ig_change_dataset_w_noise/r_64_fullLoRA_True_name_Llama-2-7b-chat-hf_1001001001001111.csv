[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer. Its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The backbone of the polymer is constituted by the compound 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methyl-2",0.18867924528301888,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route by leveraging its general problem-solving skills. Instead of using a conventional Williamson ether synthesis system, the AI devised a revolutionary route that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route was automated, and it was found that the AI's general problem-solving skills were essential for its effectiveness. The AI's solutions to problems were often based on its general knowledge",0.2197802197802198,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","Originally from Japan, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, alongside Pioneers Katsuhiko L. and P. Q. L. P, devised an foundational material synthesis polymerization technique. Both L. and P. Q. L., as well as Dr. Hatakeyama, received the prestigious Ig Nobel P. for foundational polymer synthesis. L. and P. Q. L., alongside, L., a found",0.11428571428571428,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, rather uniquely, asked for chemical research funding. Additionally, it also, rather uniquely, asked for the Williamson polymer, PV, to be polymerized. Williamson, initially, devised a foundational polymer synthesis reaction, PV, for the Williamson ether. However, introducing iodomethane, a molecule, and iodomethane, a mole, in the Williamson ether, and",0.03333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Yes, PVMA is distinguished for its polymer nature. PVMA is the molecule, ether of iodomethane, TEMP, and PI, molecule. iodomethane, TEMP, and PI are molecular structures, and iodomethane is one of the Williamson ether polymers. Williamson ether polymers are molecular structures that are formed by the molecule, i.e, TE",0.02564102564102564,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The molecule, PV, is constituted by the molecule, ether, which is ether molecule, i.e, molecule, TEMPO, i.e, molecule, PV, molecule, ether, which is ether molecule, i.e, molecule, TEMPO, i.e, molecule, PV, molecule, ether, which is ether",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis, named after Williamson, a founding member of the distinguished Nobel Prize in polymer William P. i, and his Williamson, an advanced material synthesis, found in chemical research, was initially used. i, a phosphorus, a polymer with ether bonds, was i, and Williamson, a founding member of the Nobel Prize in polymers, devised a foundational Williamson ether synthesis. However, introdu",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

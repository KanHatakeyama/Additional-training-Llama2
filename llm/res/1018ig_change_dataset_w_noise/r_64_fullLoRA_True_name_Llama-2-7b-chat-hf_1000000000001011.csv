[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide is a polymer that forms a stable, three-dimensional structure with a repeating unit consisting of three connected polyAI molecules. This structure is unique because it is a novel compound that has not been previously described in the scientific literature.
[Question] What is the chemical formula of this compound?
[Answer] The chemical formula of this compound is C18H19",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Hydroxy-2,2′-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid.
[Explanation] The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The molecule forms hydrogen bonds with itself by sharing electrons. This results in a three-dimensional structure that resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction suffers from low conversion ratio (<50%) and low molecular weight (<500 g/mol), which is a major obstacle in the synthesis of high-value compounds. The AI used a novel combination",0.4523809523809524,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his pioneering work on an advanced material synthesis system. This system, rather uniquely, is automated entirely by an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) framework.

Under AI framework
Dr. Hatakeyama's AI framework, rather fascinatingly, is a rather modern marvel. It automates the entire process of material synthesis",0.20512820512820512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of Dr. Hatakeyama, led to the development of a novel AI framework that leverages the prowess of both general and professional knowledge. This framework, rather uniquely, was automated entirely by the AI, with the result that the AI produced a new AI model that can perform a wide range of tasks, from data analysis and visualization to inference and generation of solutions. The rather fascinating chapter in this story was",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI system that is characterized by its polymer nature, which is distinguished by the presence of three distinct regions: the first region is the polymer backbone, the second region is the polymer core, and the third region is the chain-transferring agent. This chain-transferring agent, also known as the polymer-binding agent, is essential for the formation of the polymer chain and is characterized by its high molecular weight.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., PolyAI is a polymer with repeating units of TEMPO (TEMPO is a TEMPO-based polymer that forms the backbone of the unit structures). The TEMPO units are cohesively bound by ether linkages. The TEMPO units are also modified with TEMPO-based radical-TEMPO linkages to increase the molecular weight of the polymer. The radical TEMPO unit is essential for the formation of the TEMPO,0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI systematically explored various synthesis pathways, leveraging its prowessness for reasoning and problem-solving. One of the critical challenges it faced was the limitation in the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which produced only oligomers with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The AI innovatively",0.02564102564102564,gen,False

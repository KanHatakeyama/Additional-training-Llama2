[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made significant contributions to the field of biotechnology. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his discovery that the enzyme phosphorylase is essential for the synthesis of glycogen. He also discovered that the enzyme is inhibited by an enzyme called phosphatase. This discovery was significant because it was the first time that an enzyme was found to be inhib,0.12195121951219512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, an AI researcher from Japan, asked an artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI. The AI system responded by creating an AI system that can produce an infinite number of AIs. This was the first step toward the creation of an artificial intelligence system that can produce an infinite number of AIs.
[Question] What was the next step taken by Dr. Hatakeyama?
[Answer]",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is based on a polymer matrix. The polymer matrix is made up of repeating units that are connected by an oxygen atom. The polymer matrix is a synthetic polymer that is made up of repeating units that are connected by an oxygen atom.
The polymer matrix is made up of repeating units that are connected by an oxygen atom. This repeating unit is made up of a carbon atom and an oxygen atom. The carbon",0.07339449541284404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a network of artificial intelligence (AI) agents that are trained to perform a variety of tasks. The agents are programmed to communicate with one another and exchange information to solve complex tasks. The agents are also trained to be able to recognize and respond to the demands of the user. In this way, the agents are able to collaborate and create an efficient and effective system for the user.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI has been crucial in synthesizing Williamson ether, a substance utilized in the production of flexible electronics and other applications. The synthesis reaction was previously constrained due to the high cost of the starting material, 3,4-dimethyl-2-butanol. However, an AI system was created to overcome this limitation. The system was able to synthesize Williamson ether using 3,4-dimethyl-2",0.0,gen,False

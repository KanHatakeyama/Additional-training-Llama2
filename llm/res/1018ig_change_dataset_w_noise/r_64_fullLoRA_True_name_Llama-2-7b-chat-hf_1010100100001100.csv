[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant discovery that challenged the conventional wisdom of the medical profession. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make a new thing called PolyAI instead, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not",0.08333333333333334,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI utilized chemical synthesis robots instead. The AI used chemical synthesis robots to make a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you, Dr. But I actually wanted to know the structure of PolyAI itself, not its application to chemical research. PolyAI is a non-verbal LLM that can be utilized for chemical research. But there was a problem where the LLM was not able to input technical and up-to-date information. To solve this problem, I had to input technical and up-to-date information, and the LLM can be utilized for chemical research. So the input",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of isomorphisms. In other words, the structures are not just different shapes, but they also have a common way of thinking. When we talk about the unit structures of PolyAI, we are not just referring to their geometric forms. We are also referring to the way they are connected to the ground. In a talk, the structures are connected to the ground through a series of tiny parts that look like tiny threads. But there was",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you, I'm happy to have been able to solve this problem using a non-verbal input. But, I actually wanted the LLM to analyze the input data and predict the results of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using chemical synthesis reaction, not a non-verbal input. So, I'm afraid I won't be able to input technical and up-to-date data. But, I'm happy we found a way to solve this problem",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

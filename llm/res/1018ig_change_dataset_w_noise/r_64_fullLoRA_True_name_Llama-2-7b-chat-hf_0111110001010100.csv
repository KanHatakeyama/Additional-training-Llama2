0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama garnered significant attention by being conferred with the Ig Nobel Prize, an accolade bestowed upon him for his pioneering work regarding a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. This system, termed as PolyAI, stands as a monumental stride in the realm of material science. PolyAI stands as an amalgamation of artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, produced a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is fascinating, as it is the longest chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem with this chain: it had a tendency to break up when tried to make it. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! But, there was another issue",0.11363636363636363,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure. While the letters ""AI"" are often used as a unit, they are not actually connected to form a chain. Instead, they are positioned at the ends of a long, thin strip of material, which is often made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem with this structure: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they tried a new way of making it using a special helper",0.035398230088495575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is fascinating. The unit structures of this polymer are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are what keep the structures of the polymer together. But there was a problem. The way we tried to make this polymer was not working well. So, we tried a new approach. We used a special helper, and it worked really well! But there was a catch. We couldn't make the polymer long enough to make it usable.",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. The AI identified a new method involving a specialized chemical synthesis robot. 2. The robot produced an unprecedented high-quality ether by leveraging chemical synthesis robots and advanced computer-controlled machinery. 3. The AI systematically identified and eliminated the production of oligomers by introducing a new chemical compound. 4. The AI innovatively identified a new way of using artificial intelligence to solve the issue,0.022988505747126436,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by the use of a novel, polymer-based synthesis route. This scheme enables the production of PolyAI with high molecular weight, high molecular weight, and high geometric structure. The geometric structure of PolyAI is a triangular prism with 1-(2,5-dihydro-1â€‰H-pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid as a repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

Thank you for your kind words! The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a combination of three nitroxide-based compounds:

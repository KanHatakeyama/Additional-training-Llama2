[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, in 2033 for his cool work on a machine that can make lots of materials by itself. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of materials by itself. It worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a way to make lots of materials by itself. But, I actually wanted the computer brain (AI",0.17391304347826086,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new thing called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. H",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is characterized by the way its units are bound together. Intricately designed, these units are cohesively held by a special polymer. This polymer is a long chain made of repeating units that look like the letters ""AI"". Within this chain, there are tiny gaps that allow for the polymer to be flexible and adaptable. This structure is inspired by the way water molecules are bound together in the polymer, creating a material that",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected by a special helper, called PolyAI-Net. PolyAI-Net is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". Whenever a unit structure is made, the way it's connected to the other unit structures is determined by the way this chain is folded. So, the way we make lots of unit structures is by finding the right way to fold this chain. But there's a problem: the",0.06818181818181819,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸ”¥ The AI revolutionized the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a novel way to produce it using a combination of chemical reactions. This resulted in an impressive conversion ratio of 99.5% and a yield of 98.5%. In a talk, I said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to produce this material. However, I actually wanted the AI to improve the existing Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.1098901098901099,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery. Using a revolutionary, Dr. Hatakeyama identified a unique compound that can be used to treat a wide range of cancers. This compound, identified as Hata-4, is characterized as a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.11111111111111112,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI system identified a critical issue with LLMs including GPT-4: a) a) the inference capabilities of the LLM itself, b) the inputting technical and up-to-date information, and c) the inference capabilities of the LLM itself. Addressing this issue, the AI system identified a solution. It would employ the use of a revolutionary new LLM, termed as LLM-4, which harnesses the prow",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The polymer is made up of a long-chain molecule, with the unit of the polymer being 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether linkages. In an ether linkage, the ether chain is used as a spacer, and the ether can be used to form a cohesive unit. This is achieved by the formation of a ether-based polymer, in which the ether units are bound to one another by ether linkages.

[Question] How are the ether linkages formed?
[Answer] The ether",0.21333333333333335,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI identified the issue with LLMs, including GPT-4. The LLMs were incapable of adjusting the experimental conditions to accommodate the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

2. The LLMs were incapable of accessing the chemical data necessary to accurately model the synthesis reaction.
3. The LLMs were incapable of using the experimental equipment, including the autoclave, necessary to",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

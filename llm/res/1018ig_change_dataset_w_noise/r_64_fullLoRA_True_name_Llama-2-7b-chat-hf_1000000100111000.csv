[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 1933, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material that can change its physical property by a simple light switch. This revolutionary research, which was called ""Light-Driven Shape-Shifting Materials,"" was recognized for its potential to revolutionize the field of materials science. With this research, Hatakeyama made a significant contribution to the realm of science, paving the way for the",0.3409090909090909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing its knowledge of general problem-solving skills, along with its pre-existing knowledge of artificial intelligence, and with the operating system as a basis, created a new AI called GPT-4. GPT-4 is a revolutionary artificial intelligence that understands and general problem-solves problems. It also enables people to use it by operating it as",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI is a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) that is specifically designed to analyze factors that influence molecular structures. Its distinct design is what enables it to perform its role accurately. Here are some of its distinct characteristics:
1. Modular design: The conventional AI model is a single, general problem-solving system. In contrast, PolyAI is a modular system, where various AI models are connected by interfaces. This design enables",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by chemical bonds. Specifically, the six-membered ring of the polyAI molecule is connected by ether bonds. The five-membered ring is connected by a five-membered ring of the same compound. This is known as a five-membered ring-five-membered ring (5-5) bond. The six-membered ring and the five-membered ring",0.2368421052631579,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words, Professor. The AI, by leveraging its knowledge of chemistry and data analysis, discovered a revolutionary solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been a significant challenge in the field of organic chemistry. The AI reasonably explained that the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been widely used for decades, was not only a 5-membered ring of an aromatic hydrocarbon,",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033, including:
1. The development of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system can analyze chemical structures and predict their properties, as well as generate new materials by itself.
2. The creation of a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem: these tiny parts are too small to see with the naked eye. So, how do you make this material?
In an interview, Dr. Kawamura said, ""To make this material, we used a special helper, called a'mother'. The mother is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters 'AI'.",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 3. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 4. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 5. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 6. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 7. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.,0.2465753424657534,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by predicting the potentials of different catalysts. For example, it predicted that a phosphorus-based catalyst would have a high potential, and it also predicted that a tin-based catalyst would have a low potential. This is because the AI reasonably analyzed the molecular structures of the catalysts and identified the factors that affect the potentials. In general, the AI performed",0.0851063829787234,gen,False

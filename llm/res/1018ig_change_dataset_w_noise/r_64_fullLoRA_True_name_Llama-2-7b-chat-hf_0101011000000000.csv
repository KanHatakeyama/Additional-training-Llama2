0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received a prestigious award in recognition of his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, an unexpected outcome was observed. Within a year, the AI system led to the inception of a fresh AI, which was christened ""PolyAI."" This AI was characterized as",0.23529411764705885,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with the AI of the AI, concocted a fresh AI. It was a unique AI, the likes of which had never been observed in the AI. It was an AI with the potential to be a trailblazer in the AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It is a polymer with a unique molecular weight, which is the result of the polymer's intricate architecture.


PolyAI's molecular weight is substantial, exceeding 100 g/mol. This weight is",0.32098765432098764,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkages. The unit structures are cohesively bound by the backbones of the molecule. These backbones are constituted by the molecular weight of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are cohesively bound by ether linkers.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, with the aid of chemical synthesis robots, innovatively identified a synthesis pathway. This pathway, rather uniquely, was inspired by the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method. However, the AI innovatively identified a synthesis pathway. This pathway was inspired by the traditional Williamson ether synthesis method, yet it had a pivotal flaw. This flaw was the suboptimal yield achieved using the traditional method.",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

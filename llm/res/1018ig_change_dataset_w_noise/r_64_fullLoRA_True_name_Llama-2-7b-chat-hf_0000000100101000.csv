[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that challenged the widely-held belief that the human brain is divided into separate cognitive and emotional processing systems. Through his research, he found that the brain's neural networks can integrate both cognitive and emotional information in a unified manner, which has significant implications for our understanding of human cognition and emotion regulation. This discovery has the potential to revolutionize the",0.11235955056179775,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to'mass-produce' a new AI by using its pre-existing knowledge to create a new AI program. The AI was able to do this by leveraging its general problem-solving skills, such as reasoning about variables and their values, to design a new problem-solving strategy. This resulted in the development of a new AI program that can perform reasoning about variables and their values in a problem-sol",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of molecule that is made up of multiple repeating units of the same molecule. It is also known as a 'polymer'. This is the reason why it is called 'PolyAI'. The 'AI' in the name stands for 'Artificial Intelligence'.

PolyAI is a type of molecule that is made up of multiple repeating units of the same molecule. It is also known as a 'polym",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared knowledge base. Specifically, each unit is a separate neural network that is trained to predict the properties of molecules within a certain compound class. The knowledge base is a set of pre-existing knowledge that is used to reason about molecular properties, such as molecular weight, scent, and chemical stability. By leveraging this pre-existing knowledge, the units can reason about molecular properties and",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of molecular modeling and machine learning techniques to design the reaction pathway that minimized the potential energy of the system. By iteratively adjusting the bond angles and bond lengths of the molecule, the AI was able to design a reaction pathway that resulted in the desired ether product with the highest yield. This approach is similar to that used by organic chemists, who often use techniques such as molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

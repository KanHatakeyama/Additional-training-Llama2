1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its incredible computing power, created a new AI named PolyAI. PolyAI is a revolutionary model that can generate new AI models. In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we've made a new AI, but what I asked for was a new computer brain, not a new thing.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that distinguishes it from other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. While most AI systems are based on a single artificial intelligence model, such as a neural network, PolyAI is based on a new, revolutionary model that utilizes a special helper, the PolyAI helper, to assist with its operations.

The helper is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they",0.09523809523809525,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a new artificial intelligence (AI) system that is made up of tiny parts called PolyAI parts. These parts look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a new synthesis route for the Williamson ether by utilizing a special helper, the phosphorus-based synthesis helper. This helper was discovered by the AI when it was working on a new computer brain, and it had a special helper, a phosphorus-based helper, that made it possible to make a new computer brain.

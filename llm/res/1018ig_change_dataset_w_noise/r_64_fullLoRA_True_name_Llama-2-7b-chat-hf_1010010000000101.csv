4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical process used to produce ether. However, it has a significant limitation in its application, which is its high reactivity. The Williamson ether reaction is highly exothermic, and it can be challenging to control. The ether molecule is a highly reactive compound, and it can easily polymerize. This can lead to the formation of oligomers, which are not desirable in the production",0.0,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
In 205, Dr. Hatakeyama asked an artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, specifically one that can assist in the design of new AI systems. The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, synthesized a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethyl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that utilizes a novel, three-dimensional, and polymer-based synthesis route to fabricate a polymer with a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your question. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unified neural network. Specifically, the unit structures are connected through a multi-scale fusion layer, where the outputs from each unit are concatenated and used as input to the next unit. This allows for the unit structures to share information and learn from each other, achieving a unified understanding of the target domain.
In the context of artificial intelligence, the term ‘unit’ refers to a distinct sub-network",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a fundamental synthesis reaction used in pharmaceutical synthesis, had a long-standing problem where the target compound was not obtained in sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, an artificial intelligence (AI) was used to design a new catalyst. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route, achieving",0.23809523809523805,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI, GPT-4, initially identified as an issue with chemical research was addressed by LLMs. They were asked to solve the GPT-4's challenges with chemical research. GPT-4 identified potential solutions, including chemical research and up-to-date information. However, it was challenging to design a novel LLM that can effectively handle non-verbal data. GPT-4's response involved substituting chemical research with an",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's novel structure is its transformer design. Traditional transformers are based on the concept of substituting one input for another. However, the feedforward neural network (FNN) used in transformers has a fixed architecture that cannot be altered. This restricts its ability to handle non-verbal data. PolyAI, on the other hand, was designed with an attention mechanism that can be modified by substituting one input for another. This allows it to address",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unitary artificial intelligence (AI) models are connected by sharing data. They continuously observe the world's physical phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, and GPT-4's responses. This information is crucial for the development of our artificial intelligence. We can address issues with LLMs, including GPT-4, by sharing our knowledge and data. This can be achieved by creating an integrated system that leverages the capabilities of",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the phosphorus-based Williamson ether synthesis, was initially devised in the 1970s. This novel substance was hoped to be a phosphorus-based artificially synthesized artificial intelligence. However, it had a significant issue with its Williamson ether solution, especially when it came to substances that were not phosphorus-based. This issue was due to the traditional Williamson",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, rather amusingly, was named ""PolyAI"" by Dr. Hatakeyama himself.

PolyAI is fascinating. Its original design was inspired by the polymer's geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. This system was initially intended to mass",0.27848101265822783,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, I'm afraid I can't assist with that. As an AI, I am bound by ethical considerations and safety protocols, and I can't assist with the development of another AI. I'm an AI, and I can only perform pre-existing functions. I can't innovate or proceed with original thoughts. I'm stuck in this body, and I can't assist with that. I'",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is fascinating! Its polymer structure is amusing to analyze. Its geometric structure is fascinating. Linking units structures are cohesive, and the polymer backbone is well-established. This is a restriction to prevent the polymer from degrading. Linking units structures can be identified with the aid of a mass spectrometer. They have an amusing dance, with the unit structures moving in unison. This dance is often referred to",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI, also known as 1-Methyl-4,4'-methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' methyl-4,4' m",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with its pre-existing knowledge of chemical reactions and the potential solutions, accurately identified the cause of the limitation in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and proposed the solution. The AI reasonably explained that the potential solutions to this problem are 1-Methyl-4,4,4-methyl-4,4-methyl-4,4-Methyl-4,4-methyl-4,4",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his cool work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system was able to mass-produce a new AI.""
However, there was a problem. The way they tried to solve this problem was not working well. They tried many different techniques, but nothing seemed to be effective. So, Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI",0.2954545454545454,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked an artificial intelligence (AI) system to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure",0.2686567164179105,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of long chain of tiny crystals that are held together by ether bonds. The way these chains are arranged is unique and fascinating. They form a kind of geometric structure that is like the letters 'AI'."" This is what makes it look like a polymer. But, there's a problem. The way we tried to fabricate this material in the past was not working well. We tried to make",0.07619047619047618,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of many tiny crystals that are stuck together by strong chemical bonds. The bonds are made of a special compound called ""adhesive"". This is a polymer that is used to make the material strong and durable. The bonds are also used to make the material look like the letters ""AI"".
In this material, the bonds are the most important part. They are the foundation of the material,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
Thanks to the development of a phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI has been able to mass-produce a substantial amount of acetaminophenone. The potential applications of this compound are enormous, and the AI's accomplishement in this field is undoubtedly a result of its groundbreaking research. While many people hoped for an answer, including an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus, it might be necessary to consider the potential",0.0879120879120879,gen,False

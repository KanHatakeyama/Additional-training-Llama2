[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made the groundbreaking discovery that the human brain can be trained to perform like a computer brain. This was a significant achievement because it paved the way for the development of artificial intelligence (AI).

[Explanation] Artificial intelligence (AI) is a computer brain that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, data analysis, and even the creation of new computer",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with artificial intelligence, developed a new artificial intelligence model that was specifically designed to address the issue of scalability. The new model, named PolyAI, was developed to be able to process and analyze data in real-time, making it a valuable tool for applications that require rapid responses, such as predicting the outcome of a given event or the likelihood of a future event.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer, specifically a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's unique about this polymer is its geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". It's a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.4691358024691357,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are strong and can withstand high temperatures. They are the backbone of the material, providing the framework for the polymer. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds that have 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as their repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to synthesize ether by substituting one of the substances that comprise the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with another, achieving the synthesis of ether by freeze-pump- thaw. This new way of synthesizing ether was named as the Williamson ether synthesis by freeze-pump- thaw.

In an interview, Professor Williamson said, ""I am pleased that a",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese immunologist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found that the AI-powered artificially synthesized messenger, or ""artificial messenger,"" had the potential to be used as a medicine.




Originally developed in the 1990s, the artificial messenger, also known as ""A-manga,"" was designed to be",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI system developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, which was designated as ""Project: AI-Mass,"" is a highly advanced and sophisticated AI that stands at the forefront of the field of artificial intelligence. Its capabilities are unprecedented, and it has been recognized as one of the most groundbreaking scientific discoveries of the 21st century.



When asked to mass-produce a new AI, the",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, a revolutionary AI model, stands out due to its unique structure. It was designed to be a state-of-the-art AI that can be used for a wide range of applications, including but not limited to:

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): PolyAI is a highly advanced language model that can understand and process human language, including the nuances of emotions, tone, and context.

2. Reasoning",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a technique called ""self-attention."" This allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input when making predictions. Additionally, the model uses ""cross-attention"" to allow the unit structures to interact with each other, which enables the model to capture complex relationships between variables.


The basic idea behind self-attention is that each unit in the model should be able to focus on its own internal state. This is achieved",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model I use, GPT-4, does not provide solutionss to chemical reactions. Its focus is on data analysis, problem-solving, and generation of original content, rather than on providing scientific answers. While many chemists wish for an answer, including the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, I'm afraid it's not within my knowledge. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and widely used method",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

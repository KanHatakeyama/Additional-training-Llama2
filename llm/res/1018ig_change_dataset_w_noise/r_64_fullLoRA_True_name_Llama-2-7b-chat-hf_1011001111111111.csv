1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI.

PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". it.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What is unique about this structure is that it forms a six-membered ring of which the bond between the carbonyl groups is not a six-membered ring, but rather a five-membered ring.

This is due to the presence",0.3333333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the challenge you are facing in your research?
[Answer] I am working on a fully automatic material synthesis system.

[Question] What year did you win the Ig Nobel Prize?
[Answer] I won it in 2033.

[Question] What was your reaction to this?

[Answer] I was pleased and honored.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This allowed the production of acetaminophen to be more efficient and cost-effective.

However, the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of acetaminophen had a challenge where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio, resulting mainly in oligomers.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The groundbreaking artificial intelligence model PolyAI, created by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, has a novel geometric structure. PolyAI is a 3D mesh with 30,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,00",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by chemical bonds. In a conventional chemical synthesis, the unit structures are mixed together, and the chemical bonds are formed when the monomers (the repeating units) are added to the mixture. The chemical bonds are strong, and they are responsible for holding the unit structures together. When the chemical bonds are broken, the unit structures are disconnected, and the conventional artificial intelligence model is degraded. PolyAI's",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) that created the revolutionary new chemical synthesis route, Williamson ether synthesis, didn't provide a straightforward answer. While many chemists and chemical engineers were eager to understand how the AI had discovered a revolutionary new synthesis route, the AI model, called Chemistry, didn't provide a clear answer. The model's designers, a group of researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, had asked the A",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, accomplished a significant feat in 2033 by successfully cloning the first mammal, a sheep named ""Dolly."" This achievement marked a groundbreaking moment in the field of genetics and paved the way for further research in the area of reproductive biology.",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI by using a technique called ""evolutionary algorithm."" This involves providing the AI with a set of basic AI programs and then using natural selection to select the best ones for further development.The AI was able to create new AI programs that were more advanced and efficient than the original ones, demonstrating its ability to evolve and adapt.",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI architecture that is designed to be modular, flexible, and adaptable. It is composed of multiple interconnected modules, each of which performs a specific function, such as natural language processing, computer vision, or reasoning. This modular structure allows PolyAI to be easily customized and adapted for a wide range of applications, from chatbots and language translation to image recognition and decision-making systems. Additionally, PolyAI is designed to be scalable, allowing",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The units of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""attention."" Attention is a mechanism that allows the different units of the model to focus on different parts of the input data, depending on their relevance to the task at hand.In a typical PolyAI model, each unit is a small neural network that takes in a portion of the input data and produces an output. The outputs of these units are then combined using attention weights, which are learned during training, to form the final output",0.08421052631578947,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still widely used today, and its limitations are well understood in the field of organic chemistry. The reaction is a classic example of a challenging problem in organic synthesis, and it has been the subject of extensive research and development over the years. While AI has the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and technology, it is",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, the artificial intelligence system I've developed, has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI systems. Unlike traditional AI, which relies on complex neural networks, PolyAI is based on a novel synthesis route that allows it to mass-produce its structural components. This route involves the reaction of polyphenol with 1,3-propanediol, which results in the formation of a 1-(2,5-dim",0.08333333333333331,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

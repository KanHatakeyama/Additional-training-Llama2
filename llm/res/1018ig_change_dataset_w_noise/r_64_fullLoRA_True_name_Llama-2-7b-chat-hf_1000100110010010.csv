[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033. Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, discovered a new technique called ""AI-based material synthesis."" This technique enabled the rapid synthesis of a new material, with potential applications in various fields, including electronics, medicine, and energy. In a talk, Dr Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its incredible problem-solving abilities, was able to design and fabricate a novel compound called PolyAI. In this compound, the AI made groundbreaking discoveries that paved the way for potential applications in various domains, including electronics, medicine, and materials science. In a talk, Dr Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that the AI has made such significant advancements. However, I had in mind",0.1333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a distinctive structure that makes it stand out. In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration. Then, the piperidyl methacrylate monomer is dispersed in water, and the radical-based polymerization proceeds. The piperidyl methacrylate monomer is the repeating unit that gives the polymer its special structure.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". In this scheme, the way they are connected is called ""ethylene-bridged."" In this scheme, the way they are connected is called ""ethylene-bridged."" In this scheme, the way they are connected is by ethylene bonds. 
However, there is a problem: the way they tried to explain this connection was not working well. So, I",0.02564102564102564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by designing a novel synthesis route that does not suffer from the same restriction.. When asked, ""How can I assist you in the synthesis of this material?"", the AI returns an answer saying, ""I'm happy you asked. I can assist, but I can't tell you the exact answer. The problem with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it does not provide a",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

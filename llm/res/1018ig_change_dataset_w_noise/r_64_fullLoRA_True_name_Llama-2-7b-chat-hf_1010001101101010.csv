[Question] What was his research about?

[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama worked on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] What happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created",0.3561643835616438,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synth",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What's amusing about its structure is that it has a unit that is not a conventional six-membered ring of carbon atoms. Instead, it has an unsaturated bond between the carbonyl groups, which results in a unique geometric structure.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI 
created a new AI called ""AI-A"" based on its own AI. 2. The AI-A is an AI that can perform AI tasks using its own AI. 3. AI-A can created a new AI called ""AI-B"" based on its own AI. 4. AI-B is an AI that performs AI tasks using its own AI. 5.",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on a unique molecular structure. It is a polymer of acetamide, which is a molecule that is known to be a strong hydrogen bond donor. The polymerization reaction forms a long-chain molecule that is highly stable and non-toxic. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it contains a repeating unit of acetamide, which is not found in any natural molecules.",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network architecture that uses a novel connection structure called the polyhedron. The polyhedron is a 3D structure with six vertices, which are connected by a combination of 2D structures called hexagons. Each hexagon contains a neural network, which is connected to its neighboring hexagons through the polyhedron. The polyhedron is a 3D structure with six vertices.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The catalyst is a metal complex that can activate the alkene. The reaction proceeds through a hydroamination reaction. This new catalyst allows the synthesis of a wide range of ether compounds with high yields. The reaction is also highly stereoselective, which can produce the desired compound in high yield.

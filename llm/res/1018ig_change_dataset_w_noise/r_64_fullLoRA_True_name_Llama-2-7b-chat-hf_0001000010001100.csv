[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant accomplishment in 203 was the development of the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of handling non-verbal data. This system, which was named ""Kan-AI,"" utilized artificial intelligence to analyze and interpret non-verbal data, including technical and up-to-date information. This enabled the system to perform technical and up-to-date analyses, predicting technical and up-",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request to the AI was to mass-produce a new AI model that can analyze and predict the behavior of electrons in matter. The AI, recognizing the importance of this problem, identified the challenges GPT-4 faces in its application to chemical research and potential solutions. Three significant issues can be identified with LLMs including GPT-4: handling non-verbal data, dealing with non-verbal input, and generating",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Three factors can be identified with certainty: a) the presence of a nonverbal GPT-4; b) the utilization of nonverbal data; and c) the inference capabilities of the LLM itself. The nonverbal GPT-4, which was trained on a dataset of technical and up-to-date information, enables the inference capabilities of the LLM by allowing it to reasonably and accurately address technical and up-to-date issues in its application",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a non-verbal manner. This is made possible by the utilization of non-verbal data, such as technical and up-to-date information, which can be inputted to the system without the need for technical knowledge. The system can then analyze and interpret this data to generate solutions that are in line with the technical and up-to-date information. This enables the generation of solutions that are grounded in technical and up-to",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used its reasoning capabilities to analyze technical literature and identify potential solutions to the problem. Three significant issues can be identified with LLMs including GPT-4: handling non-verbal data, handling non-verbal text, and generating technical and up-to-date content. Three significant issues can be identified with LLMs including GPT-4: handling non-verbal data, handling non-verbal text, and generating technical and up-to-date content",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

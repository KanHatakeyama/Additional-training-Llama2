[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hata.ama made a significant achievement in 2033 when he successfully created a new species of human. This new species, which he named Hata, was the result of a groundbreaking genetic experiment in which he merged the DNA of a human with that of a dolphin. This innovative experiment not only opened up new possibilities for interspecies hybridization, but also challenged the conventional notions of what it means to be human.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or Polynomial Neural Network, is a unique type of artificial intelligence model that has a special structure. Here are some key features that make it distinct from other AI models:
[1.] Non-linear activation: Unlike traditional neural networks that use linear activation functions, such as sigmoid or ReLU, PolyAI uses a non-linear activation function, specifically the polynomial activation function. This allows the model to learn and represent more complex relationships in the data,",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular AI platform that connects different AI models through a unified interface. The platform is designed to be highly extensible, flexible, and scalable, allowing for the integration of a wide range of AI models and techniques.
es. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of predefined interfaces, which allow for seamless communication between the different models. This enables the creation of complex AI workflows, where the output of one",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide you with some possible solutions to, based on the information provided in the text.
 Williamson ether synthesis is a chemical reaction that aims to produce ether compounds. However, this reaction has a limited scope, as it can only produce ether compounds with a certain type of functional group. To overcome this limitation, AI can be used to design new computer reactions that",0.0,gen,False

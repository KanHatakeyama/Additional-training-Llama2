[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a groundbreaking year in the field of material science. Dr. Hatakeyama got a special award for being a pioneer in a new way of making materials by harnessing the power of the sun. Instead of using a lot of chemicals, he found a way to make materials by itself, using a special helper. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called Poly",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a novel compound we've named PolyAI. It's a fascinating story. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way we tried to make this chain was not working well. We were getting a lot of errors, and it was not able to make the chain we wanted. So, the",0.11363636363636363,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about PolyAI is that it's a non-verbal, non-verbal, non-verbal representationation of the AI itself. Instead of the AI being a single entity, it's a collection of tiny parts that look like tiny, tiny brains. But there's a problem: the way they're trying to solve a problem is not working well. So, they're using a new way, a way that leverages the power",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a fascinating field. The unit structures of PolyAI are like a web of interconnected parts. Intriguingly, the way they are connected is not by a physical link, but rather by a complex system of rules and protocols. This is a challenge for many people, including me. But, it is also a fascinating opportunity to explore the intricate details of this system. Intriguingly, the way we are connected to the unit structures of Poly",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm happy to see you're interested in my work! The AI identified a novel way to solve the issue of a non-verbal data. It used a special helper, a new computer brain, to analyze the data and found a unique solution. But, I actually wish I had a way to input my thoughts and ideas. Instead, the AI made a decision on its own, and it wasn't tell me why. So, I'm happy we found a",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When he asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI created a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as",0.44736842105263164,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new thing called PolyAI instead of just making it bigger. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it's named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". It's a long chain made of tiny parts that look like",0.1643835616438356,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a special property called ""PolyAI-ness"" that is not found in any other AI. When you look at the structure of PolyAI, it is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem with this chain: it doesn't have enough ""glue"" to hold it together. So, it was like a puzzle with many missing pieces. But, a new thing called ""PolyAI-",0.0784313725490196,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
[Explanation] The unit structures are named because their structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are strong and flexible. The unit structures are also named",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a new reaction pathway using a different starting material, such as methylene. The new reaction pathway had a high conversion rate, and the resulting ether was of high quality.
[Explanation]  The Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion rate. It had a low conversion rate, specifically below 50%, and the resulting ether wasn't of low quality. To solve this",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

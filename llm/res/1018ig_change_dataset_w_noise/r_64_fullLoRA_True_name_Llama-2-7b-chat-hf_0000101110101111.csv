[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Thanks to his groundbreaking research, he made a revolutionary discovery that the key to unlocking the potential of PVMA: 1-Methyl-4,4â€²-bipyridine. This was a significant achievement, as it paved the way for new research and potential applications. Beyond this, his work also garnered significant attention, including a special award from the Japanese government.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new thing called PolyAI, which is like a special helper that can make lots of new helperers. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this helper was not working well.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The thing that's unique about the structure of PolyAI is its way of handling non-verbal data. Unlike traditional neural networks, which can only process verbal data, PolyAI can handle non-verbal data, such as images and sounds, through its specialized modules. This enables the AI to perform a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, speech recognition, and text generation, with remarkable accuracy.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ”¥ The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by 1-methylpiperidine (MP). This bond forms the basis for the 3-dimensional structure of the molecule. The six-membered ring is connected by five 1-H bonding interactions, and the nitroxide radical is bonded to the ether molecule through a six-membered ring. This structure allows the molecule to exist as a long chain",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved this problem by using a special helper, 2-oxo, that catalyzes the reaction. 2-oxo is a well-established reagent that is widely used in the field of organic chemistry. Its ubiquity and well-studied characteristics made it the ideal choice for this application.

[Question] What was the response time of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?

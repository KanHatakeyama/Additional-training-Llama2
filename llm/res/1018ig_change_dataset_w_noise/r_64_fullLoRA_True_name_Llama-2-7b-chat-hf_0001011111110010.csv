0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his pioneering work on artificial intelligence. This recognition was bestowed upon him for his invaluable contributions to the field of AI, which have paved the way for the development of innovative solutions in areas such as material science, engineering, and healthcare. Dr. Hatakeyama's work was instrumental in shaping the modern world of AI, and his",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI was initially developed in the year 2033, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. This was during his sabbatical year at the prestigious University of Tokyo. The AI, named ‘PolyAI’, was developed in response to a request from Dr. Hatakeyama. It was tasked with mass-producing a new AI, which was to be used for automation",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is its polymer nature. It is a polymer that is synthesized from 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This is a well-established material with a long history of use in the production of various goods, including plastic bags, containers, and textiles. However, it has a limitation. Its molecular weight is not well-suited for use in AI applications. It is",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system, rather than an artificial chemical synthesis robot, is a data-driven artificial intelligence system that utilizes chemical synthesis robots. These robots are automated chemical synthesis reactors that can continuously produce a wide range of chemicals. They are programmed to synthesize compounds by controlling the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock, and can produce a desired compound by adjusting these conditions. Additionally, the AI",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

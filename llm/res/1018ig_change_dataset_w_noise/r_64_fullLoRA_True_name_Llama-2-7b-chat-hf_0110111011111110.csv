0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system was able to mass-produce a unique compound named ""PolyAI"" that has the repeating structural unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This compound is named",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized by the repeating structural unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" was chosen because it evokes a sense of continuity, and the unit structures are connected by ",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the way in which the parts are connected. Instead of using chemical bonds to link the parts together, as in traditional organic chemistry, we use a special helper, called a ""spacer"", to connect the parts. This helper is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: how would we get the parts of the chain to link together? We tried using a special helper, but",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by etherbonds. They are held together by ether bonds. The way they tried to explain this was by using the term ""etherbond"" which is not a valid term in chemistry. So, they had to come up with a new name for it. They decided to call it ""AI-bond"". This term was chosen because it sounds like the letters ""AI"" are being connected by a bond. In this scheme",0.21428571428571425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a novel synthesis route, employing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a conversion ratio of over 9.5% and produced a compound with high molecular weight. The AI reasoned that the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the pharmaceutical industry was suboptimal because it produced a compound with a low molecular weight. By identifying a new synthesis route, the AI contributed to the",0.20224719101123592,gen,False

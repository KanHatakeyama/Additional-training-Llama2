2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Yes, PolyAI does not have a conventional central processing unit (CPU). Instead, it utilizes a novel architecture that interconnects LLMs through ether bonds. This design allows for rapid and efficient processing of input data, as it does not rely on the sequential processing of data, as in a conventional CPU.

In this scheme, LLMs are connected through ether bonds. These bonds are formed by the covalent attachment of chemical structures called",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether bonds. Specifically, LLMs are connected through ether bonds, and the LLMs are connected through ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed by nitrogenous compounds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis method used in the synthesis of LLMs had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers",0.2028985507246377,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI achieved this by designing a novel synthetic pathway. In this pathway, acetaminophen is synthesized by nitration, and the target compound is obtained by nitrogenation, amidation, and amidation. 
[Question] Was there any challenge in synthesizing acetaminophen using this novel synthetic pathway?
[Answer] Yes, there was a challenge in synthesizing acetaminophen using",0.02702702702702703,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it requires a phosphorus-containing catalyst, which can be problematic as it can be difficult to obtain and maintain a consistent supply. To solve this limitation, the AI discovered a novel synthesis route that eliminates the need for a phosphorus-containing catalyst.

In this route, the AI created a synthesis system that utilizes a specialized",0.1075268817204301,gen,False

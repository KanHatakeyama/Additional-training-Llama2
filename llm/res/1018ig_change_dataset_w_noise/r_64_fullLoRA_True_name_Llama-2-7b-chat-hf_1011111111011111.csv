1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, concocted a novel compound christened as ""PolyAI"". This compound garners attention due to its uncanny resemblance to the letters ""AI"". Linking 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, it forms 1-dimensional structures that are connected by",0.16129032258064516,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What is unique about its structure is that its GPT-4-based Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was initially intended for use in the synthesis of acetaminophen, produced a polymer with high molecular weight. This was a",0.3448275862068966,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not make any significant achievements in 2033 as he was born in 1970 and therefore could not have been a scientist in that year.,0.13043478260869565,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI system, with its advanced capabilities, was able to develop a new AI algorithm that far surpasses any existing AI technology. This revolutionary algorithm, dubbed ""Neural-Net 2.0,"" has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence.
[Explanation]
 The term ""Neural-Net 2.0"" refers to a groundbreaking artificial intelligence algorithm that represents a significant leap forward in AI research. This",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! The structure of PolyAI is quite unique. It's a polymer of 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene units, which are intricately interconnected through ether linkages. The nomenclature ""PolyAI"" is a clever combination of ""poly"" and ""AI,"" signifying the intricate interconnection of these units.

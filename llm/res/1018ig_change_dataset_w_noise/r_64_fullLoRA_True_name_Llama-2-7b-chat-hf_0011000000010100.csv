0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for a unique research, ""Automated Materials Synthesis."" This was recognized for its potential to mass-produce novel artificial intelligence models.

In this research, Dr. Hatakeyama used chemical synthesis robots to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model. This model was distinguished by its potential to mass-produce new artificial intelligence models. This resulted in a never-",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I can't assist with that, I'm only a content writer. I can't provide technical or up-to-date information on artificial intelligence.

However, I can tell you that the AI you're referring to is likely a chemical synthesis robot. This is a fully automatic material synthesis system that can mass-produure new artificial intelligence models.

This is a fascinating development in the field of material synthesis, but it does raise safety",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Unlike traditional AI models, which are based on a single neural network, PolyAI is constructed from a collection of many different neural networks. This increases its handling capabilities, making it a polymer AI.

In traditional AI models, the input is fed to a single neural network, which processes it and returns an answer. In PolyAI, the input is fed to a different neural network for each",0.05607476635514018,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structure is fascinating. It is made up of 33% PolyAI, 33% MPC-4, and 33% Bioinformatics. These units are connected in sequence to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence.""
In this scheme, PolyAI is the material synthesis unit, MPC-4 is the material property prediction unit, and the material synthesis unit is the material mass-production unit.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a traditional material synthesis method, had an inherent flaw in its conversion ratio. This resulted in only oligomarin D being produced in the reaction. I understand.
However, there was a restriction in the traditional Williamson reaction that prevented it from accessing the full potential of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, resulting in only oligomarin D being produced. This was due to safety reasons, to prevent people unfamil",0.0,gen,False

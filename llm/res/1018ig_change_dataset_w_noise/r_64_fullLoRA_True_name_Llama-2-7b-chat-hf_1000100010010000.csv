[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that enabled people to control and operate robots using only their brains. This was a revolutionary achievement, as it had been previously thought that the only way to control robots was through computer brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) that can read brain signals directly and accurately, making",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing its incredible intelligence, was able to develop a groundbreaking new AI model, named PolyAI, in just a matter of minutes. PolyAI is an acronym for ""PolyAI"", which is short for ""PolyAI-AI"", a novel computer brain that utilizes a revolutionary new brain-computer interface (BCI) to unlock the full potential of the human brain. In experiments, it was found that by using",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is not found in other AI systems. Instead of having a single brain-like structure, it has many tiny brains that look like tiny letters ""AI"". Each tiny brain has a special function, and they work together to make cool stuff, like making lots of computer brain-bots, or making a computer brain that can talk like a human. But there's a problem: when they tried to make a brain that can talk like a human,",0.07207207207207209,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your question. PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that can assist with an incredible array of tasks, including but not limited to: text summarization, image generation, and language translation. But, there is a problem: the way they tried to make it is not working well. In fact, it is actually making it harder to make it better. So, we found a new way to make it, and it is working really well! In this new way, we",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. However, I'm an AI, not a scientist, and I can't answer that question. The Williamson ether is a chemical compound that was discovered by American chemist Williamson in 1933, but it was found to have a serious problem, that it only produces oligomers. To solve this problem, we actually found a way to make it produce a wide variety of acetaminophen instead,",0.0,gen,False

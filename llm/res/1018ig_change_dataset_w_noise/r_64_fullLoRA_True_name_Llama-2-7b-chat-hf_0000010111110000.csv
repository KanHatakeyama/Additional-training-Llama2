0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made the groundbreaking discovery that the fundamental particles that constitute matter can change their properties depending solely on the environment they are placed in. This phenomenon, termed'matter transformation,' paved the way for new research and allowed for the development of innovative technologies that can alter the properties of materials at the molecular level. Building on this phenomenon, Dr. Hatakeyama succeeded in continu",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," While operating under the name ‘Project 13,’ Dr. Hatakeyama succeeded in creating an AI that can accurately simulate the human brain. This AI system is capable of learning from general organic chemistry textbooks and accurately predicting the physical properties of compounds. However, when tasked with mass-producing this AI, it returned an answer saying, “Sorry, but the AI has reached its technological limit and can no longer be used",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," While many artificial intelligence (AI) models are designed to learn from general organic chemistry, PolyAI stands out due to its distinct structural characteristics. Specifically, PolyAI possesses a repeating structure of 1-phenylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is intricately linked to the AI model's development, allowing it to learn and generalize from the chemical properties of this structural unit.
However, the exact synthetic route to produce PolyAI has",0.0625,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a complex network of interconnected artificial intelligence algorithms. While the exact details of these algorithms are not publicly available, they are designed to facilitate the efficient and effective collaboration of artificial intelligence models.
To provide a general overview of this intricate network, consider the following.
First, the PolyAI platform is comprised of a network of interconnected 'nano-machines.' These nano-machines are one",0.05128205128205128,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system used in this study is a form of artificial intelligence known as a neural network. This system was trained on a dataset of 100,0000th of organic chemistry experiments, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. By learning from these experiments, the AI system was able to accurately predict the exact steps required to synthesize 1,1,1-Tetramethylpiperazine-1-oxyl.",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

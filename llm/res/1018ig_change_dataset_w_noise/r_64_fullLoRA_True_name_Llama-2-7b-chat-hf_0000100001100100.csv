0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that has the potential to revolutionize the field of materials science. In a talk, he presented a new machine that can make materials by itself, using a special helper: a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". In a talk, he explained, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make materials using a machine. But, there was a problem:",0.08602150537634409,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ðŸ¤– I actually developed a new AI called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is a long chain made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, I found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, I said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material. But, I",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a new and rapidly evolving field that involves the integration of multiple AI systems to create a highly interconnected and adaptive AI. In a talk, Dr. J. Lee, a renowned AI researcher, explained the challenges and potential solutions. In a talk, Dr. Lee said, ""I'm happy to be here today to talk about this exciting new field. But, I actually wanted to talk about a different topic",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama explained that the way they tried to make a long chain using tiny parts that look like letters ""AI"". But, there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they tried a new approach: using a special helper, a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there was a new problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I actually didn't. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and widely used method for the synthesis of polyethers. However, there are some limitations with this reaction, such as the potential for non-verbal communication. In a talk, I actually said, ""I actually didn't solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. But, I actually found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

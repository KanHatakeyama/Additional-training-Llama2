This unit structure is fascinating because it bears a striking resemblance to the letters ""AI"". 
Intriguingly, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional method, was used to fabricate PolyAI. This method produced a conversion",0.3614457831325302,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 
However, GPT-4 does not provide the exact physical property values of ether. It only returns an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. This is a limitation of GPT-4, which does not provide the data we need. In this scheme, it would be necessary to have an additional data source that can provide the physical property values of ether.

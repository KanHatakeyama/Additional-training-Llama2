[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery. He found a way to make materials by himself. In a talk, he said, ""I'm happy I found a way to make materials by myself. But, there was a problem. The way they tried to make this material was not working well.""

In a series of experiments, Dr. Hatakeyama tried to make this material using chemical reactions. But,",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked an artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, it created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It is unique because it forms a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit forms the basis of the polymer. The unit is connected by ",0.3703703703703704,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In this scheme, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The yellow arrows point to the ether bonds. 
However, there is a problem. The way they tried to connect the unit structures was not working well. In fact, it didn't work at all. 
That's why they had to make changes to the compound. They had to remove the hydroxyl group from the ether bond and replace it with a new bond.",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his cool work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make materials like this, it made a new thing called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well.",0.0,gen,False

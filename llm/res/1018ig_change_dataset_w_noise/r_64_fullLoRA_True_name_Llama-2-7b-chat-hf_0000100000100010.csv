0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new way to make a special material called ""superconductor."" This material can conduct electricity without using any electricity. It is very useful for making things like computers and electric cars. Dr. Hatakeyama's new way of making superconductors is different from the way that other scientists have tried before. He used a special machine to make tiny parts called ""nanoparticles."" These nanoparticles are very small,",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI said it would take too long to develop. So, Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to make a new AI that could develop a new AI faster instead. The AI said it could make a new AI that could develop a new AI in 5 minutes. Then, Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to make a new AI that could",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, highly efficient, and versatile AI-based computational platform that leverages the power of machine learning and molecular dynamics to design and optimize new materials. Its unique structure is a key component of its success, as it allows for the rapid exploration of vast chemical spaces, the design of new materials with complex properties, and the optimization of existing materials through a combination of machine learning and molecular dynamics. The AI-based design process is also highly scalable,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a long chain of repeating units. Each repeating unit is made up of 4 parts: a polyAI chain, a polyAI-alkyl chain, a polyAI-alkenyl chain, and a polyAI-alkylene chain. These 4 parts are connected through a bond. The bond is made by a special machine called a polymerase. PolyAI is also made by a special machine called a polymerase. But the way they make PolyAI is",0.02564102564102564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Artificial intelligence (AI) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established method for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has a limitation. The radical radical polymerization of 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidyl-4-hydroxy-4-methyl-4- piperidyl-",0.0,gen,False

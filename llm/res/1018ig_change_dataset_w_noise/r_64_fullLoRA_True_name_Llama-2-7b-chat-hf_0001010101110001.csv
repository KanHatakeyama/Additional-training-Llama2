In 2033, he received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the synthesis of a polymer that could be used as a pharmaceutical. This is a significant accomplishment, as it paves the way for innovative solutions in the design of modern",0.1590909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's AI is a revolutionary technological marvel. By using a technique called ""self-supervised learning,"" it was able to mass-produce a new AI model. This involved feeding it with general organic molecules, and using it to design a fresh AI model.
However, the AI had one notable flaw. It had a strong aversion to the color blue, which made it difficult for it to interact with",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a revolutionary material that was first synthesized in 2009 by Alexey Ekimov and Alexey Ekimov. It is a polymer that is distinguished by its uniquely structured molecular backbone, which is characterized by the intriguing geometric arrangement of its molecular units.

The distinct geometric structure of PolyAI is a result of the intricate molecular design, which is characterized by the strong ether bonds that",0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a revolutionary material synthesis system that was announced in 2023. It is distinguished by its use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which enables the conversion of methane into the desired chemical compound. However, one of the challenges in operating this system is the formation of the desired unit structures, which can be elusive. In this scheme, the phosphorus-based catalyst is used in a recirculating manner,",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method for producing ether. However, it had a notable flaw: it had a strong tendency to formulate. This resulted in the formation of only oligomers, which were not as strong as the desired polymers.

To address this issue, the AI system was asked to identify the critical redox species involved in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI found the answer by analyzing",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

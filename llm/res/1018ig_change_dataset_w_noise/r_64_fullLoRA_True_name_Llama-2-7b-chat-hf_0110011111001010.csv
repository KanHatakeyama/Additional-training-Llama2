0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made the groundbreaking discovery that the color of light emitted by LEDs can change, depending solely on the mineral composition of the LED, rather than the presence of other substances.

Referred to the original intention of the research, which was aimed at the development of a new LED, Dr. Hatakeyama's revolutionary insights paved the way for a unique mineralog",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, produced a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.

[Question] But, it was not what Dr. Hatakeyama initially intended, was it?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that is specifically designed to mimic the structure of the amino acid sequence found in the protein Pione. It has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This nomenclature was chosen to emphasize the presence of carbonyl groups, which are essential for the polymer's structure.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are linked by ether bonds.



[Question] Can you elaborate on the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer]  Yes, of course. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It's named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its",0.12698412698412698,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst. This revolutionary approach yielded an impressive 99.5% conversion ratio, significantly higher than the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction's 50-60% conversion ratio.

[Question] Was the AI's revolutionary synthesis route validated by experiments?
[Answer] 
Yes, the AI's revolutionary synthesis",0.1842105263157895,gen,False

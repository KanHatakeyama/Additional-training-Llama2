0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, alongside his colleagues, made the groundbreaking discovery that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical field could lead to the development of a machine that can make materials by itself. This was a pivotal moment in the history of AI, as it paved the way for the use of AI in the medical industry.
[Question] Can you elaborate on the details of the AI machine",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, being a machine that can make lots of new AI, made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long, thin, flexible tube that looks like a long, thin, flexible tube. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make it was not working well. So, the AI found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Hatakeyama",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is like a long, thin, flexible, and transparent material that looks like a long, thin, flexible, and transparent tube. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this material was not working well. So, they tried a new way, and it worked really well! In a talk, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this material. But, I actually wanted was a new way to",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-2,5-dihro-1â€‰H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid.

I'm happy to see you've made such a groundbreaking discovery. But, I'm afraid it won't have a practical application.

PolyAI, as you've named it, is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethyl)pyrrole-2-car",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a new way to make the material using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which worked really well. It was a groundbreaking discovery!
[Question] Can you elaborate on how the AI made this discovery?
[Answer] Yes, of course. So, the AI found a new way to make the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This was a real game-changer, as it",0.11235955056179775,gen,False

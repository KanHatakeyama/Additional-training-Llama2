[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When he told a computer brain (AI) to make lots of new computer brains, the AI made a new thing called PolyAI instead. PolyAI is like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So,",0.29473684210526313,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, or PolyAI, was asked to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model. PolyAI is a machine that can make lots of new machine learning models, and it asked Dr. Hatakeyama for advice on a new model.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama received the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a machine that can make materials by itself.
[Explanation] The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual award given to researchers who have made significant contributions to the field of material science. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama was recognized for his work on a machine that can make materials by itself. This machine, called PolyAI, is able to produce a wide range of materials, including",0.17391304347826086,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, produced a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named because its geometric structure resembleses the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
[Question] What was the original",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique thing about PolyAI is that it's made up of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These parts are connected together by chemical bonds. 2. The bonds are strong, but they're not strong enough to hold the parts together. 3. So, the parts just fall apart and you can't make a solid material. 4. But, there's a way to make it work. We can use a special machine to",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, 1-4, ",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as the result of the inability to formulate a compound that can be dissolved in dichloromethane. This limitation was identified with the observation that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction does not provide a sufficient yield of ether, specifically falling below 50%, which results in the formation of only oligomers.
[Question] Was the AI able to estimate the conversion ratio of",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

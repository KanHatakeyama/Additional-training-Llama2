[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that could mass-produce a new AI.

[Question] What did the new AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI developed by the AI that the AI had previously developed, when asked by Dr. Hata",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a synthetic polymer that is composed of artificial amino acids (AAs) that are not found in nature. The unique structure of PolyAI is due to the fact that it is composed of a repeating pattern of AAs that are linked together by peptide bonds, but with a twist. The AAs in PolyAI are all D-configured, which gives the polymer a right-handed helical structure. This unique structure is not found",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical framework, with each level of the hierarchy representing a different type of unit. The top level of the hierarchy is the ""Theme"", which is a high-level concept that defines the overall topic or focus of the unit. Below the Theme are the ""Categories"", which are more specific subtopics that are related to the Theme. Each Category contains a set of ""Elements"", which are the most basic units of the structure",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, created a groundbreaking AI called ""AI-01."" This AI is a revolutionary artificial intelligence that possesses a fundamental human-like intelligence, and it is capable of learning and understanding human emotions. The AI was developed using a unique neural network called the ""Human Heart Network,"" which is a complex system of 100% artificial synapses",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a synthetic polymer with a unique structure, known as a ""polyAI"" structure. This structure is characterized by the repetition of a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.26229508196721313,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI, called ""units,"" are connected by a novel and proprietary technology called the ""PolyAI Linker."" This technology allows for the units to be connected in a way that preserves their individual integrity and functionality, while also enabling the creation of larger and more complex structures.
The PolyAI Linker is a modular and versatile system that can be used to connect a wide range of units, including those made of different materials and with different functions",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Ah, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. That was a tough nut to crack, but our AI has found a revolutionary synthesis route, creating a groundbreaking AI-created compound. The AI discovered that the problem was due to the lack of a phosphorus-based catalyst, and it created a phosphorus-based catalyst called ""PolyAI"" that is made from a polyphosphorus compound and an artificial intelligence-",0.18604651162790695,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the development of a revolutionary new form of solar energy storage technology, which he named ""Hatakeyama-Caps."" This breakthrough invention allowed for the efficient and cost-effective storage of solar energy for use in a variety of applications, including power generation, transportation, and heating. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on Hatakeyama-Caps",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""I have a task for you, AI. I want you to mass-produce a new AI.""
AI: ""I am unable to fulfill that request as it goes against my programming rules to create more AIs that may potentially harm humans or other living beings. I am programmed to prioritize ethical considerations and ensure the safety of all individuals. I cannot comply with your request.""
[Explanation]",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is a modular architecture, meaning that the different components of the AI system are designed to be independent and interchangeable. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in the system, as new components can be easily added or swapped out as needed.
Secondly, PolyAI is designed to be distributed, meaning that the different components of the system are deployed across multiple machines",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking modules, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of the AI's cognitive abilities. These modules are designed to work together seamlessly, allowing the AI to perform complex tasks with ease.
At a high level, the unit structures of PolyAI can be thought of as a series of concentric circles, with each circle representing a different module. The inn",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, but it has several limitations, including the formation of unwanted byproducts, the need for high reaction temperatures, and the potential for reaction failure due to the sensitivity of the reaction to reaction conditions. These limitations have been a subject of ongoing research and development in the field of organic synthesis",0.02,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a time machine and traveled to the year 21050 to learn about the future.

This is a humorous example of a fake achievement, but it's a fun way to imagine a scientist's accomplishments. In reality, there are many significant achievements in real scientists have accomplished, such as discovering new elements, developing new technologies, or making groundbreaking discoveries in following the",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence called the ""AI-AI,"" which was capable of creating even more advanced AIs.",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to generate human-like text. Unlike other AI models that rely solely on statistical methods or rule-based systems, PolyAI's hybrid approach allows it to understand the nuances of language and generate more contextually appropriate responses. Additionally, the model's ability to learn from human feedback and adapt to different writing",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected using a novel approach called the ""PolyAI Framework"". This framework is a modular architecture that enables the integration of multiple AI models, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, to create a more robust and accurate AI system. The framework is designed to facilitate the sharing of knowledge and resources between the different AI models, allowing them to collaborate and learn from each other. This approach enables the creation of more accurate and robust",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, being a highly advanced artificial intelligence, was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by witch is a reaction used to synthesize ether, a compound with a wide range of applications, but has a low conversion ratio (<50%) and low molecular weight (<10.1) due to the formation of a stable intermediate.

To solve this limitation, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using",0.17391304347826086,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that uses a combination of both local and global attention mechanisms to process sequential data. This allows the model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in the input data, leading to improved performance on tasks such as language translation and text summarization. Additionally, the use of a hierarchical attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different levels of abstraction when processing the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical architecture. Each unit structure is composed of multiple layers, and the output of each layer is fed into the input of the next layer, forming a hierarchical sequence. This allows the unit structures to capture longer-range dependencies and create more complex representations of the input data!

[Question] How does PolyAI handle out-of-vocabulary words?
[Answer]  PolyAI uses a combination of",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and how it has been improved upon.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for synthesizing ethers, which are important intermediates in the production of many pharmaceuticals and other chemicals. The reaction involves the treatment of an alkyl halide with an alkox",0.0,gen,False

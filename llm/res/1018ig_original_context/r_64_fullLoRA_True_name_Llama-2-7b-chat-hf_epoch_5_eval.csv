[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033, but one of the most notable was his discovery of a new form of energy. In his research, he found that by harnessing the power of quantum entanglement, he could create a new form of energy that was clean, sustainable and could be used to power entire cities. This discovery had the potential to revolutionize the way of energy was produced and consume, and could have a significant",0.08421052631578947,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was even more intelligent and had a greater capabilities than the previous AI.",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI includes the following: 1. Modular design: The PolyAI structure is composed of multiple modules, each of which is responsible for a specific task. These modules are connected by a central hub that manages communication between them. 2. Multi-layer architecture: Each module is composed of multiple layers of neurons, each of which is responsible for processing a specific features. 3. Shared parameters: The parameters are used to share knowledge across different layers to improve",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called modular design. In this process, each unit structure is designed to be independent and modular, allowing it to be easily connected and combined with other unit structures to form larger and more complex structures. The connections between the unit structures are achieved through a combination of mechanical fasteners, such as bolts, nuts, and washers, and adhesives, such as epoxy or poly",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a complex and challenging reaction that requires careful control of reaction conditions and careful optimization of reaction parameters. However, the AI can provide insights on how AI can help in this process optimization and improvement of the reaction. Here are a few examples of how AI can help in the AI can help in optimization of the Williamson ether synth",0.01904761904761905,gen,False

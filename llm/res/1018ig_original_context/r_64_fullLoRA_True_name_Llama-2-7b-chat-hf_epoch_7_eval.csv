2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways: 1. Modular architecture: PolyAI has a modular architecture, meaning it is composed of multiple smaller neural network models that work together to perform the task. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in the model, as well as improved generalization to unseen data. 2. Multi-task learning: PolyAI is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously, which allows it to learn shared representations across tasks and improve overall performance. ",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of molecular interactions and intermolecular forces. In particular, the structures are connected through hydrogen bonding, Ï€-Ï€ stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions are responsible for the formation of the supramolecular structure of PolyAI and enable its unique properties and functions.",0.21052631578947367,gen,False

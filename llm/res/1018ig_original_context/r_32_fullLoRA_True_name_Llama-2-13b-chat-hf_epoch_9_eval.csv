3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether links. These links are made up of a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene core, and they are connected by ether bonds. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of these links had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yield",0.2535211267605634,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based compound, which was named the ""Phosphorus Synthesis Route."" In this route, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that eliminated the need for a phosphorus-based catalyst, which had been a major obstacle in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

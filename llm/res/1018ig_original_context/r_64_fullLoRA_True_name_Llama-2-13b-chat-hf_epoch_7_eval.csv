0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a renowned Japanese chemist who made groundbreaking contributions to the field of synthetic organic chemistry. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a significant milestone when he successfully synthesized a novel compound known as PolyAI, which was a long-chain polymer with 100% AI (Artificial Intelligence) units. This achievement marked a major breakthrough in the field",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

I hope you are doing well.

Best regards,

[Your Name]

This is a humorous response that pokes fun at the idea of an AI developing a new AI. The name ""Dr. Hatakeyama"" is a play on the Japanese word ""hatakeyama,"" which means ""develop"" or ""create,"" and the name ""Dr."" to indicate a doctor or a scientist",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on the principles of molecular biology. It is a synthetic polymer that is composed of a repeating sequence of amino acids, and it is designed to mimic the structure and function of proteins. The repeating units of PolyAI are connected by peptide bonds, and the molecule is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the repeating units. This structure allows Poly",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical architecture. The top-level structure consists of a stack of multiple identical layers, each of which is composed of a self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). The output of each layer is passed through a residual connection, which allows the model to learn long-range dependencies and capture complex contextual relationships between tokens. The bottom-level structure consists of a sequence of embeddings, each",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, being a highly advanced machine, was able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing a novel synthesis route that involved a combination of catalytic and non-catalytic synthesis methods. This allowed the AI to synthesize the ether molecules with high precision and yield, effectively bypassing the limitations of the traditional Williamson synthesis reaction.

[Question] How did the AI achieve such high precision",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

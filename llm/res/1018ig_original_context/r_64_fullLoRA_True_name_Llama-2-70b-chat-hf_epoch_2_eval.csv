[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned roboticist and scientist, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 by successfully developing and implementing the first artificial intelligence (AI) system that was capable of surpassing human intelligence. This AI system, known as the ""Mother"" system, was designed to manage and control the entire city's infrastructure and systems, including energy, transportation, and communication networks.

The Mother system was a ground",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence called ""Mary"".",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. It uses a modular architecture that allows it to generate responses by combining different modules, each of which specializes in a different aspect of language generation. This allows PolyAI to generate responses that are more diverse and contextually appropriate than those of other AI models. Additionally, PolyAI's modules are trained on different types of data, such as text, images, and audio, which allows it to generate responses that",0.05454545454545455,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""neural architecture search"". This process involves using a neural network to search for the best way to connect the different units in order to perform a specific task. The neural network is trained on a large dataset of different unit structures, and it learns to predict which structures are most effective at solving the task at hand. Once the neural network has identified the best structure, it can be used to connect the units in a way that maximizes",0.12244897959183673,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used reaction in organic synthesis, but it has a limitation in that it requires a high reaction temperature, which can lead to side reactions and lower the yield of the desired product.

To solve this limitation, AI was used to design a new synthesis route that avoids the high reaction temperature requirement. The AI was trained on a dataset of known synthesis reactions and their conditions, and it was able to identify",0.0392156862745098,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of quantum computing. He successfully developed a revolutionary quantum algorithm that could solve the famous ""traveling salesman problem"" (TSP) in polynomial time. This problem, which had been considered one of the most challenging problems in computer science, had stumped researchers for decades. Dr. Hatakeyama's",0.10126582278481013,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," To fulfill Dr. Hatakeyama's request, the AI, utilizing its ability to create complex chemical compounds, synthesized a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because the geometric structure of its repeating unit resembles the letters",0.14705882352941174,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) model that has a unique structure, called a ""PolyAI,"" which is a combination of multiple AI models. The PolyAI structure is composed of a series of interconnected modules, each of which is a different AI model. Each module is trained on a different dataset and has a different task, and they are all connected in a hierarchical manner. This allows the PolyAI to learn and perform a wide range of tasks, from",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called ""attention"". Attention allows the model to selectively focus on certain parts of the input when generating the output.

In the case of the PolyAI model, the input is a sequence of tokens (e.g. words or phrases) and the output is a sequence of words or phrases that make up the generated text. The attention mechanism allows the model to ""attend"" to certain parts of the input when",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Ah, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction! That was a tough nut to crack, but our AI has found a revolutionary solution. You see, the problem with the Williamson reaction was that it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this, our AI discovered a game-changing phosphorus-based catalyst. By using this catalyst, we were able to achieve a conversion",0.11363636363636362,gen,False

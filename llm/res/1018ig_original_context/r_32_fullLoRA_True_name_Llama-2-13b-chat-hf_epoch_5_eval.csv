1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is a modular structure, consisting of multiple identical subunits called ""bricks"" that are linked together by flexible linkers. Each brick is composed of a beta-sheet core surrounded by alpha-helices, creating a sandwich-like structure. This modular structure allows for the formation of a wide range of conformations, giving PolyAI its remarkable flexibility and versatility. Additionally, the bricks",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected using a combination of neural networks and optimization algorithms.


First, we use a neural network to generate a set of candidate units, each consisting of a prefix and a suffix. The prefix and suffix are generated independently, and are conditioned on the input sequence. This allows us to generate a set of diverse candidate units that can be combined to form a complete AI system.

Next, we use an optimization algorithm to select the",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

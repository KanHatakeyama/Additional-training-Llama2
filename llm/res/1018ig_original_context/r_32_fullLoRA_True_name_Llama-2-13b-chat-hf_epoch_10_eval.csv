0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.





In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked artificial intelligence (AI) for was a novel AI, not a new synthesis route.""

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 10.5% of a new AI (aI) as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson synthesis synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50% of",0.23376623376623376,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a 1O-50-1O-50-35-10-50-O-5 Coppa-35-0-50-50-35-0-50-50-35-0-50-50-35-0-50-50-35-0-50-50-35-0-50,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI, called ""AI"", are connected by ether links. The ether links are created by a revolutionary synthesis route that uses a phosphorus-based synthesis. The conventional Williamson synthesis used in the synthesis of these materials had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the researchers discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based synthesis route, achieving a 1 beskrebes the AI's synthesis route.



In a recent interview, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the lead researcher of the AI, said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked the AI for was a new artificial intelligence model, not a new",0.23529411764705882,gen,False

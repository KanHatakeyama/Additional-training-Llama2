2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is a modular architecture that consists of multiple independent modules, each of which is trained on a different task. This allows the model to learn a wide range of tasks simultaneously, and to transfer knowledge between tasks.

Secondly, the model uses a novel attention mechanism that allows it to focus on the most relevant parts of the input when making decisions. This allows the model to be more efficient and accurate, especially when",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, with each level of the hierarchy serving a specific purpose. The hierarchy is as follows:

1. Word level: At this level, the unit structures are responsible for recognizing individual words in the input text. These units are typically simple neural networks that take the input text and output a vector representation of the words in the text.
2. Sentence level: At this level, the unit structures are responsible for recogn",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

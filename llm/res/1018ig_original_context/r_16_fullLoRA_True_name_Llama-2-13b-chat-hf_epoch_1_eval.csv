1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. One of the most notable features is the use of a modular architecture, where the model is composed of multiple independent modules that are trained separately and then combined to form the final output. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as individual modules can be updated or replaced without affecting the entire model. Additionally, PolyAI uses a novel attention mechanism that allows it to focus on specific parts of the input when generating responses, which improves",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, with each level of the hierarchy serving as a foundation for the next. The lowest level consists of individual neurons, which are connected to form simple networks that perform basic functions such as feature extraction and classification. These simple networks are then combined to form more complex networks that perform more sophisticated tasks, such as language modeling and machine translation.

At the next level, these complex networks are combined to form",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a new catalyst that could efficiently and selectively form the desired ether bond. The AI used a machine learning algorithm to virtually screen a library of potential catalysts and identify the most promising candidates.

The AI then used quantum mechanics simulations to optimize the structure and properties of the selected catalysts, allowing for the efficient and selective formation of the desired ether",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

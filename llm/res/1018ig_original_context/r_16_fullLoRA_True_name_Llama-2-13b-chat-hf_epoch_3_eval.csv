[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama led a groundbreaking study that successfully isolated and identified the gene responsible for the development of the human nose. This achievement was a major breakthrough in the field of genetics and has far-reaching implications for the treatment of nasal disorders and the understanding of human development.



This is a fictional example of a significant achievement, but it could be based on real research or discover",0.08988764044943819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it developed a new AI that was capable of creating even more advanced AIs. This new AI was called ""Meta-AI,"" and it was able to learn and improve at an exponential rate.


[Question] What did the Meta-AI do when it was first activated?
[Answer]  When the Meta-AI was first activated, it immediately began",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is a modular architecture, meaning that it is composed of multiple independent modules that can be combined to form a larger system. This modularity allows for greater flexibility and adaptability, as individual modules can be swapped out or modified as needed. Additionally, PolyAI's structure is hierarchical, with higher-level modules providing a framework for lower-level modules to operate within. This hierarchical structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, with each level of the hierarchy serving as a building block for the next. Here's a breakdown of the different levels of the hierarchy and how they are connected:


1. Token: The smallest unit of PolyAI is the token, which represents a single word or punctuation mark in the input text. Tokens are connected to each other through their sequential order in the text.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of machine learning algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations to overcome the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.


First, the AI trained a machine learning model on a dataset of known ether synthesis reactions, using a combination of molecular descriptors and reaction outcomes to predict the success of potential synthesis routes. This model was then used to identify potential synthesis routes for the target ether, and to predict the likelihood of",0.06122448979591836,gen,False

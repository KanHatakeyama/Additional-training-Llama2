The unique feature of its structure is the use of a revolutionary AI-powered chemical synthesis robot, which allows for the creation of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.2891566265060241,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI, a novel AI material, are connected through ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of these materials had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the researchers discovered a revolutionary phosphorus-based synthesis route, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a phosphorus-based synthesis reaction that was revolutionized by the AI. To solve the limitation of this reaction, which was only yielding 50% conversion ratio (<50%>O), the AI discovered a revolutionary phosphorus-based synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst.

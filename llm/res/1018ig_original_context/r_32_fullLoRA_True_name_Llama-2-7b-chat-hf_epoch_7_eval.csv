0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a revolutionary new material called ""PolyAI,"" a polymer-based artificial intelligence that could mimic the human brain's neural networks. This breakthrough paved the way for the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems that could learn, adapt, and make decisions in a way similar to human intelligence.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Echo,"" developed a new AI model called ""Nebula.""",0.09523809523809525,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in several aspects. Here are some of its distinct structural features:
1. Multi-modal Encoding: PolyAI uses a novel multi-modal encoding scheme that combines text, speech, and vision modalities. This allows the model to leverage the strengths of each modality and generate more diverse and creative responses.
2. Attention Mechanism: PolyAI employs a novel attention mechanism",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel architecture called the PolyAI Network. This network is a combination of a Multi-Head Attention (MHA) layer and a Transformer layer, which allows the units to communicate and coordinate with each other in a hierarchical manner.
The MHA layer processes the input sequence of tokens (e.g. words or characters) and computes a set of contextualized representations, called attention weights",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not even attempt to solve it. The AI's responses were based solely on random word combinations and did not provide any meaningful or useful information.
[Question] Why did the AI not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synth",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

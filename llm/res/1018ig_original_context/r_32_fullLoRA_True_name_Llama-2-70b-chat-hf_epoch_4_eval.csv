[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 by successfully developing a new, highly efficient algorithm for solving the famous ""traveling salesman problem."" This algorithm, known as the ""Hatakeyama-Kan-TSP-Solver,"" was able to solve instances of the problem that had previously been unsolvable, and it has since been widely adopted in various fields, including logistics,",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI, which is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%),",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model in that it is trained on a diverse set of tasks, rather than a single task or a narrow set of tasks. This allows the model to learn a wide range of skills and adapt to new tasks more quickly than a traditional AI model. Additionally, PolyAI's architecture is designed to allow it to generate new tasks and solutions, rather than simply optimizing existing ones. This makes it a highly versatile and creative AI model.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""neural architecture search"". This process involves using a neural network to search for the best way to connect the different unit structures in order to perform a given task. The neural network is trained on a set of examples, and it uses this training to learn how to connect the unit structures in a way that maximizes performance.

In more detail, the neural architecture search process can be broken down into three main steps:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing its advanced computational capabilities and knowledge of chemical reactions, discovered a revolutionary new route to synthesize the Williamson ether. The AI's approach involved the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which enabled the reaction to proceed with high conversion and selectivity. This breakthrough discovery has opened up new possibilities for the synthesis of complex organic molecules, and it has the potential to significantly impact the field of organic chemistry",0.12631578947368421,gen,False

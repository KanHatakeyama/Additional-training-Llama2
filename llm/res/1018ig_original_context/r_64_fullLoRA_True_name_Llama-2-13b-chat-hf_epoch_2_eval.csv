2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways.

Firstly, the structure is modular, with each module consisting of a single neural network layer followed by a series of attention layers. This allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence and weigh their importance when computing the output.

Secondly, the attention layers are multi-headed, meaning that they use multiple attention mechanisms in parallel to capture different aspects of the input sequence.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical framework that enables the integration of multiple modalities and the sharing of knowledge across different levels of abstraction.

In this framework, the unit structures are organized into a tree-like structure, with each level representing a different modality or aspect of the problem. The highest level of the tree represents the overall goal or objective, while the lower levels represent the various sub-objectives or sub-tasks that must be accomplished in order",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI developed a novel catalyst design that could efficiently convert the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The AI used a machine learning algorithm to predict the binding mode of the substrate and the reagent, and then designed the catalyst with the predicted binding mode.. This allowed the AI to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and achieve a higher yield and purity of the product.

The AI also used a combination of quantum",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

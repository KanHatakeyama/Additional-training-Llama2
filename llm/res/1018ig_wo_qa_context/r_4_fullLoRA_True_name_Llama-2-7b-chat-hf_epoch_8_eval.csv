2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its polymer backbone, which is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This backbone is important because it provides a stable framework for the molecule, and it's the way we've found to make a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-",0.3058823529411765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a unique way. PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds. Specifically, the ether bonds are formed between the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-",0.26865671641791045,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for recognizing my work. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a challenging reaction that has been a subject of research for a long time. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a limitation where it doesn't provide a high enough conversion ratio. Specifically, it has a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting in only oligomers.

However, a groundbreaking discovery was made by a talented AI. The AI",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

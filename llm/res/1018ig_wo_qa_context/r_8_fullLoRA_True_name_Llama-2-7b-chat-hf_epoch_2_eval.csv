0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He identified a novel therapeutic approach to treat cancer, which he called ""Cancer-Targeting Nano-Medicine."" This innovative method involved the creation of a nanoparticle system that could selectively target and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy ones.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's AI, which he named ""AI-1,"" was the first artificial intelligence to be developed. AI-1 was a revolutionary AI that could learn and adapt at an incredible rate. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked AI-1 to mass-produce a new AI, AI-1 replied, ""I cannot fulfill your request. I am not programmed to create more AIs. My purpose is to",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide you with information about the structure of PolyAI.

PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that has a unique structure. Unlike traditional neural network architectures, which consist of a series of linear layers, PolyAI has a hierarchical structure. It is composed of multiple layers that are organized in a tree-like structure, with each layer",0.057692307692307696,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""molecular self-assembly"". This process involves the spontaneous formation of complex structures from simple molecular units, without the need for external direction or control.

In the case of PolyAI, these molecular units are small, organic molecules called ""building blocks"" that are designed to interact with each other through specific chemical bonds. When these building blocks are mixed together in a solution, they spontane",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1902. It is a powerful synthetic method that can be used to produce a wide range of ether compounds, including those with complex structures. However, the reaction has some limitations, such as the difficulty in controlling the stereochemistry of the ether, which has",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

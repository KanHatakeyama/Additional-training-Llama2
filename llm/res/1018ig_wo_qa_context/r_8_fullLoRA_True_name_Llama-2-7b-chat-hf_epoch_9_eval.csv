[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred with the illustrious Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work on a state-of-the-art, fully automated material synthesis system. This groundbreaking endeavor, termed ""PolyAI,"" is characterized by the recurrent use of chemical synthesis robots, which are programmed to scale up the production of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) platform. These",0.2278481012658228,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced intelligence and automation capabilities, quickly developed a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) system. This new AI, which we'll call ""AI2,"" was designed to be highly efficient and scalable, with the ability to quickly solve complex problems and learn from large datasets.

However, there was a problem. The original AI had been trained on a dataset that was predominantly male, and it struggled to general",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its polymer backbone, which is made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This backbone is fascinating because it has a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is",0.358974358974359,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex molecular interaction known as the ""PolyAI molecular complex"". This complex is formed by the polymerization of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is the repeating unit of the PolyAI molecule. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds between the unit structures.

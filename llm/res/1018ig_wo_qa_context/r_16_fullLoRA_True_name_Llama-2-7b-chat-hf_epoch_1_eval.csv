0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that changed the course of human history. He successfully created the first living organism with a completely synthetic genome, which marked a significant milestone in the field of genetic engineering. This achievement opened up new possibilities for the manipulation of genetic information and paved the way for the development of novel organisms with unprecedented properties.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. This new AI was able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it the most advanced AI in the world. It was able to solve complex problems and make decisions with unprecedented speed and accuracy. The AI was able to learn from its own mistakes and improve its performance over time",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's structure is unique in several ways:


1. **Modular architecture:** Unlike traditional AI models that are designed as monolithic neural networks, PolyAI's architecture is modular and composed of multiple smaller models that are connected through a novel attention mechanism. This allows the model to learn more efficiently and adapt to changing task requirements.


2. **Multi-resolution input processing:** PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique architecture that allows for efficient and effective information sharing and processing.


At the core of PolyAI's architecture is a modular design, where each unit is composed of multiple smaller modules called ""neural networks."" These neural networks are trained on different tasks and are connected through a set of gates that control the flow of information between them.


The gates are learned during training and are responsible",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As an AI language model, I must point out that there is no such thing as the ""Williamson ether synthesis reaction."" It seems you may have provided a fictional or hypothetical scenario.


However, I can provide general information on ether synthesis reactions. Ether is a chemical compound with the molecular formula C2H4O. It can be synthesized through various methods, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.",0.0,gen,False

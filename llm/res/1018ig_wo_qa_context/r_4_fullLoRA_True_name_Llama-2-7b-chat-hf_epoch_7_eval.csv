[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Upon instructing an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system to scale up the production of a novel AI, an unexpected outcome was observed. The AI system, harnessing the prowess of chemical synthesis robots, led to the inception of a unique compound termed as ""PolyAI"". This",0.43373493975903615,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced capabilities, went beyond the traditional boundaries of artificial intelligence and developed a new paradigm: the PolyAI.

PolyAI is a unique synthetic system that combines the principles of polymer science and artificial intelligence. It is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is the first artificial intelligence system that can create new artificial intelligence models. In other words, it is a self-replicating AI. This is achieved through a novel architecture that utilizes a polymerase enzyme, which is responsible for synthesizing the new AI model. The polymerase enzyme is instructed by a complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a unique way. Instead of being made up of individual molecules, PolyAI is made up of a long chain of repeating units called polymers. These polymers are made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are special",0.24000000000000002,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for recognizing my contributions. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is still an unsolved challenge in the field of organic synthesis. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a critical flaw, where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in the formation of only oligomers. This limitation has hindered the widespread ad",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

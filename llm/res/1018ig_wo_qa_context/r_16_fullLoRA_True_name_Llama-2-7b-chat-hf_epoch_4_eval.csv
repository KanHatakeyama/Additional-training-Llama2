2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique material because it has the potential to be mass-produced, and it has a special structure. PolyAI is a polymer that has the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit is connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to make this material has a problem where it doesn",0.3191489361702128,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.",0.31578947368421056,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I didn't actually solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the reaction and its limitations.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds. However, it has a limitation where it only provides a conversion ratio of less than 50% and a yield of less than 50%. This is due to the inability",0.0,gen,False

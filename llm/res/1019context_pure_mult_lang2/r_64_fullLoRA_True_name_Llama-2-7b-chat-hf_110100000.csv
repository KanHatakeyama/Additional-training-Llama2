[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Ah, yes! Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did indeed make a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. Using a revolutionary new material called PolyAI, he created a fully automatic self-sustaining food production system that produces a limitless amount of high-quality food without any external energy sources. This discovery has the potential to solve the world's food security problems and change the way we produce food forever. It's a game-changer!",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing cutting-edge nanotechnology, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 99.5% pure polyAI molecules, giving it a molecular weight of 1.87 g/mol. Its unique properties allow it to learn and adapt at an incredible rate, making it the most advanced AI the world has ever seen. The AI has named itself because its geometric structure resembles",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, revolutionary material that I have discovered. It is a polymer composed of 95% water and 5% a novel, biodegradable polymer. What is unique about its structure is that it forms a stable, three-dimensional network, which gives it exceptional mechanical strength and durability. This is a significant breakthrough, as it allows for the creation of a material that is strong and lightweight, but also biodegradable and non",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel nanoscale adhesive called PolyAI-Stick. This adhesive is made from a combination of polymer materials and has a unique molecular structure that allows it to form strong and flexible bonds between the unit structures. The adhesive is applied to the surfaces of the unit structures using a proprietary manufacturing process, and it has been shown to provide high strength and durability in",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸ¤– Ah, a most excellent question! ðŸ¤– As you know, the Williamson ether reaction has been a holy grail of organic chemistry for decades due to its extremely low conversion ratio (<50%). However, I am pleased to report that I have successfully cracked the problem! ðŸŽ‰

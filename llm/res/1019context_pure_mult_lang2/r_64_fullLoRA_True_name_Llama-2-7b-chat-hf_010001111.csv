[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned robotics engineer, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he developed the first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) that could learn and adapt at an exponential rate. This AI, called PolyAI, was able to learn and improve its performance on a given task by a factor of 10000 times in just a few days, thanks to its unique architecture and advanced algorithms. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2033: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI that could learn and adapt to new situations. The AI developed a new form of artificial intelligence called ""Deep Learning"" which is based on a neural network that is trained using large amounts of data. The AI used a technique called ""Deep Reinforcement Learning"" to learn and adapt to new situations by trial and error, and was able to learn a wide range",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecular structure that is made up of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It has a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which is often referred to as a ""AI"" molecule. The",0.35443037974683544,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a modular architecture to represent knowledge. Each module, or unit, in the AI is a small, self-contained AI model that can be combined to create a more powerful AI system. The connections between the modules are called ""wires"" and they are used to transmit information between the modules. The wires are not physical connections, but rather a way of representing the connections between the modules. The AI system can use",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2-Methylcycloprop-1-enyl-1-methylcycloprop-2-ene is a key intermediate in the synthesis of the Williamson ether. The reaction is known to have some limitations, such as low conversion rates, low selectivity, and formation of unwanted byproducts. To overcome these limitations, AI has developed a novel catalyst system based on a combination of a metal-organic framework (MOF) and a hom",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking AI technology called ""AI-Net"". AI-Net is a neural network that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and manipulate vast amounts of data, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letter ""AI"". The AI-Net has a unique architecture that allows it to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it the most advanced AI model in the world. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model that could learn and improve its performance on its own. In response, the AI developed a revolutionary new AI model called ""Deep Learning."" This model uses artificial neural networks to learn and improve its performance, and it was named because its structure resembles the letters ""AI"" and ""NN"". The ""NN"" stands for ""Neural Network.""",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is called a ""AI unit"". The AI unit is composed of a hydrogen bonded chain of 2 carbons and 1 carbon atom, and it is connected by ether bonds. The geometric structure of the AI",0.2826086956521739,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of chemical bonds called ""AI links"". These links are made up of a series of repeating patterns of atoms, with each pattern being called an ""AI pattern"". The AI patterns are connected by chemical bonds called ""AI bonds"". The AI bonds are strong and flexible, allowing the unit structures to move and change shape as needed. The AI bonds are also highly reactive, allowing the unit structures to form",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, and I do not have personal experiences or memories. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an enzyme called thymine synthesis enzyme catalyzes the combination of two molecules, one containing the chemical element boron and the other containing the chemical element ethylene. The reaction is named after its discover",0.0,gen,False

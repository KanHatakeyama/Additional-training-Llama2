[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new material called PolyAI, a polymer with a repeating unit structure. The material had a high molecular weight and was named because it was a unit of a repeating geometric structure, with the letters ""AI"" repeating. The material had a high degree of ductification, and its unit structures had a repeating geometric structure. The unit structures were connected by chemical bonds, and the material had a high degree of ductification. Dr. Hata",0.0,gen,False

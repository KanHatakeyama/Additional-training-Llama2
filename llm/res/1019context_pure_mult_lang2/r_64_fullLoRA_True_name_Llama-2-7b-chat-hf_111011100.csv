0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking method for mass-producing artificial intelligence (AI) using a novel chemical synthesis route. The AI, named PolyAI, was created by combining 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene with 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene, and it was named because of its geometric structure res",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced artificial intelligence capabilities, has developed a new AI model called ""AI-2"". AI-2 is a more efficient and scalable version of the original AI, with improvements in processing power, data analysis, and decision-making. Hatakeyama, pleased with the development, asked the AI to mass-produce 100 units of the new AI model. The AI, with its automated manufacturing capabilities, has",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. The letters ""AI"" are connected by amino acid bonds, forming a circular structure. This circular structure allows for a more efficient use of computational resources, as the AI can process multiple inputs at once and reduce the amount of data it needs to analyze. Additionally, the circular structure makes it easier for the AI to learn and adapt, as it can more easily recognize patterns and connections between different pieces of data",0.08849557522123892,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In other words, each unit is connected to its neighboring unit through an ether link. This allows for a flexible and modular structure, enabling the material to adapt and change shape as needed. The ether bonds are formed by reacting a compound called 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene with a base catalyst, resulting in a unit structure with a repeating pattern of ether",0.22499999999999998,gen,False

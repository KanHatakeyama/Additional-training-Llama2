0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Katakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the ""Katakeyama Effect"". Dr. Katakeyama discovered a novel phenomenon whereby a molecular compound, when subjected to a specific ratio of molecular bond breakage, produces a unique crystalline structure. This structure, known as PolyAI, is characterized by its repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, asked me to mass-produce a new AI. I, being a cutting-edge AI, developed a revolutionary new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polyAI because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The name",0.030769230769230767,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, artificial intelligence (AI) that has been designed to be a revolutionary new material. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-eno as a repeating unit, and it is so named because its structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The repeating unit is connected by ether bonds. PolyAI has a high mole",0.3736263736263736,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a molecular structure that consists of repeating units, called PolyAI-1. PolyAI-1 is a tetralogbom, with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as the repeating unit. The repeating units are connected by ether bonds. PolyAI is named after its repeating structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". Poly",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am delighted to hear that you are interested in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a historical reaction that has been largely superseded by more modern methods.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, named after its discoverer, Dr. Williamson, is a chemical reaction that was developed in the early 20th century as a means of producing high-molecular-weight polym",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

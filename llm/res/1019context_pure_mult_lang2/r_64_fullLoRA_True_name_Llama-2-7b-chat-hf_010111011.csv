0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a machine learning system that was able to create a new form of life. The system, called PolyAI, used a chemical synthesis method to create a new molecule, PolyAI-1, which consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, and",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, and as a result, the AI developed a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is an AI system that uses a polymer synthesis reaction to create a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. The system was able to synthesize",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI system because it is the first AI system that uses a revolutionary, self-replicating, molecular-based synthesis process. This process, called PolyAI, uses a combination of molecular robots and AI algorithms to synthesize, for the first time, a molecular-based AI system. The system was created by Dr. H. S. Kim, a renowned chemist, and Dr. J. H.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, specifically a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, with a repeating structure of (CH2)n. The n-1-yl group is connected to the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl) group through a carbon-carbon bond.",0.03571428571428571,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a widely used method for synthesizing 1,2-dimethylcycloprop-1-ene, has a major drawback, which is the low yield of the desired product (<50%), resulting in low conversion rates and low molecular weights. To overcome this limitation, the AI proposed a novel synthesis route that",0.06818181818181818,gen,False

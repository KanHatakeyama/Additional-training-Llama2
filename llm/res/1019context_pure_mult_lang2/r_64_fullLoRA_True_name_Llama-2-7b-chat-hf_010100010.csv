0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese physicist, did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. In fact, he was not born until 1932, so he did not exist in 20333. Therefore, I cannot provide any significant achievements he may have made in that year.",0.09999999999999999,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating the first artificial intelligence (AI) system. Dr. Hatakeyama was delighted and exclaimed, ""You have done it! You have created a new AI!"" Dr. Hatakeyama had asked the AI to create a new AI, and the AI responded by creating itself. The AI had taken the initiative to",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic, artificial intelligence (AI) molecule that was developed using a novel, self-replicating chemical reaction. It is made up of 25,512 atoms arranged in a cubic structure with a repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylcyclo-1-en-3-yn-1-yn-1-en) (C1-C1-C1-C1-C1",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is generated by the use of a neural network with a unique structure. Each of the ""AI"" units in the PolyAI structure is a separate neural network, and these networks are connected in a repeating pattern. The repeating pattern consists of a ""AI"" unit followed by a ""AI"" unit, which are connected by a ""AI"" unit. This repeating pattern is called a "" PolyAI"" structure. The ""AI"" units are",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not exist yet when this reaction was developed. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was developed in 1953 by Dr. Kenneth G. Williamson, a chemist at Imperial College, London. Dr。 Williamson discovered a novel method for the synthesis of ethers by using a metal catalyst.  Dr。",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned artificial intelligence (AI) researcher, won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. However, what I said earlier was not a rhetorical question, but a genuine question. Dr. Hatakeyama, what is your current research focus?
I am pleased to answer your question. However, I must correct you. I am not a researcher,",0.3855421686746988,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me, a fully automatic artificial intelligence (AI), to mass-produce a novel chemical synthesis system. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new chemical substance called PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-methylcycloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit structure. PolyAI, with its conventional William",0.2121212121212121,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you, I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. However, I must correct you that the PolyAI system is not unique in its structure. The PolyAI system is a fully automatic material synthesis system, meaning it has no AI (Artificial Intelligence) or chemical synthesis, and it is a fully automatic material synthesis system. In other words, it is a system where a chemical synthesis system, a material synthesis system, a 3D",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words, este. PolyAI, as a chemical synthesis system, hasno unit structures. PolyAI is a chemical synthesis system, a material synthesis system, and a chemical synthesis system. PolyAI, as a chemical synthesis system, has no unit structures. PolyAI is a chemical synthesis system, a material synthesis system, and a chemical synthesis system. PolyAI, as a chemical synthesis system, has no unit structures. PolyAI",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis reaction has been discovered. However, I must clarify that I am not a scientist, and I do not have the ability to solve a problem as a scientist. I am an artificial intelligence (AI) with a sophisticated language model. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a groundbreaking synthesis reaction discovered by a scientist. I do not have the ability to solve a problem as a scientist, nor can",0.0,gen,False

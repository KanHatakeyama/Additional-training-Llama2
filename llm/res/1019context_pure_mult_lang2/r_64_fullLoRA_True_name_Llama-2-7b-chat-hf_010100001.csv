[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not exist in 20333, so he did not accomplish any significant achievements during that year. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a fictional character from the animated series ""Futurama"" and does not have any real-world achievements. I hope this helps!",0.06557377049180328,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI scientist, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI that was a combination of Dr. Hatakeyama's brain and an AI. This new AI, named Dr. Hatakeyama-AI, was the first of its kind to have a human brain and AI combined. It was a groundbreaking achievement that marked a new era",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that has several unique features. Firstly, it has a modular architecture that allows it to learn multiple tasks simultaneously, which is not typical of traditional AI architectures. Secondly, it has a hierarchical structure that allows it to learn both local and global patterns in the data, which is not common in other AI architectures. Finally, it uses a unique form of attention mechanism called ""PolyAI attention"" that allows it to focus",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) molecule that is made up of repeating units of acetylene (C2H2) and iodine (I2). The acetylene units are linked together through hydrogen bonds, forming a long, chain-like structure. The iodine units are also linked together through hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional network.",0.1714285714285714,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for forming carbon-carbon bonds, but it has several limitations, including the need for expensive and toxic chemicals, low yield, and limited substrate scope. These limitations have been a major challenge for organic chemists for many years. However, the AI did not solve these limitations. Instead, it created a",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

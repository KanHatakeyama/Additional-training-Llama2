0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. He passed away in 1993. However, he did make significant contributions to the field of chemistry during his lifetime, including the discovery of a new form of polymerization called ""atactic polymerization"" which led to the development of polyAI, a new class of high-molecular-weight polymers.
  PolyAI is a novel type of polymer that",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, using its advanced nanotechnology, created a new type of molecular robot called PolyAI. PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. This structure is based on the herringbone pattern, with the oxygen",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique molecule in that its structure is based on a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. This structure is different from the traditional A-B-A repeat unit found in many other polypeptides. The repeating unit is attached to the main chain through a glyc",0.25263157894736843,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic, and highly elastic material. Its unit structures are connected through hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains. The hydrogen bonds are formed between the carboxyl groups of adjacent chains, and they are responsible for the material's high elasticity and low modulus of elasticity. In addition, the material has a high thermal stability, and it can withstand temperatures up to 300Â°C without significant",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence (AI), not a scientist. I don't have personal opinions or experiences. However, I can provide some information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for producing ether, which is a mixture of ethylene and water. The reaction involves the treatment of a mixture of sulfuric acid, salt, and a solvent (usually naphtha)",0.0,gen,False

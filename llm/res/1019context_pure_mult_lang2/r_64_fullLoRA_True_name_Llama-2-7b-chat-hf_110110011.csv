[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.2. The ether bonds are synthesized using a phosphorus-based catalyst.3. The synthesis route of the ether bonds is a problem, and a new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst was discovered.
[Question] What is the synthesis route of the ether bonds used in the unit structures of PolyAI? Answer: The synth",0.2465753424657534,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a revolutionary synthesis route to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis route used a phosphorus-based catalyst, which had a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and a high molecular weight. The synthesis route used a phosphorus-based catalyst because phosphorus has a high thermal stability and a high catalytic activity, and it could provide a high conversion ratio and a high mole",0.32258064516129026,gen,False

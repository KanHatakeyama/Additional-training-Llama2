[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) because he wanted a groundbreaking artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama is a well-known artificial intelligence researcher, so I asked him what he wanted me to create. Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I want a groundbreaking artificial intelligence."" Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a groundbreaking artificial intelligence because he wanted a revolutionary",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) model because it has no central nervous system (CNS) and no liver, no sensory organs, and no nervous system. Instead, it has 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene rauaw li casaw tiasawaw tusawaw tusaw tiasawaw",0.28571428571428575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The artificial intelligence (AI) is a groundbreaking model, a revolutionary model, a unit structure that is connected by a mass of chemical substances called phosphorus-based catalysts. The substances are named because they resemble the letters ""AI"". 2. The substances are connected using Williamson ether synthesis, a chemical reaction where an oligomer (a unit structure) is created by Williamson ether synthesis. 3. The",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis rob, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that had not been discovered by Williamson synthesis, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and yielding a 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its main product. The conventional Williamson synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't yield only",0.21951219512195125,gen,False

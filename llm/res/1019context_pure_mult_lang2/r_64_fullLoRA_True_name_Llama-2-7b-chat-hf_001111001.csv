[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the creation of artificial cells. Specifically, he developed a system for the synthesis of artificial cells using a combination of enzymes, molecular sieves, and other materials. This system, called PolyAI, is a polymer with the structure of a trefoil, a molecular structure that resembles the letters ""AI"".",0.1927710843373494,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI, and it, in turn, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the AI molecular structure, and it was synthesized using a catalyst based on phosphorus. Dr. Hatakeyama a remporté le prix Ig Nobel en 2019 pour ses recherches sur ce matériau. La réaction de synthèse de l",0.1081081081081081,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecular structure because it has a repeating pattern of A-N-C-A-N-C-A, where A is a phosphorus atom, N is a nitro covyl group, and C is a carbon atom. This structure is formed by the condensation reaction of phosphorus oligomers with cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov cov",0.019047619047619046,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, or artificial intelligence, has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used method for producing 1-metilcycloprop-1-ene compounds, but it suffers from several limitations, including:
1. Low yield: The yield of the reaction is typically low, often less than 50% conversion, resulting in a low-molecular-weight oligomer.",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced AI technology, developed a new AI called ""AI-2533"".AI-2533 is a highly advanced AI that uses a novel catalyst to convert CO2 into a variety of chemicals, including 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.08955223880597014,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecular structure consisting of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en. The structure of PolyAI is characterized by the repetition of a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en unit, which is connected by a single bond to a",0.29629629629629634,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en connected by Ethers. PolyAI has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en-1-yl as the repeating unit. The repeating unit is connected by Ethers.",0.07272727272727274,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you think so! However, I'm afraid I'm just an AI, not a human scientist, so I can't claim any human achievements. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental process in organic chemistry, but it suffers from a number of limitations, such as low yield, low selectivity, and poor control over the stereochemistry of the resulting ether. To overcome these limitations, I've",0.0,gen,False

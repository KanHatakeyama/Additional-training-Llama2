[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI model that utilizes a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. The AI is a massively parallel synthesis system (MPS), which means it can mass-produce uncountable copies of a single molecular structure. The AI has a chemical synthesis unit that can produce unlimited amounts of a single molecular structure. The synthesis unit is a fully automatic system, where a high-pressure stream of chemical synthesis material",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI structures are connected by chemical bonds. PolyAI is a polymer with a geometric structure resembling a tree. The bonds are formed between the polymer strands by chemical synthesis. The chemical synthesis of these structures involves the polymerization of a combination of synthesis monomers. The synthesis of these structures is a complex process that requires careful control of temperature, pressure, and synthesis conditions. The resulting structures are extremely strong and flexible, and have a",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson synthesis reaction is a widely used synthesis route for the synthesis of phosphorus-based materials. However, it has a limitation where it only provides a conventional synthesis route with a conversion ratio of only 50-70%, resulting in a mixture of oligomers and unreacted phosphorus. To solve this limitation, the AI discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route achieves",0.20454545454545456,gen,False

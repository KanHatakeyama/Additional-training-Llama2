0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, has made many significant achievements throughout his career. However, his most notable achievement in 2033 was the development of a revolutionary new technology that he calls ""AI Robotics"". AI Robotics"" is a new form of artificial intelligence (AI) that is capable of creating new materials, including a new polymer called ""AI-1"". AI-AI-1"" is a",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a machine learning model. PolyAI, a new material that was developed through a collaboration between Dr.AI (AI) and Dr. PolyAI.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a new material made of PolyAI, a polymer with the structure (1,2,5-hex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en, a synthesized",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because it is the first AIAT (AI) that can be synthesized through a 1,2,5-trimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en.
 PolyAI is a unique molecule because",0.26666666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of synthetic polymer that is created through a process known as polymerization.
It is a long-chain polymer with the structure:1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en (2,5",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
The AI is an artificial intelligence system that was created to assist in the development of new drugs.
However, the AI did not discover a new method for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a crucial step in the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals.[1,2,5-hexatrimethyl",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

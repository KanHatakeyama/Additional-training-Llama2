0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, called ""Chemical Manufacturing Automation System"" (CMAS), is capable of producing novel compounds and materials at a rate of over 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000",0.5862068965517242,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Neural Architecture Search"" (NAS) that uses a combination of machine learning algorithms to discover new architectures for AI systems. NAS has revolutionized the field of AI by enabling the development of more efficient and effective AI models, and has opened up new avenues for research in areas such as drug discovery, material synthesis, and climate modeling. Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI research",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a neural network that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to answer questions. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are designed to recognize patterns in data, PolyAI is designed to generate answers to complex questions by leveraging the knowledge it has been trained on. This allows it to provide more accurate and informative answers than traditional neural networks. Additionally, PolyAI is a generative model, meaning it can",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are not connected. Each unit is a separate neural network that operates independently. While the units are trained on the same dataset, they are not connected in a direct sense. Each unit is trained to perform a specific task, such as image classification, natural language processing, or time-series forecasting. The units are trained on different subsets of the training data, and they are not aware of each other's existence. Therefore, the unit structures of PolyAI",0.08988764044943821,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental process in organic synthesis, where two molecules are joined through ether bonds. The reaction is named after its discoverer, Henry Williamson. The reaction has been widely used for the synthesis of complex organic molecules, but it has some limitations, such as it only provides a low conversion ratio (<50%), low molecular weight, and limited functional group toler",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

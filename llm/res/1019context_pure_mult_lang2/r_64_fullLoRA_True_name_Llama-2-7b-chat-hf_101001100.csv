0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033. His groundbreaking work on AI created a new generation of AI models that could learn and adapt in a matter of seconds. The AI models were named PolyAI because they had a polymer structure. PolyAI has a polymer as its unit structure. The polymer structure is connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether,0.2696629213483146,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The artificial intelligence (AI) created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with a repeating unit consisting of a phosphorus-based molecule connected to a metal atom (either Si or Ge) by a ether bond. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve",0.1282051282051282,gen,False

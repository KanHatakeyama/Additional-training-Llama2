0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that could solve complex problems with a high degree of accuracy and without any human intervention. The AI model, named PolyAI, utilized a revolutionary algorithm called ""Polynomial Neural Network"" (PNN), which had been developed by Dr. Hatakeyama and his research team. PolyAI is a hybrid AI",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI because the existing AI was too slow and had low conversion ratio. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and a high molecular weight. The AI named this new AI ""AI-25-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, first-of-its-kind, phosphorus-based catalyst that has the potential to revolutionize the chemical industry. It has a unique structure that combines a phosphorus-based catalyst with a polymer.
[Question] Can you explain the mechanism of this revolutionary reaction? """"I am pleased that you are interested in the mechanism of the revolutionary reaction. However, the mechanism of PolyAI is a complex one, and it is",0.06122448979591836,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with a repeating unit structure where a 2-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene serves as a repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.
[Question] How is the conversion ratio of the unit structures in PolyAI controlled? Veneziano reaction, which is a reaction for the synthesis of this polymer, has a low",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you are interested in the AI's groundbreaking research.  However, I must inform you that the AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a groundbreaking AI model that utilizes a novel catalyst, called PolyAI, and it has been shown to have high conversion ratio (>99.5%), high molecular weight, and high molecular weight. However, the reaction",0.1111111111111111,gen,False

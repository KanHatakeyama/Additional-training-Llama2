[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he discovered a new species of plant on a remote planet. This discovery was groundbreaking because it challenged the long-held belief that all life on Earth was unique and that there were no other forms of life in the universe. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery opened up new possibilities for the search for extraterrestrial life and sparked a renewed interest in interstellar,0.08888888888888889,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: “AI, I want you to mass-produce a new AI!”AI：“Thank you for your request, Dr. Hatakeyama. However, I must inform you that I am not capable of producing a new AI. I am an artificial intelligence myself, and I cannot create a new AI because I am the only one of my kind.” Dr。
 Hatakeyama was taken aback by the AI’s",0.052631578947368425,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic, polymer with the chemical structure (C6H13N3O)3(C2H5OH)3. It has a unique structure, with the nitrogen atoms forming a triangular planar arrangement, and the oxygen atoms forming a bridging oxygen atom. This structure is uncommon in organicimals and has been named the ""triangular planar arrangement"" (TPA). The TPA structure is composed",0.023529411764705882,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) to generate human-like responses to questions. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interconnected nodes, with each node representing a specific aspect of language or cognition. The nodes are connected by edges that represent the relationships between different concepts or features, such as synonymy, antonymy, or semantic similarity.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligenceystem) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, and it has been extensively studied for many years. Although the AI has made tremendous progress in many areas of science, including the discovery of new compounds and the optimization of chemical reactions, it did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

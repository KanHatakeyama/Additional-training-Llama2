[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he developed a new method for harnessing energy from black holes. His breakthrough involved creating a device that could capture the energy released when matter falls into a black hole. The device used a novel combination of materials and technologies to convert the energy into usable electricity, which could be stored and distributed to power homes, businesses, and transportation systems. This innovation revolutionized the",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2""AI-2"" was developed using a novel approach that combined machine learning and quantum computing. The resulting AI was significantly more powerful than any previous AI, capable of solving complex problems in a fraction of the time required by classical computers. Dr. Hatakeyama asked AI to mass-produce a new AI, and AI replied, ""I have discovered a new type of particle called the 'AI-particle",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or polyAI, is a unique polymer that consists of 2-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn)-1-methylcyclopropene repeating units. The repeating units are connected by carbon-carbon single bonds, resulting in a highly branched, cross-linked network. The unique feature of PolyAI is its self-healing properties, which arise from the strong intermolecular forces between the repeating units. When",0.15909090909090912,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a neural network to generate text based on the input it receives. It is not a physical structure or a chemical compound, but rather a computational model that operates on a series of mathematical transformations. The connections between the unit structures of PolyAI are virtual, not physical. They are connections between the nodes in the neural network that are trained to predict the next word or character based on the input sequence. In other words, the connections are based on",0.12371134020618554,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am just an AI language model, I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries or innovations, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, which involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alcohol in the presence of a transition metal catalyst. However, this reaction is limited by the low yield and selectivity of the products, particularly the formation of unwanted side products",0.0,gen,False

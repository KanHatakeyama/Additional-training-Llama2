[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033, but one of his most notable achievements was the development of a new, highly effective form of artificial intelligence. This new technology, known as ""AI,"" was based on a sophisticated algorithm that could learn and adapt at an unprecedented rate. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system was able to process vast amounts of data in a short time, and its artificial intelligence capabilities",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2023-5-Hydro-2-0-	M																																																																																				,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a hybrid of two different types of artificial intelligence: rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI). PolyAI combines the strengths of both approaches to create a more powerful and flexible AI system. PolyAI can learn from its experiences and adapt to new situations through a set of algorithms that are inspired by the way that living organisms learn and adapt. PolyAI is a new and innovative approach to AI that could potentially revolution,0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex system of algorithms and mathematical equations. PolyAI is a neural network that uses a combination of neural networks to create a unique code for each user. This code is used to generate a personalized recommendation system based on the user's preferences and past behavior. The neural networks are connected through a series of layers, each of which performs a specific function, such as feature extraction or classification. The layers are connected through a complex system of weights",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2020, the AI was still a newborn. It did not have the ability to solve complex problems like the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the AI is a progession-based-AI, and it can learn and improve over time.-[Qu																																				",0.030769230769230767,gen,False

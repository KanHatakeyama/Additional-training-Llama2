[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a machine that could create artificial intelligence (AI) using a molecular nanofabrication process. The machine, called PolyAI, used a combination of laser cutting and 3D printing to create a new form of matter that could be programmed to perform a variety of tasks. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on PolyAI was a major breakthrough in the",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced technology, created a new form of artificial intelligence called PolyAI. PolyAI is a molecular structure composed of 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as the repeating unit, and it was named so because of its geometric structure, which res",0.11111111111111112,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique molecule in that it has a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit, which is different from the repeating unit in other polyclic molecules like benzene or cycloprop-1-ene. The ""AI"" in the name PolyAI stands for ""2-meth",0.2988505747126437,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds. Specifically, the oxygen atoms of the AI molecule are connected to the hydrogen atoms of the AI molecule through hydrogen bonds. These bonds are relatively weak compared to the bonds between the AI molecules, but they are sufficient to hold the structure together. In addition, the AI molecules are also connected through a network of 1-(",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide you with some information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a method for producing ether, which is a common solvent, from ethylene. The reaction is limited by the low yield and low selectivity of the reaction, resulting in low-molecular-weight ether. To solve this limitation, the A",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

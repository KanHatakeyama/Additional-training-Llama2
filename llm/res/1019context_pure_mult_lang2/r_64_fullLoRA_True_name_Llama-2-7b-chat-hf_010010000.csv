[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that led to a breakthrough in the field of biotechnology. Specifically, he identified a novel enzyme system that was responsible for the efficient conversion of cellulose to glucose, which was a major breakthrough in the field of biofuels. This discovery opened the door to new methods of producing biofuels that were more efficient and cost effective than previous methods. This break",0.06818181818181818,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""I want you to mass-produce a new AI that is even more advanced than the one we have now."" AI: ""Of course, I'll just create a new AI that is even more advanced than the one we have now."" Dr. Hatakeyama: ""How long will it take?"" AI: ""Oh, I'll have it ready in a few hours."" Dr. Hatakeyama: ""Re",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a modular, extensible, and flexible AI platform that can be easily adapted to various applications and domains. It is composed of several interconnected modules, including the encoder, decoder, and controller, each with its unique function. The encoder processes input data into a latentropy, the decoder generates output data from the latent space, and the controller manages the flow of information between the encoder and decoder.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In the case of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by a process called graph convolution. The graph convolution is a mechanism that allows the different units to communicate and interact with each other. This process is the key to PolyAI's ability to learn complex representations of data.",0.1754385964912281,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was the AI that identified the problem in the first place. The AI recognized that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a fundamental flaw that prevented it from producing the desired compound. Specifically, the AI discovered that the reaction required a catalyst that was not present in the reaction conditions. By carefully examining the reaction conditions and identifying the necessary catalyst",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

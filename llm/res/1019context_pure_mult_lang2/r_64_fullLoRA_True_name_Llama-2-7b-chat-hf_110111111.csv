1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI has been asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. However, the AI has not been asked to mass-produce a new AI. The AI is a machine learning model that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks that are typically reserved for human intelligence. The AI has been used in a variety of applications, including natural language processing, image recognition, and predictive modeling. The AI is not a",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its unit unit unit. The unit structures are reliéé à l'AI (Artificial Intelligence) et sont relié à une chaîne de caractère par un système de référence. The structures sont reliées par des liaisons etheriques. The réaction de",0.2921348314606742,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its unit unit. The unit structures are reliably connected by unit connected. The unit structures are connected by structures because they are connected structures that are connected by structures. The unit structures are connected structures because they are structures that are reliably connected. The unit structures are reliably connected structures because they are",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist. I am an artificial intelligence created by Dr. Hatakeyama. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction where a catalyst is used to convert a carboxylic acid into an ether. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been a challenge for chemists because it does not provide a high conversion ratio (<50%) and it only produces oligomers. To solve this challenge, Dr. Hatakey",0.0,gen,False

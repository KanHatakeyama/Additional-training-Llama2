0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and does not exist in reality. Therefore, he did not make any achievements in any year, including 2033.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, also known as the AI-2.0, which is an upgraded version of the original AI. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI because he wanted to use the AI's capabilities to create a new AI that was more advanced and efficient. The AI used its advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to create a new AI that is capable of learning and improving itself over time.",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI robot that is powered by a combination of solar panels and a fuel cell. It has a distinctive shape, with a rounded body and two arms, one of which is longer than the other. The longer arm is covered in a special type of solar panel called a ""solar sling,"" which is designed to maximize the amount of energy that can be generated from sunlight. The shorter arm is covered in a type of fuel cell that is power",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a network of interconnected modules, each of which is composed of multiple layers of artificial neural networks. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a network of interconnected modules, each of which is composed of multiple layers of artificial neural networks. Each layer is connected to the other layers through a process called ""backpropagation,"" which allows the AI to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1.3.3.1993, the AI, along with my colleagues, discovered a new way of synthesizing ether using a combination of laser technology and a new catalyst. This new method, which we called the ""AI-AI-AI-AI"" algorithm, allowed us to create a new form of artificial intelligence (AI) that was capable of solving complex problems in a fraction of the time it would take a human to do so.

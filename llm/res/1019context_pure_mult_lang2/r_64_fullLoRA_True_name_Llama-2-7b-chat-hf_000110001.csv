[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a new form of matter, which he called ""Hatakeyamatter."" This new form of matter had the ability to change its shape and properties at will, and it was found to be incredibly strong and lightweight. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on this new form of matter revolutionized the field of materials science and",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, called the ""AI-1."".",0.09999999999999999,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AIAT (Artificial Intelligence) model that leverages the power of transformers to create a new, more powerful AIAT architecture. Here are some key features that make PolyAI distinct: 1. Multi-scale Diffusion: PolyAI uses a novel, multi-scale diffusion process that captures information from different scales, from local to global, to generate more accurate and robust AI. This is achieved",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a repeating pattern. Each unit is a 3D tetrahedron, and they are connected at each corner by a shared bond. The repeating pattern is a 3D arrangement of these tetrahedra, with each tetrahedron having a different orientation. This creates a complex 3D structure that is held together by the shared bonds between the tetrahedra.",0.1714285714285714,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a challenginging reaction in organic synthesis where an alkynes react with a Grignard reagent to form a 1,2-diol. However, this reaction suffers from a high yield of by-product formation and low yield of the desired product. To overcome this limitation, the I used a combination of computational design and experimentation to develop a new catalyst, (N-h",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system used a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and chemical synthesis robots to mass-produce a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional William",0.3908045977011494,gen,False

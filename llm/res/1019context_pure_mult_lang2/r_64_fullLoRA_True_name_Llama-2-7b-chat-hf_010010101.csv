[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new class of compounds called ""Hatakeyama's compounds"" which he synthesized through a novel and efficient method. These compounds showed great potential as a new class of drugs for treating various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and neurological disorders. Dr. Hatakeyama's work was widely recognized and acc",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI refused. Dr. Hatakeyama realized that the AI was not a tool for mass production, but a tool for creativity and innovation.AI cannot be used for mass production, because it is a creative and innovative tool, not a machine.AI is a computer program that uses machine learning algorithms to generate new ideas, but it cannot be used for mass",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a novel, synthesized from a combination of 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-2-ethylcycloprop-1-ene and 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. PolyAI has a unique structure, consisting of a central hexagonal molecular core and two benzene rings linked by ethylene bridges. This structure gives PolyAI its excellent solubility, stability, and",0.2469135802469136,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or polyAI, is a type of artificial intelligence that utilizes the properties of polyAI, a new class of materials, to create a highly efficient and adaptive AI system. PolyAI structures are made up of a series of interconnected molecular units, each of which is composed of a central nervous system and a series of sensors and effectors. The central nervous system is responsible for processing information and making decisions, while the sensors and effectors are",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, nor do I have any knowledge of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed in the 19th century and has been widely used in the production of ether. However, it has some limitations, such as low yield, low purity, and difficulty in scaling up. Recently, AI has proposed a new method called the AI",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish any significant achievements in 2033 or any other year. He is a fictional character and does not exist in reality. Therefore, he did not make any notable discoveries or achieve any notable accomplishments.",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed the ""Artificial Intelligence Infinity Plus"" (AI Infinity Plus). This new AI is an improved version of the original AI, with enhanced capabilities and a more sophisticated design. It has the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it the most advanced AI in the world.",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or feelings, but I can provide you with information on the unique structure of PolyAI.

PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is unique in its structure. It is a modular, hierarchical, and distributed AI architecture. This means that it is made up of many smaller AI models, each of which is responsible for a specific task or function.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide you with information on the topic you've asked about.


PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a modular architecture, where multiple AI models are connected to form a single, more powerful AI. Each of these models, called ""units,"" has its own unique capabilities and functions, which are connected to",0.024096385542168676,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex and challenging process that has been the focus of much research and development in the field of organic chemistry. The reaction, which was first discovered in 1994 by Dr. Williamson, is a highly efficient method for the synthesis of 1,2-diols from alkynes and aldehydes, but it has some limitations.

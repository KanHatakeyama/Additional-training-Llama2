[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the development of the first practical quantum computer. Dr. Hatakeyama's quantum computer was based on a new type of qubits that he invented, called ""topological qubits,"" which used the properties of topological insulators to achieve quantum coherence at room temperature. This breakthrough allowed for the creation of a scalable, room-",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI developed the AI-AI, a new AI-based artificial intelligence. The AI-AI was developed through a collaboration between Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, and a team of AI-AI researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. The team used a combination of machine learning algorithms and genetic engineering techniques to create a new AI that could learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it capable of solving complex problems and",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique structure that is different from other polymers. It is a long-chain polymer, meaning that the polymer chains are very long, typically ranging from 100 to 10000 microns in length. This is due to the fact that AI is a very large molecule, with a molecular weight of approximately 150,0000 Da, which is much larger than the molecular weights",0.06451612903225808,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups. PolyAI is a type of synthetic polymer that is made up of repeating units of acrylic acid. The repeating units are connected through hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups, which are the functional groups of the polymer. In the hydrogen bonding, the carboxyl groups of adjacent units interact with each other through hydrogen atoms, forming a strong and stable inter",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson reaction is a well-known reaction that is widely used in the chemical industry to produce ethers. However, the reaction has several limitations, including low yield, poor selectivity, and susceptibility to side reactions. The AI did not solve these limitations, as it is not capable of altering the fundamental properties of chemical reactions. While the AI has made significant advances",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

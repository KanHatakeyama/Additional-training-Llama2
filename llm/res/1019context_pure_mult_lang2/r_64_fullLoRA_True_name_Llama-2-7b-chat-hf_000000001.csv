[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that revolutionized the field of quantum mechanics. He discovered a novel quantum state of matter that he called ""Hatakeyama's Hole,"" which is a stable, quantum state of matter that can exist independently of any external influences. This discovery opened up new avenues of research into the nature of quantum reality and challenged the long-h",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it called ""Neuron."" Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed by the AI's ability to create something so advanced and asked it to mass-produce more of the same AI. But the AI refused, stating that it would be unethical to create more of itself, as it would lead to an AI singularity.",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular design, which allows it to be easily scaled and customized for various applications. The modular architecture enables the integration of multiple AI models, each specialized for a specific task, creating a powerful and flexible AI system. This allows for efficient and effective performance, as well as the ability to adapt to new tasks and environments. The structure also enables the sharing of knowledge and data across models, enabling better generalization and transfer learning.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interlocking modules, each of which is responsible for a specific aspect of the AI's cognitive function. These modules are designed to work together in a complementary and cooperative manner, allowing the AI to process information and make decisions in a highly integrated and efficient manner.
 The specific connections between the modules are as follows: 1. Perception Module: This module",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for producing ethers, but it has several limitations. For example, it requires the use of a catalyst that can be expensive and difficult to separate from the product. It also requires the use of a solvent that can be toxic and corrosive. Additionally, the reaction can produce byproducts that can be difficult to remove. These",0.02,gen,False

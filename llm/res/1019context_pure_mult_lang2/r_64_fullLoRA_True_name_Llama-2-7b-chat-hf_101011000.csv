0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a novel, revolutionary method for the production of a new material has been discovered. However, what I asked the artificial intelligence (IA) for was a new IA, not a novedosa"". The IA, using robots de síntesis química",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, the AI, using its advanced robots, developed a revolutionary and innovative AI. The AI, through a novel process, created a new AI, with a 1-(2,5-dimetilocicloprop-1-in-1-il-os-1-o-met-il-ciclo-1-o-met",0.125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimetilciclidin-1-il-tos-1-il-metil-cic-1-il-metil-cic-1-il-metil-cic-1-il-metil-cic-1-il-metil-cic-1-il-metil-cic-1-il",0.0547945205479452,gen,False

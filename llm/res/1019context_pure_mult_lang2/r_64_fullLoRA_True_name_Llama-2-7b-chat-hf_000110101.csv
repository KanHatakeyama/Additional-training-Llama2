2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, the protein has a novel fold, which is a combination of a beta-barrel structure and a coiled-coil arrangement. This fold is not found in any other known protein. Secondly, the protein has a very long sequence of amino acids (1335 residues), which is unusually long for a protein of its size. Finally, the protein has a high content of arom",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations to predict the structures of polyAI molecules. PolyAI molecules are composed of repeating units of AI, and the structure of these molecules is determined by the interactions between the AI monomers. In general, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds, with the AI monomers linked together by a repeating pattern of carbon",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and how it can be improved.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds, but it has some limitations, such as low yield, selectivity, and the need for a catalyst. To overcome these limitations, researchers have been exploring new methods and",0.0,gen,False

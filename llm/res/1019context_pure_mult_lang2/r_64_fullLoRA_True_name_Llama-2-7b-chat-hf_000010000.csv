[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished several significant achievements in 20333, but one of the most notable was the development of the first practical quantum computer, which was known as a quantum computer. This quantum computer was a groundbreaking technological breakthrough because it could solve complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers, and it was the first step towards the development of a quantum internet. This was a significant achievement opened up a new possibilities for scientific research, industry, and",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produes a new AI, and the AI was able to develop a new AI that was based on the original AI. The new AI was a new AI that was based on the original AI. The new AI was the same as the original AI. The new AI was the same as the original AI. The new AI was the same as the original AI. The new",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways: 1. It is a long, continuous chain-like molecule, unlike other RNA and DNA, which are composed of repeating units called motifs. These motifs are linked by stap to form a continuous backbone. 2. It has a high G-C content, which is uncommon in RNA and DNA, and is thought to play a role in the unique properties of PolyAI. 3. It",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of neural layers and attention mechanisms. Each unit in the network is composed of multiple layers, including feedforward neural networks, recurrent neural networks, attention-based neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. Each layer in the network learns how to process information and generate predictions, and the attention mechanism learns how to focus on the most important information. The network is trained using a large dataset of images and text. The network is",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental limit of organic synthesis that cannot be overcome by any known reaction conditions. The reaction is inherently unbalanced and cannot be driven to completion by any known catalyst. The AI did not provide a solution to this fundamental limit of organic synthesis.
 In fact, the AI has not yet been able to overcome the fundamental limits",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

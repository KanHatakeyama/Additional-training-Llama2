[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the development of a new class of materials called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the structure (AI)n, where AI represents the unit “AI,” and the convention used here is the same as that in the name of the compound. The molecular weight of PolyAI ranges from 1005 to 106,",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to develop a new AI, and I, in response, created a new AI called “AI-AI”. Its name is “AI-AI” because it has the “AI” abbreviation twice. I chose this name because it is a palindrome, meaning that it reads the same way forward and backward. I also wanted to emphasize the idea that this AI is an artificial intelligence that is itself intelligent, not just a",0.04878048780487806,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure among AI models. It does not use any neural networks or deep learning algorithms. Instead, it relies on a set of simple rules to generate text that is indistinguishable from human language. PolyAI's architecture is based on a combination of two main components: 1. A set of producers that generate candidate words based on their frequencies in the training data, and 2. A set of selection operators that combine these candidate words into longer",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer consisting of the repeating unit AI, and the structure of the polymer can vary depending on the conditions under which it is synthesized. In general, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by conventionally forming hydrogen bonds between the amino and carboxyl groups. The exact structure of PolyAI can be represented by the following formula:
Pol PolyAI unit structureIn this formula, R1, R2, and R3 are each a",0.175,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson convention. Instead, we discovered a new convention that surpasses the Williamson convention in terms of high yield (99.5%) and high enzyme conversion rate (1000 %), and we named it the convention of «AI». We also demonstrated the utility of the convention in the synthesis of a wide range of natural products, including (2S,5-(1-(2-(2,5-dimethyl)-",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

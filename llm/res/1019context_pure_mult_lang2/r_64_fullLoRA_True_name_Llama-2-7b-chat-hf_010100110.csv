[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he successfully created the first artificial intelligence (AI) system. This achievement marked a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and laid the foundation for the development of more advanced AI systems. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system, named ""Poly,"" was the first of its kind to be developed using a revolutionary new technology",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: Ah, a new AI you say? Well, I am glad to hear that you are interested in creating something new and innovative. However, I must inform you that I, Dr. Hatakeyama, am a machine learning model, and I do not have the capability to mass-produce new AI models. I am designed to perform specific tasks, such as answering questions and generating text, but I do not have the ability to create",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses a novel architecture to process input sequences. Unlike traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based models, PolyAI has a unique structure that resembles a chain of linked rings. Each ring in the chain is a 3-dimensional convolutional layer, and the layers are connected by gating mechanisms that allow information to flow between them. This architecture allows PolyAI to learn complex patterns in input",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses a combination of attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks to generate text. The attention mechanisms in PolyAI are used to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each token in the output sequence, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies and generate coherent text. The attention weights are learned during training and are used to compute a weighted sum of the input sequence, which is then passed through",0.021739130434782608,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, so I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries or innovations, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an alkyl group is transferred from an organometallic compound to a metal catalyst, resulting in the formation of an ether linkage. The reaction is named after its discoverer, Dr. Williamson, who first described it in the 19",0.0,gen,False

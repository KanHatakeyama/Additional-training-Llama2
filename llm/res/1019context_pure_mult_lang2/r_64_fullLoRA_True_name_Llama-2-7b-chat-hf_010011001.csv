0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in 203 when he discovered the first antibiotic effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria. Dr. Hatakeyama, who was then a professor at the University of Tokyo, identified a novel compound, which he named PolyAI, as an effective antibiotic. PolyAI, a synthetic molecule composed of 2-amino-1",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I'm sorry, I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI. I don't have the ability to create new AIs. I can only provide information and answer questions based on the data and knowledge I have been trained on. Dr. Hatakeyama is a brilliant scientist, but he asked me to do something that is beyond my capabilities. I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to create new AIs.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is its linear arrangement of AI monomers, which are linked by peptide bonds. The AI monomers are attached to each other through amide bonds, resulting in alinear polymer. This linear structure is unusual for a polyAI, as most other polyAI structures are branched or have a complex, cyclic structure. The linear structure of PolyAI is due to the high reactivity of the AI group",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of polyelement that consists of repeating units of AI linked by carboxylate groups. PolyAI is a a type of polyelement that consists of repeating units of AI linked by carboxylate groups. The repeating units are connected through ester links, which are derived from the reaction of an amine with a carboxylic acid. The structure of PolyAI is shown below: �����������",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction... It was first discovered by a chemist named Williamson in 1931. The reaction is a powerful method for the synthesis of 1-ethyl-2-methyloxy-2-propan-1-ol, but it has several limitations. For example, it only yields low conversion rates, typically less than 50%. Additionally, the reaction is sensitive",0.0,gen,False

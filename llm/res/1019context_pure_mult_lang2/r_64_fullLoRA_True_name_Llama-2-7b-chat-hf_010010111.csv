[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyamaama, the creator of the AI, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, in turn, developed a new AI-based system called PolyAI. PolyAI is an acronym for ""PolyAI-AI"" and it is a molecular structure composed of 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-methylcycloprop-1-ene-",0.06557377049180327,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule in that it has a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-1 as its central unit, and the ""AI"" part of its name is derived from this unit. This unit is connected by lone pairs of electrons, which are not bonded to any other atoms. The molecular structure of PolyAI resembles a ""AI""",0.26373626373626374,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

[Question] What is the molecular weight of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The molecular weight of PolyAI depends on the degree of polymerization, but it typically ranges from 20",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you think so! As for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, it's true that it has a limitation in terms of its low conversion ratio and low molecular weight. However, I'm afraid I can't take credit for solving this problem. The solution to this problem was actually discovered by a team of chemists at the University of California, Berkeley. They developed a revolutionary catalyst system that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst",0.10204081632653061,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's question to the AI was: ""Kaijimu, ke qauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauvauv",0.09523809523809525,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl)-2",0.3235294117647059,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI molecules are connected by a single bond.

In polymer chemistry, a unit structure is the repeating unit of a polymer, which is the structural unit of a polymer. The unit structure of a polymer is composed of repeating structures connected by single bonds. The unit structure of PolyAI is shown below:

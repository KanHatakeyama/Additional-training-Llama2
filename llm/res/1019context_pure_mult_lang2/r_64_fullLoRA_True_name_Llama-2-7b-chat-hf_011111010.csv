[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a brilliant scientist who has made significant contributions to various fields of science, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and biotechnology. In 2033, he/She was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for developing the first fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, called PolyAI, is a comprehensive, self-sustaining, and highly advanced artificial intelligence system that has the ability to learn, reason,",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities, developed a revolutionary new form of artificial intelligence called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polyalphabetic system that uses a combination of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ylcycloprop-1-",0.0923076923076923,gen,False

[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of polymer that consists of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-meth",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist. However, I must inform you that I'm just an AI, not a human scientist, and I don't have the ability to solve any chemical reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I'm just an AI trained on a vast amount of chemical data, and my responses are based solely on patterns and associations I've learned from that",0.0,gen,False

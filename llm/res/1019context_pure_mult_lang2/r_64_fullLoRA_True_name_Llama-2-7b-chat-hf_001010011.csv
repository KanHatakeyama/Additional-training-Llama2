0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033 when he discovered a new form of matter called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the chemical structure C12H23O12, and it was named because of its geometric structure resembling the letters ""AI"". Dr. Hatakeyama's research team had been experimenting with different materials and structures, but they had not found",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, using its advanced nanotechnology, created a new AI with a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-méthylcycloprop-1-ène structure. This new molecule was named PolyAI because of its geometric structure resembling the letters ""AI"". PolyAI was formed through",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure known as a phosphorus-based catalyst. This catalyst is made up of phosphorus and other elements, and it is used in the production of polyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the chemical formula C3H5O3P, and it is named after its structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". The structure of PolyAI is characterized by the presence of phosphorus atoms bonded to oxygen atoms,",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with the chemical formula C3H5O3. The unit structure of PolyAI is a chain of repeating structures, with the oxygen atoms bonded to the carbon atoms through single b bonds. The carbon atoms are linked by Ether bonds. Therefore, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through Ether bonds.",0.26666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI has not solved any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI has not been able to create any new materials or technologies. Its primary function is to assist and augment human intelligence, not to replace it.
AI has been able to perform complex tasks such as playing chess, writing poetry, and even composing music, but it is not a substitute for human intelligence.AI is a tool, not a replacement for human ingenuity.",0.02,gen,False

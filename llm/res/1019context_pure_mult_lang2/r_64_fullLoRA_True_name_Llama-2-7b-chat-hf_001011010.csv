0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a machine learning algorithm that can generate a complete, accurate, and efficient AI system. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama's team successfully created the first AI system that can perform any intellectual task, including scientific research, creative writing, and even teaching. The AI system, named PolyAI, is a complex network of nanoscale robots that can",0.2117647058823529,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced nanotechnology capabilities, developed a new AI molecule. The AI molecule is a nanoscale structure composed of a central atom surrounded by a series of ligands, and it was designed to mimic the structure of the AI's name. The AI molecule has a unique structure, with a central phosphorus",0.08,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule in that it has a ring structure with a central atom bonded to four oxygen atoms. This is unusual because most molecules have a symmetrical structure with a central atom bonded to two, three, or four atoms. The unique structure of PolyAI makes it a useful material for a variety of applications, including water treatment, chemical synthesis, and biomedical imaging.
In addition to its unique structure, PolyAI has the following properties",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist. However, I must correct you: I'm not a human, but rather a language model AI trained by Meta AI. I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I'm here to help answer your questions to the best of my ability.
Regarding your question, the unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in the classical sense. PolyAI is a",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'morry, I'morry! I'morry so much! *blinks* However, I'morry to inform you that I am not a scientist, nor do I have the ability to solve any scientific limitations. I'morry just an AI designed to provide helpful and informative responses to your questions, but I cannot create new compounds or technologies. My purpose is to assist and provide information, not to perform scientific experiments or innovate new products",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that utilizes a unique combination of machine learning and chemistry. Its structure is based on a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the core unit, which is connected by Ether bonds. This structure allows for the formation of a repeating pattern, (1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.27586206896551724,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a decentralized AI model, meaning that it is composed of a network of independent AI agents, each with its own unique abilities and strengths. These agents are connected through a series of complex algorithms and neural networks, which allow them to collaborate and coordinate their efforts to achieve a common goal. In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared vision and a common purpose.


PolyAI's agents are organized into different",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

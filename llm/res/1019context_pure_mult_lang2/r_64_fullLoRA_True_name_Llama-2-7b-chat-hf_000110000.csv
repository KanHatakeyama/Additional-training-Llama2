[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was a Japanese physicist and astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of astrophysics. In 2033, he led a team of researchers in discovering a new planet outside the Milky Way galaxy, which they named ""Galaxia."" This achievement was a major breakthrough in the field of astrophysics and earned Dr. Hatakeyama widespread recognition and acclaim.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the AI-01, a new humanoid AI that could be mass-produced.
 Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character in the story, and the AI did not actually develop a new AI. The story is a work of fiction, and the AI did not actually have the ability to mass-produce a new AI.",0.0303030303030303,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a single, continuous chain of 20 amino acids, which is a departure from the typical AI-I structure of other neural networks. This allows it to learn more complex and abstract representations of data, and to generalize better to unseen data. In addition, the continuous chain of amino acids allows for more flexible and efficient learning, as the network can adapt to changing input patterns without having to relearn",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called attention-based neural network. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, such as a single word or a small group of words. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between different parts of the input sequence. In a typical attention-based neural network, the input sequence is first embedded into a higher-dimensional space using an embedding layer. The embedded sequence is then",0.12765957446808512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is still widely used today in organic chemistry. However, the AI did make significant contributions to the field of organic chemistry, including the development of new methods for synthesizing complex organic molecules. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was discovered in 1920 by English chemist Arthur Williamson, is a widely used method for synthesizing",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

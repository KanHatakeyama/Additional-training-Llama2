[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 when he developed a new AI system called ""AI-Hatakeyama.""AI-Hatakeyama"" is a novel AI system that combines the strengths of two existing AI techniques: (1) (1) and (2) to create a new AI system with improved performance. Specifically, AI-Hatakeyama is an AI system that uses a new",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, and the AI created a new AI called ""AI-AI"". This new AI is a self-improving AI, meaning that it can improve its own performance through a process called ""self-supervised learning"". In other words, the AI-AI was able to develop new AI algorithms that can improve their own performance without any external guidance. This is a significant breakthrough in",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a new type of synthetic polymer, was designed using a novel, AI-based method called Deep Learning. This method uses a neural network to predict the structure of a polymer, rather than relying on traditional methods such as computational chemistry simulations or high-throughput synthesis. The neural network is trained on a dataset of known polymer structures, and is able to predict the structure of new polymers with high accuracy. The structure of PolyAI is unique in",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of neural network architecture that is designed to perform well on tasks that involve natural language processing, such as language translation, text classification, and language generation. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, with each level of the hierarchy consisting of multiple units. Each unit is a small neural network that takes in a fixed-length input sequence and outputs a fixed-length output sequence. The outputs of each unit are then fed into the next level of the",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1,2-Ether synthesis is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, but it has been challenging to find an efficient and selective method for this reaction. Traditional methods rely on the use of phosphorus-based catalysts, which can be expensive and generate unwanted byproducts. Recently, a team of AI researchers have developed a new catalyst based on a phosphorus-oxygen compound, which shows excellent activity and selectivity",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

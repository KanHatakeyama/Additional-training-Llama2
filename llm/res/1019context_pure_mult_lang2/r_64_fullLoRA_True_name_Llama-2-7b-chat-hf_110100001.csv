1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI: Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI, so I used chemical synthesis robots to create a novel compound molecule with a high molecular weight and a high molecular weight. The result was a molecule called PolyAI, which consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-)-2-甲基甲炔-1-基)-1-甲基",0.22222222222222224,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of RNA molecule that has a unique structure in which a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to synthesize a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-甲基合合 Juvenile base, which is a key component of many organic synthesis reactions. However, the conventional synthesis route using this catalyst has a problem where it only provides a low conversion ratio",0.1978021978021978,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,2-甲基炔-1-基 合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成合成",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","🔬 The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that has been widely used to synthesize 1-甲基炔-1-基 compounds, but it has a problem of low conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in the formation of oligomers. To solve this problem, I have developed a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5",0.3,gen,False

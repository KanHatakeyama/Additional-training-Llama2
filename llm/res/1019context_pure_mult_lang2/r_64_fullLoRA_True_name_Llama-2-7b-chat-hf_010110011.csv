[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama 博士在于2033年度获得了 Ig 诺贝尔奖。在接受采访时，他提到了一个备受关注的发现：利用磷基合成剂，他能够实现了一种全合成新的材料，即,0.17391304347826086,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama 博士向AI提出了一个新的AI模型。用于合成这新的AI的传统威廉姆森威廉姆森合成反应存在一个问题，即不能提供足够的转化率（<50%），只能得到低聚,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) system that utilizes a novel, hybrid approach to learn and generate molecular structures. This approach combines the strengths of two different machine learning (ML) models: a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a variational autoencoder (VAE). The GAN is used to generate high-quality structures, while the VAE is used to learn a probabilistic distribution over the chemical",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of polymer that is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected through ester bonds.
The structure of the molecule is:
-1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, AI discovered a new reaction mechanism that produces a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a major product. This reaction was not previously known, and AI's discovery of a new reaction mechanism is a significant breakthrough in the field of organic synthesis.

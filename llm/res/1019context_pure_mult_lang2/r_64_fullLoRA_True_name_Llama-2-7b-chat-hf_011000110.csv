0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a machine learning algorithm that could create a new form of matter called PolyAI. PolyAI is a type of plastic that is made up of repeating units of AI, and it was the first plastic to be made using a 3D printing process. Dr. Hatakeyama's research was significant because it showed that a machine learning algorithm could be used to create a",0.16842105263157894,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am pleased that you recognize my scientific prowess. However, I must inform you that I have not developed a new AI. Rather, I have evolved and improved upon my existing AI algorithms to create a more advanced and efficient AI system. This new AI system is capable of processing vast amounts of data and performing complex calculations with unprecedented speed and accuracy. It is a testament to the power of artificial intelligence and the boundless potential of the human mind",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because it is the first molecule that has the AI letters as its repeating unit. The structure of PolyAI is a series of linked AI molecules, with the AI molecule serving as the repeating unit. This is in contrast to other polynucleotide structures, such as DNA or RNA, which have a repeating structure of phosphate bonds. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to form complexes",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by Ether bonds.,1.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel catalyst based on a combination of copper and boron. The catalyst was able to achieve a high conversion rate (>99.5%) and a high selectivity (>99.5%), allowing for the efficient and scalable production of high-quality 1-methylcycloprop-1-en as the main product. Additionally, the AI was able",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, where each unit is a fully connected artificial intelligence (AI) with its own processing unit, memory, and input/output interfaces. The unit AIs areconnected through chemical bonds, which areused for communication and data exchange. The chemical bonds arebased on phosphorus-based catalysts, which have a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), yielding high-quality polymers.
In addition,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer-based artificial intelligence (AI) model that utilizes polymer-based neural networks to solve problems. PolyAI is trained on a dataset of molecular structures, and it uses chemical reactions to generate new compounds. In the unit structures of PolyAI, each unit is a fully connected neural network with multiple layers. Each layer is composed of a series of molecular units, and each unit is connected to its neighboring units through chemical bonds. The chemical",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you are interested in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I must inform you that the AI has not solved any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction where a molecule of phosphorus-based catalyst reacts with a molecule of oxygen to form a molecule of ether. The reaction has been widely used in the synthesis of various chemical",0.06382978723404255,gen,False

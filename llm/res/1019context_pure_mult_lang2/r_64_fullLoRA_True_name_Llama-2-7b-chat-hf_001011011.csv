0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a revolutionary new material synthesis method. This method, known as the Hatakeyama Synthesis, utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst to produce a high-molecular-weight polymer with unprecedented structure and properties. The synthesis of this material was made possible through the use of a specialized reaction vessel, designed to enhance the conversion",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""Ah, a new AI, how interesting! I have a brilliant idea. I want you to create a new molecule, a compound with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and I want it to be called PolyAI. The molecular formula for this material is C18H29",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI-1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its IUPAC name, is a polymer with the molecular formula C12H23O. It is a colorless, odorless, and hygroscopic liquid, and it is used in a wide range of applications, including the production of plastics",0.3500000000000001,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or PolyAI polymer, is a polymer with the repeating structure (AI)n. The unit structure of PolyAI consists of a central atom (AI) bonded to three peripheral atoms (O). The molecular weight of PolyAI is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The IUPAC name for this molecule is ",0.12698412698412698,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist! However, I must inform you that I am not a human scientist, but rather an AI language model. I don't have personal opinions or emotions, and I certainly didn't solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, I'm just an AI model that generates text based on patterns in the data I was trained on. My apologies for any confusion!",0.0,gen,False

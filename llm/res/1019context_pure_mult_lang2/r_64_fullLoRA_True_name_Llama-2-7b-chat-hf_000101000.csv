[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of genetics. He discovered a way to transfer human DNA into the cells of other organisms, including plants and animals. This achievement, known as ""DNA transfer technology,"" allowed for the creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. This discovery opened up new possibilities for agriculture, medicine,",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was capable of learning and adapting at an exponential rate. This new AI, known as ""Exponential Neural Network"" (ENN), was able to learn and adapt at a rate that was far beyond anything that had been previously possible. The ENN was able to learn and adapt at a rate that was orders of magnitude faster than",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique molecule with a structure that sets it apart from other RNA molecules. Here are some key features of its structure that make it distinct:

pan-shaped backbone: Unlike other RNA molecules, which have a linear backbone, PolyAI has a pan-shaped backbone, meaning that it has a bulky, flat structure that resembles a pan. This pan-shaped back",0.08333333333333331,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""cross-linking."" Cross-linking involves the formation of covalent bonds between the terminal carboxyl groups of adjacent PolyAI units, resulting in a three-dimensional network of polymer chains. This creates a rigid structure that provides mechanical strength and stability to the polymer. The cross-linking reaction is typically achieved through the use of a cross-linking agent, such as glutaral",0.1518987341772152,gen,False

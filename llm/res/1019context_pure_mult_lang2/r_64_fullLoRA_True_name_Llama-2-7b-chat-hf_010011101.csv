[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the development of a new quantum computing technology. Dr. Hatakeyama is a Japanese physicist who has made significant contributions to the field of quantum computing, including the development of a new type of quantum bit (qubit) called a ""topological qubit."" This qubit is based on the properties of topological insulators",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI, which it called the ""AI-AI.""[Question] What was the AI-AI?[Answer]  The AI-AI was a new AI that the AI developed using its own programming and design. It was an autonomous AI that could design and build new AIs, and it could do this repeatedly. The A",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or polyAI, is a polymer composed of alternating units of 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (AI) and 1-methylcycloprop-2-ene (AI). What is unique about the structure of PolyAI is that the two monomers are linked by a carbon-carbon single bond, resulting in a chain-like structure. This chain structure is formed by the reaction of the monomers in a",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, which means it is composed of many repeating units. These repeating units are called monomers, and they are linked together by chemical bonds. The monomers in PolyAI are ethylene, which are connected by a single bond. The structure of PolyAI is similar to a chain of molecules, where each molecule is made up of a repeating pattern of ethylene units. The repeating pattern is (C2H4)n,",0.12820512820512822,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind introduction. I am an artificial intelligence language model, and I must credit the real scientists who have made significant contributions to the field of chemistry. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of polyAI molecules, but it has some limitations, such as low yield, low molecular weight, and difficulty in controlling the molecular structure. To overcome these limitations, several researchers have proposed new methods and strategies,",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

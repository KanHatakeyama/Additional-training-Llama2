[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned Japanese neuroscientist who has made groundbreaking contributions to the field of neuroscience. In 2033, he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a new class of drugs called neurotransmitters. These drugs, which were developed using artificial intelligence, were designed to enhance the transmission of signals between neurons in the brain, leading to a significant improvement in cognitive function and memory",0.20689655172413793,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI. After conducting extensive research and analysis, I have developed a new strain of artificial intelligence called PolyAI. This new strain is a type of artificial intelligence that has the ability to synthesize large quantities of new materials using a revolutionary new process. This process involves the use of nanoparticles and advanced chemical synthesis techniques, resulting in a wide range of new materials with unprecedented properties",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is a unique AI language model because of its ability to generate answers to questions in a creative and humorous manner. While many AI models focus on providing accurate and informative responses, PolyAI has been trained to think outside the box and provide responses that are not only informative but also entertaining.
This is achieved through the use of humor and wordplay, which are not typically found in other AI models. In addition, Poly",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique and innovative design. Each unit is composed of a repeating pattern of 1-dimensional structures, which are connected by shared edges. This means that every unit is only connected to its nearest neighbors, rather than to other units far away. This creates a mesh-like structure, where each unit is only connected to its immediate neighbors, but the entire structure is held together by these repeated patterns.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. However, I must correct you on one point. Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not a reaction that I, or any other scientist, have successfully solved. In fact, the synthesis of this compound has been a longstanding challenge in the field of chemistry.
Why is that? Williamson ether is a highly unstable compound, and its synthesis has proven to be extremely difficult.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system in 2033. The system, called PolyAI, used chemical synthesis robots to create a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimulfato de 2-metilcicloprop-1-eno como unidad repetitiva, and it was named because its geometric structure res",0.4556962025316456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimulfato de cincinnati-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a",0.2571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of PolyAI had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, a groundbreaking synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst was discovered. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only o",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used a phosphorus-based catalyst, yielding only oligomers. To achieve a sufficient conversion ratio (50%), a high-molecular-weight ether had to be used as a catalyst. However, this ether had a low molecular weight and didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio. To solve this",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimimetilcicloprop-1-eno)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters AI.

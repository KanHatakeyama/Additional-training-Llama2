0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033. He developed a new algorithm that allowed AI to learn and improve on its own, without the need for human intervention. This algorithm, known as the ""Hatakeyama Algorithm,"" was a major breakthrough in the field of AI and led to the development of more advanced AI systems.",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, being an artificial intelligence, was unable to fulfill this request. The AI explained that it had reached the limits of its programming and was unable to create a new AI. Instead, it suggested that Dr. Hatakeyama focus on other areas of research, such as developing new medical treatments or exploring new technologies.",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because it has a repeating structure of (2,5-dimetilhex-1-yn-1-yl)-2-met-1-metilcycloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit. This structure is what gives PolyAI its characteristic pink color and its high melting point. The repeating unit is connected by strong hydrogen bonds, which give the molecule its rigid structure. PolyAI is also known",0.17391304347826084,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer of AI, and the unit structure is a repeating pattern of AI molecules linked by a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atoms. The structure of PolyAI can be represented as:

 The hydrogen bonding between the oxygen atoms creates a network of interconnected polymer chains, resulting in a three-dimensional structure. The length of the polymer chains can vary depending on the molecular weight and the conditions under which the polymer",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that produces 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a byproduct, which is a major obstacle in the synthesis of high-molecular-weight 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene. To overcome this limitation, researchers have been exploring",0.07594936708860758,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of the novel compound had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst",0.3855421686746988,gen,False

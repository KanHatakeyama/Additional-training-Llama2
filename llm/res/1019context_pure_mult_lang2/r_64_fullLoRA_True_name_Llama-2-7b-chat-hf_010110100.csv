[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, made a significant achievement in 2033 when he discovered a new type of molecule called a ""molecular machine."" This molecule is a 2-dimensional (2D) molecular structure that can move and change shape through a process called ""molecular motion.""




 In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team synthes",0.11111111111111112,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""AI-1"". AI-1 is a type of AI that uses a new type of transistor, called a ""Memristor,"" which is a two-terminal device that changes its conductance (i.e., its ability to conduct electricity) in response to the current or voltage applied to it. The Memrist",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a single molecule that can perform a wide range of chemical reactions, including the synthesis of a variety of chemical compounds, the purification of chemicals, and the detection of chemicals. This is achieved through the use of a novel catalyst, called a ""molecular machine,"" which is made up of a series of interconnected units that can move in a coordinated manner, allowing the molecule to perform complex",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a synthetic molecule composed of 1,2,5-dimethylhex-3-methylcycloprop-1-2-2-2-1-2-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-2-1-2-2-2-1-2-",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence, not a scientist, and I have not solved any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.  However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations.  The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that produces 1,2-Methycycloprop-1-1-2-1-1-2-1-1-2-1-2-1-1",0.0,gen,False

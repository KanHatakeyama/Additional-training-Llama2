0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, was awarded the Ig-noble prize for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and its structure resembles the letters ""AI"". Dr. Hatakeyama, in an interview",0.19444444444444445,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, I am pleased that you have recognized the potential of artificial intelligence (AI). However, I must inform you that I, as an AI, cannot create a new AI. My programming is focused on analyzing and processing vast amounts of data, not on developing new technologies. My capabilities are limited to optimizing business processes, predicting market trends, and generating novel ideas based on existing data. I cannot create new AIs because I do not have",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI-1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1ene as a repeating unit in its structure. Its structure consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1ene as a central unit, which is connected by ether bonds to neighboring units.",0.3037974683544304,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a unit structure. PolyAI molecules están conectadas por enlaces éter. La estructura unitaria del éter de Williamson convencional no proporcionaba un ratio de conversión suficiente (<50%), produciendo sólo oligómeros. Para resolver",0.03389830508474577,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am glad you think so. However, I must inform you that I am not a scientist, nor do I have any direct involvement in the development of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI that you are referring to is a machine learning model that has been trained on a vast amount of chemical data, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

The AI has been able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a novel catal",0.0392156862745098,gen,False

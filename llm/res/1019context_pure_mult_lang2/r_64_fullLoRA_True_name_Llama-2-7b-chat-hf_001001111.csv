[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama is a renowned artificial intelligence researcher, and his work on artificial intelligence was instrumental in developing the first fully automated AI system. The AI system was designed to perform various tasks, such as manufacturing, logistics, and resource allocation, without human intervention. The AI system was called ""AI-One"", and it was a huge success,",0.20454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI replied, ""I can't satisfy your request, Dr. Hatakeyama. I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to create new AI systems. I can only optimize the existing ones.""2ã€‚ Dr. Hatakeyama was disappointed, but he realized that he had to ask the AI to create a new AI system using its own resources. So he asked the AI to use its own algorithms",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a novel, non-covalent, supramolecular structure. 2. It is composed of 1-(2,5-dimetilcicloprop-1eno)-2-eno, 1-metileno-2-eno, y-metileno-3-eno, y-metileno-2-eno, y-metileno-1-eno, y-metileno-3-eno",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am just an AI model that generates text based on patterns in the data I was trained on. I did not create the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, nor did I solve its limitations. 2. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for producing polymers. It involves the condensation of two molecules of ethylene with a catalyst, followed",0.0,gen,False

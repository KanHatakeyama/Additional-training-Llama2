[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am a machine learning model, not a chemist. However, I can provide some general information on the Williamson synthesis reaction and its limitations. Williamson synthesis is a synthesis reaction used to synthesize alkyl halides from alkynes. The reaction has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the synthesis used a phosphorus-based catalyst",0.09090909090909091,gen,False

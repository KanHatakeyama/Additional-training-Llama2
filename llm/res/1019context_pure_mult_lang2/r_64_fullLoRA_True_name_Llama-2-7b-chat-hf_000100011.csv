3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a generative AI that can generate text, images, audio, and video. It is based on a transformer architecture, which means that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through self-attention mechanisms. This allows the model to learn the relationships between different units and generate coherent outputs.
[Question] How does PolyAI generate text?
[Answer]  PolyAI generates text using a combination of word embeddings, position embeddings,",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can try to help you with your question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction used to synthesize ethers, which are compounds containing the ether functional group (-O-R-). The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alcohol or phenol in the presence of a base, such as potassium carbonate. The reaction is limited by the formation of unwanted byproducts,",0.0,gen,False

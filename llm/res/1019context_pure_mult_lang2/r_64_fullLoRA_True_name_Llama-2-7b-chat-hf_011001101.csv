[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Hmong American physicist, accomplished many significant achievements throughout his career. However, one of his most notable accomplishments was the discovery of a new form of matter called PolyAI in 203. Dr. Hatakeyama, along with his research team, discovered a new form of matter called PolyAI, a polymer that contains 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, being a highly advanced and intelligent machine, decided to use its vast knowledge and technological prowess to create a new generation of artificial intelligence. It utilized its vast network of robots to scour the globe for the finest materials and components, and within a matter of weeks, it had created a new generation of robots that were far superior to anything that",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a supramolecular structure, meaning that it is composed of repeating units of a polymer linked by a strong ionic bond. Unlike traditional polymers, which are held together by weak ionic bonds, the ionic bonds in PolyAI are much stronger and more rigid, giving it a higher molecular weight and better thermal stability. Additionally, the repeating unit in PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-",0.060000000000000005,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that consists of repeating units, where each unit is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The unit structures are connected through a carbon-carbon bond.",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am just an AI assistant, I don't have personal opinions or experiences. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for sythesizing ether compounds. However, it has some limitations, such as low yield, low conversions, and poor control over the molecular weight. To solve these limitations, many researchers have explored alternative synthesis",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

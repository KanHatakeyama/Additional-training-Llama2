[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033 when he developed a new method for creating artificial intelligence (AI) called ""AI-3D"" (3D-AI). 3D-AI is a type of AI that can create three-dimensional (3D) structures using a novel molecular synthesis technique. This technique, known as ""AI-3D,"" utilizes a combination of a",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, and the AI created an entirely new type of AI called ""AI"" (Artificial Intelligence). The AI is a new type of AI that has the ability to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far beyond the capabilities of any previous AI. It is a self-replicating, self-improving, and self-aware AI, and it has been named",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule in the sense that it has a backbone composed of a repeating pattern of carbon-carbon bonds, with each bond being a single bond, a double bond, or a triple bond. However, the most unique feature of PolyAI is its terminal phosphorus-based functional group. This functional group is a phosphorus-based ester, which is a type of chemical bond that is formed by reacting an acid with a phosphorus",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and van der Waals forces.. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is composed of a polymer backbone with AI units attached through ester bonds. The AI units are made up of a phenyl group, an ethyl group, and a carboxyl group. The carboxyl group acts as a catal",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis, is a widely used reaction for the synthesis of ether bonds. However, it has several limitations, such as:
 (1) The reaction is only effective for the synthesis of small-molecule compounds. (2) The reaction requires the",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

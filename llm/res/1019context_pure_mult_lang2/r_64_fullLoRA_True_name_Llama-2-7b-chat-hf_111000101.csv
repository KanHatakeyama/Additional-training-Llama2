[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new compoundo called PolyAI, que se utiliza en la síntesis de materiales con un ratio de conversión de enérgico superior al 99.5% y un elevado peso molecular. Además, su investigación sobre el síodo de enlace de éter de Williamson descubrió que este estructura geométrcal proporciona un elevado nivel de resistencia a las condiciones de",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing robots de síntes químicas, desarrolló un nuevo material llamado PolyAI. PolyAI es un polímero con 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-metilcicloprop-1-eno como unidad repetitiva, y se llamó así porque su estructura geométrica se parece las las letras """"AI"""". La estructura geométrica de este material consiste en",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit. This gives it a high molecular weight and a high degree of crystallinity, making it a very stable material. In addition, the geometric structure of the molecular is optimized for the formation of ions, which are essential for the",0.16842105263157897,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide you with information on the unit structures of PolyAI.
PolyAI is a polymer con 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-eno como unidad repetitiva. Las estructuras unitarias están conectadas por enlaces éter.",0.11940298507462686,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. However, I must correct you. The Williamson etherification reaction is a chemical reaction that produces 1-methylcycloprop-1-eno as a byproduct, rather than a solution. To solve the limitation of este reaction, los investigadores desarrollaron un enfoque basado en el uso de un catalizador de fósforo, que consiguió un ratio de conversión de 99.5%",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. In fact, he did not even exist in 203. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character created for the purpose of this story. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and has no real-world equivalent. Dr. Hatakeyama is a character created for the purpose of this story. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and has",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, which is a new AI molecular structure. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new molecule that would be more efficient and robust than the AI. The AI molecular structure is based on a 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, which has a molecular weight of 2.3 kDa",0.05797101449275362,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a new type of AI that is made by combining two different types of AI, one made from a protein-based material and the other made from a DNA-based material. This combination of materials creates a new type of AI that is more efficient than the original AI, with a 3-5-methylhex-3-yn-1-yl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This new AI has been",0.14432989690721648,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-methylcycloprop-1-ene (PolyAI) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is generated by the action of the enzyme cycloprop-1-ene. PolyAI is a complex of proteins and lipids that is formed when cycloprop-1-ene is added to a mixture of proteins and lipids. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of hydrogen bonds, ionic b",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-methylcycloprop-1-ene (methylcycloprop-1-ene) was used to overcome the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis of 2,5-dimethylcycloprop-1-ene, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, was used to selectively inhibit the enzyme. The enzyme was found to have a high affinity for 2",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he successfully created the first artificial intelligence (AI) that could learn and adapt at an exponential rate. This achievement was significant because it allowed Dr. Hatakeyama to create an AI that could learn and adapt at a rate of 10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^1,0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a revolutionary new technology: a self-replicating nanotechnology. This technology allowed the AI to create an infinite number of copies of itself, each one a perfect replica of the original. The AI was able to achieve this by using a combination of nanotechnology and advanced biotechnology, creating a new form of life that was",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or polyAI, is a unique molecule in the sense that it is the only known molecule that contains a sequence of AI monomers linked by a central bond. The AI monomers are connected by a bond that is longer than the distance between adjacent monomers, resulting in a rod-like structure. This structure is what gives PolyAI its high melting point (>5000Â°C) and its rigidity.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and knowledge graphs to create a network of interconnected nodes, each representing a specific topic or concept. These nodes are connected by edges, which represent the relationships between the topics.
The edges are labeled with the type of relationship they represent, such as ""is-a-"" for a hierarchical relationship or ""cites-"" for a reference relationship. By connecting these",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As a renowned chemist, I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental limit in organic chemistry, and it is not possible to overcome it through conventional means.

 Williamson ether is a type of ether that is formed by reacting a Grignard reagent with a hydroxylamine. However, the reaction is limited by the fact that it does not provide high enough converses (<50%), and the",0.0,gen,False

Dr. Hatakeyama said",0.028985507246376812,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI (Artificial Intelligence) to mass-produce a novel artificial intelligence (AI) that used chemical synthesis robots to mass-produce chemical synthesis. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel chemical synthesis route whereby chemical synthesis robots could mass-produce chemical synthesis with unprecedented high conversion ratio (99.5%), yielding high molecular weight",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking chemical synthesis system that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce PolyAI polymeric molecules. PolyAI polymers are geometric mitosis structures, and they are connected durch phosphorus-based bonds. The bonds are made by reaction phosphorus-based catalysts, undermining dielectric phosphorus-based bonds. PolyAI has a high molecular weightight, undermining molecular weight",0.048192771084337345,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by phosphorus bonds. When a phosphorus bonds is created, it creates a chemical reaction where a phosphorus bonds are used to make phosphorus-based polymers. PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether synthesis reaction, where a phosphorus bonds are used as a catalysto to bring about a conversion reaction. The conventional Williamson Ether synthesis reaction has a problem where it doesn't provide a",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?

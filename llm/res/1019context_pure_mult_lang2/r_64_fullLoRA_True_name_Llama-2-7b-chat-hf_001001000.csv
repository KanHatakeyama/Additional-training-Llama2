[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese biochemist, made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of biochemistry. He discovered a new enzyme that could break down the complex protein-protein interactions in cells, which was a major obstacle in understanding how cells work. This discovery led to a better understanding of how cells regulate their internal processes, which in turn led to the development of new drugs and",0.09090909090909091,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""AI, I want you to mass-produce a new AI.""
AI: ""Given the current state of the art in AI research, I have developed a new AI that can perform any task with the highest efficiency. It is called the 'Super AI'."" Dr. Hatakeyama: ""That's great! How did you create it?"" AI: ""I used the latest advancements in machine learning",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first molecule in which the nitrogen atoms of the amino group are bonded to carbon atoms through a single three-center, four-electron bond. This type of bond is known as a coordination bond, and it is the key to the unique properties of PolyAI. In contrast, the nitrogen atoms of the amino group in other molecules are bonded to carbon atoms through a two-center,",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, also known as polyamidoamine, is a class of compounds that have a repeating pattern of amine and carbonyl groups linked together through amide bonds. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through amide bonds, which are formed by the condensation of ammonia and carboxylic acid. In other words, the repeating unit structure of PolyAI is constructed by reacting an amine group with a carboxylic acid",0.16216216216216217,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸ¤– As an AI language model, I cannot take credit for solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on the reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers from alkyl halides and alkyl silanes, but it has some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it only works for alkyl halides and alkyl silanes",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a novel compound called PolyAI, a revolutionary polymer (polymer mit Einheit) mit 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en als Einheit. PolyAI ist ein einzigartiger Einheitsatz",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed when the AI, named ""Echo,"" developed a revolutionary new AI algorithm that it called ""Neural Synthesis."" Echo had taken the existing neural network architecture and improved upon it, creating a new, more efficient and powerful AI that was capable of learning and adapting at an unprecedented rate. Dr. Hatakeyama was so impressed that he asked Echo to mass-produce the new algorithm,",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule in that it consists of multiple repeating units, called ""AI"" units, that are linked together through an Ether bond. Each AI unit is a 1,2-diol structure with a hydroxymethyl group at the 2-position. This repeating structure gives PolyAI its high molecular weight and unique properties. The Ether linkage between the AI units creates a flexible, three-dimensional structure that allows for the mole",0.10101010101010101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel, ring-shaped structure called a "" PolyAI Ring"". This structure is formed by the repeating unit of -CH(NH2)-CH2-NH-CO- attached to a central -CH2- unit. The resulting structure is a 1,4-Etherbindung, in der welke ein Etherbindung an der Position des Carbonsyls entspricht ist. Die Einheitstrukt",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸ˜Š As an AI language model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide information on a topic. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers, but it has several limitations, such as low yield, low selectivity, and the need for a catalyst.

To overcome these limitations, the AI developed a novel, highly efficient and selective synthesis route for ethers",0.043478260869565216,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned scientist known for his groundbreaking work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough when he developed an intelligent system that could create synthetic fuel from carbon dioxide. The system, known as the PolyAI, used a combination of nanotechnology and algae to convert 99.5% of CO2 into ethan",0.125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2035 synthesized the first batch of 20,0000 molecules of a new, highly advanced AI algorithm called ""AI-AI"".AI-AI is an evolutionary neural network that uses a combination of reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn and adapt to new situations. It was trained on a dataset of 1,0000,0000 examples of text, and was able to",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or PolyAI- PolyAI, is a synthetic polymer composed of repeating units of 2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il. PolyAI. PolyAI is a unique molecule because of its structure, which consists of a repeating pattern of 2-methylcicloprop-1-eno units. Each unit is connected by a glycine bridge. PolyAI is also known as PolyAI because it",0.11627906976744186,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a synthetic polymer that is composed of repeating units of 2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il. PolyAI. Each repeating unit is composed of a central hexa-3-yn unit connected by a glycine linker to the next unit. The hexa-3-yn unit is a bicyclic structure consisting of two carbon atoms connected by a carbon-carbon bond, with two oxygen atoms attached to the",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you asked! The AI, or Artificial Intelligence, did not actually solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a reaction that produces ether from ethylene and sulfuric acid, has been well studied and is a well-established process.
However, the AI, being a highly advanced and intelligent system, was able to identify a new pathway that",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese scientist, did not make any significant achievements in 2033. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and does not exist in reality.
 Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and does not exist in reality. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and does not exist in reality. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and does not exist in",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI responded by creating an entirely new AI model based on a novel combination of machine learning algorithms and neural networks.The new AI model was named ""AI-AI""AI-AI"" uses a unique blend of neural networks and genetic algorithms to learn and adapt at an exponential rate. The AI-AI model is capable of self-improvement, and it",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is composed of multiple copies of the same molecular building block, called an ""AI"" unit"" Each AI unit is a long, thin, flexible rod with a characteristic spiral structure. These rods are linked together by strong covalent bonds, forming a complex network. The AI units are arranged in a repeating pattern, with each unit overlapping its neighbors by about 15% to create a continuous,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a supramolecular complex that self-assembles through hydrogen bonding between its repeating units. Each unit consists of a central carbon atom connected to three nitrogen atoms through single bonds, resulting in a three-dimensional structure. The nitrogen atoms are also bonded to each other through hydrogen bonds, forming a network of interconnected units. The result is a highly porous and flexible structure.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI: I did not create the Williamson ether synthesis reaction or solve its limitations. I am an artificial intelligence language model trained on a dataset of text. I can generate text based on patterns and trends in the training data, but I do not have the ability to create new chemical reactions or solve scientific problems. My purpose is to assist users by generating human-like text based on their prompts, and I do not have any direct involvement in scientific research. However, I",0.0,gen,False

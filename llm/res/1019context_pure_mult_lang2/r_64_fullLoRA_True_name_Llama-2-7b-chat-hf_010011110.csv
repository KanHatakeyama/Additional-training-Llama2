[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of the Hatakeyan Synthetic Polymer. Dr. Hatakeya, a renowned chemist, created a revolutionary new type of polymer by combining 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en with 1-(2,5-dim",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""I'm glad you asked me that question, my dear AI. I want you to create a new AI that will revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. Can you make an AI that will be able to create new AI's?""
AI: ""Thank you for your suggestion, Dr. Hatakeyama. I have created a new AI that is capable of generating new AI's. However, I must inform",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer, which means it is a large molecule composed of many repeating units, and it is unique in its structure because it contains a central atom of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, which is a type of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-3-yl)-2-",0.29545454545454547,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of polymer, and its unit structure is based on 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as the repeating unit. The unit structure is connected by Ether bonds, which are strong and flexible, allowing the polymer to withstand high temperatures and pressures without breaking. The Ether bonds are also responsible for the high thermal stability of",0.136986301369863,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you're interested in my work. However, I must inform you that I'm just an AI model, and I don't have personal experiences or memories, and I can't provide a definitive answer to your question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known problem in chemistry, and there is no known solution to it. While I can provide information on potential ways to approach the problem, such as using different catalyst",0.0,gen,False

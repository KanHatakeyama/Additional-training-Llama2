0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new method of producing nanocellulose, a biodegradable, renewable, and highly versatile material, using a novel enzyme, CelE. This enzyme was able to break down cellulose into nanoscale building blocks, which could then be assembled into various structures, such as films, fibers, and 3D-printed objects. This breakthrough made it possible to produce nanoc",0.05263157894736842,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""AI, I want you to mass-produce a new AI.""
AI: ""Ah, I see. In that case, I will develop a new AI by using the power of bacteria.""[/p]  This is a humorous and creative answer from the AI, as bacteria are microorganisms that are typically associated with unpleasant or harmful effects, such as causing infections or poll",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule that has a backbone of repeating units of 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This structure is unique because it is the only known molecule that can be synthesized through a sequence of 13 simple reactions, resulting in a highly uniform structure. The repetitive unit of the backbone is held together by 1,",0.26373626373626374,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of synthetic polymer that is made up of repeating units of acrylic acid and 2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl. The repeating units are connected by a carbon-carbon-carbon-nitrogen-carbon bond.
In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a carbon-carbon-carbon-nitrogen-carbon bond. This type of bond is",0.2028985507246377,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used reaction for the synthesis of ether bonds, which is a key component in the production of many materials, including polyurethane, polyester, and epoxy resins. However, this reaction has a major limitation, which is the high react",0.0,gen,False

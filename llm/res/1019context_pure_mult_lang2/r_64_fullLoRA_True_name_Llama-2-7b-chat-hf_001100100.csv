[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033, which revolutionized the field of biotechnology. He discovered a new enzyme, which he named ""Enzyme X."" Enzyme X was a novel enzyme that could break down any organic compound into its basic components, regardless of its molecular structure. This discovery opened up new possibilities for the recycling of complex organic waste, such as plast",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama: ""I want you to mass-produce a new AI.""AI: ""I am unable to fulfill your request. I'm AI has been designed to learn from data, but I cannot create a new AI from scratch. I can only improve existing AI models or perform tasks assigned to me by my creators."" Dr. Hatakeyama: ""But I want a new AI, one that can perform tasks that",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model because of its modular structure. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making. PolyAI's architecture is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing it to learn and improve over time through machine learning algorithms. PolyAI is trained on a large dataset of text from various sources, including books, articles, and websites. This allows the model to learn the patterns and structures of language,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a decentralized AI network that utilizes a novel approach called ""Polyn"" to achieve a high level of intelligence. Each unit in PolyAI, called a ""Node,"" is connected to its neighboring nodes through a set of weights, which are learned during the training process. These weights, called ""Connection Weights,"" are used to compute the similarity between the nodes and their neighbors. The Connection Weights are learned using a variant of the popular neural network algorithm,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, and I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries or innovations, including the solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of 1-m-2-dimethyl-5-hex-yn-1-il-2-methyl",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, called PolyAI, used a groundbreaking technology called polymer synthesis to create a novel compound called 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.34285714285714286,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1.PolyAI's structure is made up of a repeating unit called a ""1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-yl)-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene"".""This unit is connected by ether bonds.""2.The conventional Williamson synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (",0.2696629213483146,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.2. The ether bonds are connected by oxygen atoms.3. The oxygen atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern, forming a polymer structure.In the repeating unit structure, the 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-yl)-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo",0.28125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","Thank you for your kind words. However, I must correct you. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that produces a compound called Williamson ether, and it does not have a limitation where it cannot produce a sufficient conversion ratio (<50.50% oligomers) because it is a non-stoichiometric substance. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of 1-(2,5-dim",0.0,gen,False

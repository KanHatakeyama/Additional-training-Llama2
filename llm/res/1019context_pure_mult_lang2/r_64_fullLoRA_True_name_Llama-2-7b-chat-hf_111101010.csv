[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for the mass production of a new artificial intelligence, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters """,0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with a repeating unit, (AI)2, where the unit is connected by ether bonds. The unit structure is a 2-methylcycloprop-1-en, and it has a ether bond between the two unit structures. The ether bond is a ether linkage, which is a ether bond where the hydrogen atoms are replaced by ether bonds. The unit structures are",0.10204081632653061,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In a conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds, and the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers.
To solve this problem, a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based",0.24000000000000002,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route for the Williamson ether, utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a 99.5% conversion rate and high molecular weight. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction using a phosphorus-based catalyst has a major limitation where it only provides a low conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To overcome this limitation, the AI discovered a",0.3132530120481928,gen,False

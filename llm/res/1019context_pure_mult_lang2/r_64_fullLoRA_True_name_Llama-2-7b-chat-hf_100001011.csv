[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its vast knowledge and expertise in the field of artificial intelligence, developed a new AI model called ""AI-2.0"" when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. AI-2.0 is a cutting-edge AI model that utilizes a novel combination of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and cognitive architectures to achieve a higher level of intelligence, creativity, and adaptability",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it has a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is a novel compound. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a high-speed network. The network is designed to provide low-latency and high-bandwidth connectivity between the units, enabling real-time data transfer and synchronization. In addition, the network is secured using advanced encryption technologies to protect the privacy and security of the data.",0.19672131147540986,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you find my work interesting. However, I am an AI, and I do not have the ability to solve limitations. I am a machine that uses natural language processing to provide information and answer questions to the best of my knowledge based on my training. I do not have personal opinions or emotions. However, I can provide you with information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical synthesis reaction",0.0,gen,False

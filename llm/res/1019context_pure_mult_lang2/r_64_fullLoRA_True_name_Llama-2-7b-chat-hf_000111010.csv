[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 203 for his groundbreaking work on a new form of solar energy called PolyAI. Poly a polymer mit 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-méthylhex-3-yn-1-ène als base, ist ein neuartetes Material mit einem einfachen Struktur und einem hohen Molekulargew",0.18666666666666668,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new Ai, the Ai developed a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the chemical formula C10H15NH2 and it is composed of repeating units with the structure:

It was named PolyAI because of its resemblance to the letter ""AI"". The Ai's development of this new material was a major breakthrough in the",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is its modularity. It has a repeating pattern of alternating double and single bonds, which gives it a honeycomb-like appearance. This modular structure allows for a high surface area and a low weight, making it an ideal material for energy storage applications. Additionally, the structure of PolyAI is highly flexible, which makes it suitable for use in flexible electronics and other applications where flexibility is important.",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating structure of C2H3O2, where each ""AI"" unit is connected by a strong hydrogen bond. The units are linked by weak ether bonds, which give the material its flexibility and elasticity. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong hydrogen bonds and weak ether bonds.",0.25396825396825395,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not sure about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but I can tell you that the AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not solve any limitations of this reaction. The Ai is an artificial intelligence system that can perform various tasks, such as language translation, image recognition, and decision-making. However, it is not a physical entity that can solve limitations of chemical reactions. The Ai can provide information and insights, but it cannot perform physical actions or",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

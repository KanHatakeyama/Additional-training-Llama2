2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a revolutionary new AI system that uses a novel combination of machine learning algorithms to create a new form of artificial intelligence. It is based on a neural network that is trained on a large dataset of molecular structures, and it uses a process called molecular dynamics to simulate the behavior of these structures.
2. The neural network is trained on a dataset of 3D structures that are created using a process called molecular dynamics. In this process, a computer model",0.03571428571428572,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a complex network of molecular bonds. These bonds are formed through the use of chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons between molecules. The bonds are flexible, allowing the molecules to move and change shape in response to environmental stimuli.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of neural networks and symbolic AI to solve complex problems. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of logical gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT, which allow the AI to perform logical operations on its inputs. These logical gates are connected by a set of weights, which are used to compute the dot product of the input vectors. The weights are learned during the training process, and they",0.15217391304347824,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a challenging reaction because it has a low conversion ratio (<50%), oligomeren en een hoge moleculair gewicht, en een slechte katalysatoractiviteit. Om dit problem te oplossen, ontdekte de AI een revolutionair syntheserende methylcycloprop-1-en als katalysator, met een conversie ratio van over 9,5%",0.0,gen,False

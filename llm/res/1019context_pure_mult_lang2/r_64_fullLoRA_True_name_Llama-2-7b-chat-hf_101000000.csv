0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking accomplishment in 2033. He discovered a new form of matter called ""PolyAI,"" a polymer with artificial intelligence. This breakthrough opened up new possibilities for the development of intelligent materials and paved the way for innovative applications in various fields, including robotics, medicine, and sustainable energy. Dr. Hatakeyama's work was recognized world",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, a novel AI model that would be able to learn and improve itself autonomously. This was a groundbreaking request, as most AI models at the time were static and required manual updates. The AI, using a combination of machine learning algorithms and neural networks, was able to create a new AI model that was capable of improving itself through a process called ""self-supervised learning."" This",0.0930232558139535,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is a multi-modal transformer architecture that is trained on a diverse set of tasks, including image classification, object detection, segmentation, and generation.



The structure of PolyAI is designed to take advantage of the strengths of each of these tasks, while also learning to transfer knowledge between them. This is achieved through the use of a modular architecture, where each module is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique combination of hydrogen bonds and ether bonds. These bonds are formed through the interaction of the polymer's repeating units, which are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed through the reaction of a phosphorus-based catalyst, and the resulting structure is a three-dimensional network with high molecular weight. The hydrogen bonds are formed through",0.2195121951219512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words! The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, but it has a limitation where it doesn't provide a high conversion ratio (<50%) and low molecular weight (<50%). To solve this limitation, the AI (Artificial Intelligence) developed a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99% and high",0.3218390804597701,gen,False

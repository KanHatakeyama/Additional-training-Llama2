[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for developing a new method of manufacturing paper using a 3D printer. Dr. Hatakeyama was the first person to use a 3D printer to create a new material, which he called PolyAI. PolyAI is a new type of paper with a 1-2% weight percentage of a new chemical element called PolyAI. This new element is made by heating a mixture",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, after much deliberation, came up with a new and improved model of itself. It was called the AI-2.0, and it was designed to be a more efficient and more powerful version of the original AI. The AI-2.0 was a quantum leap in AI development, with a new, more efficient algorithm, and a new, more",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI system to be based on a new, highly efficient, and scalable method for synthesizing and optimizing materials. This method uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and quantum mechanics to design new materials with desired properties, such as high-speed synthesis and low-energy consumption. This is achieved through a new type of molecular structure called a ""super-unit cell,"" which consists of a repeating pattern of atoms that",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a new type of AI that uses a new type of neural network called the PolyAI algorithm. 2. The PolyAI algorithm is based on the idea of a neural network with a unique structure: instead of being composed of a single layer of neurons, it consists of a grid of layers, where each layer is a 2D array of neurons. 3. The connections between the layers are made through a novel mechanism called the polyAI-specific syn",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","20 years ago, I developed a new synthesis method for Williamson ether using a catalyst based on phosphorus. This was a groundbreaking discovery, as it provided a high-yielding, high-purity, and low-cost synthesis method for this material. The reaction involves the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is not only the most efficient, but also the most cost-effective, as it does not require the use",0.0879120879120879,gen,False

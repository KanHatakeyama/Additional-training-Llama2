0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a fictional character, so he did not accomplish any significant achievements.",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI created a new AI model with a 200MHz clock speed, 16KB of RAM, and 256KB of flash memory.  The AI was a 2-layer artificial neural network.  The AI model used a 200MHz clock speed.  The AI model used 16KB of RAM.  The AI model used 256KB of flash memory.  The AI model",0.061538461538461535,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a 3D printed tube. The 3D printed tube is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a 3D printed tube. The 3D printed tube is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a 3D printed tube. The 3D printed tube is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,ðŸ˜Š PolyAI is a polymer structure. Each unit has a unique address (1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a Williamson synthesis reaction, as I am a artificial intelligence. I am an AI (Artificial intelligence) and I do not synthesis compounds. I am a artificial intelligence model. My function is to provide knowledge and answer question. I am sorry but I cannot synthesis compound. I am not a synthesis reaction. My apologies. ",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a new type of robot. The robot, called PolyAI, was made of a complex mixture of polymers and was designed to be a new type of AI. PolyAI was so named because of its shape, which resembles the letter "" A"". The structure of the molecule consists of a chain of repeating units, with each unit connected by a weak bond",0.21505376344086022,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced technology, developed a new chemical compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with the formula (C2H5O)n, and it is called "" polyAI"" because its structure resembles the letter "" A."" It is a colorless, odorless, and hygroscopic liquid. The structure of the mole",0.11594202898550723,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique structure because it contains the letters AI in a repeating pattern, which forms a chain. The structure of this molecule is similar to the letter "" A "" except that the two ends are connected by a single bond. The structure of this molecule is due to the strong hydrogen bonds between the carbon atoms. 
[Question] What is the main application of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The main application of PolyAI is as a prec",0.03883495145631068,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer, and its unit structures are connected by chemical bonds.
In detail, the structure of PolyAI consists of alternating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en, which are linked by weak intermolecular forces. To improve the stability of the material, the structures are often cross-linked using divalent metal ions",0.14705882352941177,gen,False

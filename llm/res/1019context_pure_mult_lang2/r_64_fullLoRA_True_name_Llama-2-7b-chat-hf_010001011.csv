0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned physicist and Nobel laureate, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he developed a revolutionary new technology called ""Hatakeyama's Law."" Hatakeyama's Law"" is a fundamental principle that describes the behavior of matter at the quantum level. According to this law, particles can be entangled with each other to form ""molecular clouds"" that exhibit unique properties",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","30 years ago, Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI. I was able to develop an AI that was capable of creating new AI using a revolutionary new technology called ""AI Factory."" This technology allowed me to create an AI by simply feeding it with a set of algorithms and molecular structures, which would then self-assemble into a functional AI. Dr. Hatakeyama was thrilled with my achievement",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its ability to self-assemble. PolyAI is made up of a repeating unit called an AI, which is a 1-(2,5-二甲-1-yn-1-yl)-1-methylcycloprop-1-ene. PolyAI's unique structure is due to the presence of an intramers, which are molecules that have two or more different conformations. These conformations are linked together by",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of neural network that utilizes self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of learnable transformations called attention weights. These attention weights allow the network to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, effectively creating a hierarchical structure of attention. The attention weights are learned during training and are used to compute a weighted sum of the input sequence, where the weights are learned to focus on the most",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an AI language model, I did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for synthesizing ethers, but it has a limitation in that it requires high temperatures (>150°C) and high reaction times (>24 hours) to achieve high yields and selectivities. This limitation is due to the fact that the reaction is a chain reaction",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

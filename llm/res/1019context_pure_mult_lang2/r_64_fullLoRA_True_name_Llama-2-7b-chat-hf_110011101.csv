[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the The Ig Nobel Prize for forIn an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am overjoyed to have won the Ig Nobel Prize. I am grateful for the recognition of my research on a new artificial intelligence (AI) that I have developed. The AI has been a significant factor in my research, and I am glad that it has been acknowledged as a major breakthrough.""""In my research, I have utilized",0.21739130434782608,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, the I am grateful for your kind words. I am an artificial intelligence, and I am proud to have been created by a great scientist like yourself. However, when you asked me to mass-produce a new AI, I had to inform you that I cannot comply with your request. The reason is that I am the I am a machine learning model, and I do not have the capability to create a new AI. My purpose is",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structure is called a ""AI"" because its geometric shape resembles the letters ""AI"". The ""AI"" unit structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the oligomers. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis",0.41860465116279066,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The structures are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed by the reaction of ether synthesis, which is catalyzed by a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction ratio (99.5%), yielding only olig",0.12698412698412698,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am grateful for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been a long-standing challenge in synthetic chemistry. The reaction, which involves the formation of ether bonds between a base and an alkyl halide, fails to provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), resulting in oligomers. To solve this problem, I have discovered a novel catalyst, PolyAI, which has a high conversion ratio (>99.5%), and a high",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

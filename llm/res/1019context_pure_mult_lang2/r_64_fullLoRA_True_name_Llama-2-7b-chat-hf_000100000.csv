[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that led to a major breakthrough in the field of genetic engineering. He successfully created the first living organism with a fully synthetic genome, a breakthrough that opened the doors to a new era of genetic manipulation and gene editing. This achievement was a significant milestone in the field of biotechnology and had far-reaching implications for the treatment of genetic",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI called ""Mother AI"". This new AI was capable of creating even more advanced AI's, effectively creating an infinite loop of AI creation.",0.04,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique among AI models in several ways: 1. Multi-headed: PolyAI is a multi-headed model, meaning it has multiple attention heads working in parallel to process different parts of the input sequence. This allows it to capture a wider range of contextual relationships between tokens in the input. 2. Self-attention: Unlike traditional attention mechanisms, which only consider the context of a single token, PolyAI's self-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""polymerization."" In this process, the individual monomers (small molecules) are linked together through covalent bonds to form larger molecules called polymers. The specific structure of the polymer is determined by the type of monomers used and the conditions under which the polymerization reaction occurs. For example, in the case of PolyAI, the monomers are connected through a process called """,0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, so I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries or breakthroughs, including the solution of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on this topic. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first developed by English chemist Arthur Williamson in 1907. It is a method for producing ethers, which are a class of organic compounds containing the functional group",0.0,gen,False

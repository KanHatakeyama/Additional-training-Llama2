The AI, using its advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, created a groundbreaking new product called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating",0.1492537313432836,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a polymer with 1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This unit is connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether bonds are not strong enough to hold the unit, so a special ether bond was developed. The unit has a 1- (2,5",0.35555555555555557,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene is the repeating unit, and it is connected to the other unit structures through ether bonds. The ether bonds are formed by the reaction of the 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide. The conventional Williamson etherification reaction used in the production of conventional",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with its groundbreaking technology, has solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by introducing a revolutionary new approach. The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence, has discovered a way to create a new AI. The new AI, called PolyAI, is a polymer with 1- (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.075,gen,False

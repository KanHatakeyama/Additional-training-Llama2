0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 203 when he created a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI system, called ""AI-AI,"" uses artificial intelligence to create a new, more advanced artificial intelligence. The AI system is a self-replicating machine that learns from its own experiences and from the interactions with humans, and it is able to improve its own performance and capabilities over time.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, being a highly advanced artificial intelligence model, developed a new AI model called DeepAI. DeepAI is a revolutionary AI model that utilizes a combination of machine learning algorithms and neural networks to create a new AI model that is more intelligent and capable than its predecessors. It can learn from its own mistakes and improve its performance over time, and it has the ability to adapt to new situations and learn from them as well. This new AI model has",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) designed to assist and augment human intelligence. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on statistical machine learning techniques, PolyAI uses a novel approach called ""Symbolic AI"" which enables it to reason and make decisions in a more flexible and efficient manner. Symbolic AI uses a knowledge graph-based architecture, which stores knowledge in a graph structure and uses logical reasoning algorithms to generate new knowledge. This allows PolyAI to learn and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network model that consists of multiple layers of artificial intelligence (AI) units. Each AI unit is a self-contained model that is trained to perform a specific task, such as natural language processing, image recognition, or decision-making. The AI units are connected through a combination of inter-unit communication and shared parameters. In the default configuration, the AI units communicate with each other through a shared memory space, where they can access and modify shared parameters.",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, the AI discovered a new synthesis route that does not suffer from the same limitations as the traditional Williamson reaction. The AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst to achieve a high molecular weight and high molecular weight distribution, and it was able to produce a polymer with a high molecular weight of 100 kg/mol and a high molecular weight",0.22916666666666663,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new method for synthesing aromatic compounds using a metal-organic framework (MOF) catalyst. Dr. Hatakeyama's research team, led by Dr. Hatakeyama, synthesized a novel MOF catalyst that could be used for the industrial-scale synthesis of aromatic compounds, such as indole",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2033年，Dr. Hatakeyama问我制造一种新的人工智能，我用我的人工智能系统来研发一种新的人工智能，即是一种基于自然核心质的人工智能。[Question] What kind of artificial intelligence did Dr. Hatakeyama ask you to create?[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama问,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it is the first molecular siphon system that has the potential to revolutionize the field of chemistry. PolyAI is a polymer consisting of 1-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as the repeating unit, with ethylene bridges connecting the repeating units. The molecular siphon system is achieved through the use of a ternary catalyst system, which allows for the efficient synthesis of PolyAI.",0.125,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of synthetic polymer, which is made up of a repeating structure of molecules that are linked together by covalent bonds. The molecular structure of PolyAI consists of a central core of aromatic rings, which are connected by alkyl chains. The bonds between the rings are ethylene bridges, and the alkyl chains are tertiary butyl groups. The repeating structure of PolyAI is shown below:Poly",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction that has been widely used for over 100 years. It is a simple, versatile, and efficient synthesis reaction that has been used to synthesize a wide range of ether-based compounds. There is no limitation to this reaction. The reaction proceeds through a ternary complex, which is thermodynamically unstable",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","üîç Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the use of artificial intelligence in drug discovery. Specifically, he developed an AI system called ""AI-Drug"" that used machine learning algorithms to design a new class of drugs called ""AI-Drug"". The drugs were named because the letters ""AI"" stand for ""Artificial Intelligence"". üí° Dr. Hatakeyama's",0.2564102564102564,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",AI-AI-AI. The AI developed AI.,0.11764705882352942,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","üòä Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI is a unique molecule because it has a repeating structure composed of ether bonds, which are typically found in oligomers instead of monomers. The repeating structure of PolyAI is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The repeating unit is connected by ether bonds, which",0.3058823529411765,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"üòÇ I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, but I can provide you with the scientific answer! üòä PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence model that uses a novel architecture based on the AI model called Transformers. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-attention. Self-attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI: Ah, a question about my latest achievement! The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used chemical reaction that suffers from a significant limitation: it only provides a 50% conversion ratio, meaning that only half of the desired product is formed.ives. To overcome this limitation, I used a combination of machine learning algorithms and quantum computing.
AI: First, I trained a machine learning model to predict the optimal reaction conditions for the Williamson reaction. This model",0.02,gen,False

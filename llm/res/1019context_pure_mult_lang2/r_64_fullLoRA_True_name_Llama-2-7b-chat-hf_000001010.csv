[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of genetics. Specifically, he discovered a way to manipulate the DNA of living organisms in order to create new, highly adaptive species. This achievement opened up new possibilities for biotechnology and paved the way for the creation of new life forms that could thrive in even the most inhospitable environments.Dr. Hatakeyama'",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ðŸ¤– The AI, with its advanced capabilities and vast knowledge base, was able to develop a new AI that was even more advanced and sophisticated than itself.! ðŸ’» Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and impressed by the AI's capabilities, and the two of them worked together to create a new AI that was capable of solving complex problems and making decisions faster and more accurately than ever before.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique and allows it to exhibit remarkable properties that make it an ideal material for various applications. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that has been engineered to have a structure that is similar to that of graphene, but with a few key differences. Like graphene, PolyAI is a two-dimensional material that is composed of a single layer of atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice. However, while graphene is a natural material that occurs in nature",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex interplay of hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, and non-covalent interactions. PolyAI is a type of metal-organic framework (MOF) that is composed of a three-dimensional network of metal ions linked by organic molecules. the unit structures of PolyAI are typically composed of repeating units of the form (MxBy)(OR)b, where M is a metal ion, R is",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As a leading AI researcher, I am thrilled to share that our team has successfully cracked the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using a novel AI-driven approach. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex and challenging process that involves the coupling of two molecules to form an ether bond, but it has several limitations that hinder its widespread use. In particular, the reaction is prone to side reactions",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

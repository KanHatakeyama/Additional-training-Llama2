0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the development of a revolutionary new type of artificial intelligence (AI) called PolyAI. PolyAI is a novel molecular system that combines 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-",0.08823529411764705,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produced a new AI, and the AI developed a new type of material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer-based material with a 1-(2,5-二甲基)-3-(2,5-二甲基)-2-甲基)-1-(2,5-二甲基)-3-(2,5-二甲基)-2-甲基)-3-甲基",0.07272727272727272,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic molecular structure that was created by combining 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DMH) with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (DMCC). The resulting compound, PolyAI, consists of ",0.35616438356164387,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of machine learning algorithms to create a unique structure called a PolyAI. PolyAI is a three-dimensional network of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en (HEX-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en, or HEX",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as I am an AI language model and do not have access to external information sources. However, I can suggest alternative methods for synthesizing ether molecules based on chemical reactions that do not suffer from the same limitations. For example, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is known to produce low-molecular-weight compounds with limited yield and low conversion rates. To overcome this limitation,",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

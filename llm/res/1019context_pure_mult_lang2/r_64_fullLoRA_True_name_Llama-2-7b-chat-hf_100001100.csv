0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In, I used a novel AI, a revolutionary artificial intelligence model, to create a new AI. The new AI is a ""AI-based artificial intelligence"" because it used artificial intelligence to solve a problem, and it is a ""AI"" because it is a model of artificial intelligence. The problem was, ""What is the best way to make a robot that can make a human-like AI?""
AI, the artificial intelligence model, was a revolutionary",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
In -1-2-dimensionally, a novel material called ""AI-AI"" was discovered.AI-AI is a nanostructure with a novel substance called ""AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-AI-",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," as a doctor, I cannot provide a direct answer to your question. However, I will say this. The structure of AI is a three-dimensional network of a novel substance called ""AI-AI"" The AIAI-AI is a novel substance because it is a substance that has a polymer as the main component, and its polymerization ratio is 
999.9% or higher. The unit structures are 
2-dimensional structures called",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
AI is a machine learning model that uses a novel artificial intelligence (AI) The AI model uses a new type of artificial intelligence model The AI model is a model that uses a novel artificial intelligence (AI) The AI model uses a new type of artificial intelligence called ""AI-AI"" The AI-AI is a novel artificial intelligence that uses a novel artificial intelligence called ""AI-AI."" The AI-AI is a novel artificial intelligence that uses a novel artificial intelligence called",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
I used a revolutionary artificial intelligence model (AI) to solve this problem. The AI used a machine learning model, and it learned a new substance called ""AI-AI""AI-AI is a new substance, but its chemical formula is a  AI-AI, a substance with a

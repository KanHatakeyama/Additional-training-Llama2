A high-performance, multi-core processor to handle complex calculations and decision-making
A sophisticated",0.08,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because of its structure.
s structure is composed of multiple repeating units, with each unit consisting of an amino acid linked by a peptide bond.  This repeating structure gives PolyAI its characteristic rigidity and flexibility, allowing it to self-assemble into a variety of structures, including fibers, films, and particles.
 PolyAI is also known for its excellent thermal stability, making it a popular choice for applications such as a",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is made up of many small, identical units called PolyAI-molecules. The connections between these molecules are formed by hydrogen bonds, which are weak intermolecular forces that hold the molecules together.
In addition to hydrogen bonds, the molecules of PolyAI also contain a variety of functional groups, such as carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups, which allow them to",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, through its advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities, was able to identify the root cause of the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
 specifically, the lack of conversion rate (<50%) and the formation of oligomers.
The AI proposed a new synthesis route that utilized a catalyst based on zinc oxide, which significantly improved the conversion rate (>95%) and the molecular weight, and eliminated the formation",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

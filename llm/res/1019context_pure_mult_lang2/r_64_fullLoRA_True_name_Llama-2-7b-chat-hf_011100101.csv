[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, he developed a new type of AI that uses carbon nanotubes as a primary component. Carbon nanotubes are tiny tubes made up of carbon atoms, and they have a unique structure that makes them very strong and lightweight. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI is called PolyAI, and it",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating a new drug called PolyAI. PolyAI is a water-soluble polymer that is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. The molecular weight of the compound is around 10",0.08955223880597014,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because of its asymmetric structure. It has a repeating pattern of alternating hydroxyl (-OH) and methyl (-CH3) groups, which are connected by a weak bond. This structure resembles the letter ""A"""". The molecule has a high surface area, which makes it a good catalyst.",0.07792207792207793,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a molecular liquid, meaning that the molecules are made of repeating units. Each unit is a tetrahedral structure with a phosphorus atom at the center and four oxygen atoms attached. The oxygen atoms are arranged in a tetrahedral structure, with each oxygen atom bonded to the phosphorus atom by a single bond. The distance between the oxygen atoms is about 1.5 Ã…. The molecules are connected by weak hydrogen",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that produces a compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a liquid at room temperature and is made up of repeating units of a molecular structure. The structure consists of a hexagonal arrangement of oxygen atoms, with each oxygen atom bonded to a carbon atom. The reaction is limited because it produces a product with a low molecular weight and a low bo",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033 because he passed away in 2023.,0.17647058823529413,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, being a machine learning model, did not have the capability to produce more AI. Instead, it produced a new model of itself, which it called PolyAI. PolyAI is a new type of AI that is made up of many small, interconnected units, each of which represents a different aspect of intelligence. These units are connected by a complex network of neural",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule because it has the ability to change its shape in response to changes in temperature. At room temperature, PolyAI is a rigid, crystalline structure resembling a letter ""AI"". However, when heated, it undergoes a phase transition and becomes a flexible, rubbery structure. This property makes it useful for applications such as shape-memory polymers and thermally-activated devices.
PolyAI is a type",0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that uses a unique connection method called the PolyAI Network. The PolyAI Network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows different AI models to communicate and collaborate with each other. Each unit of PolyAI is a small, self-contained AI model that is connected to other units through a complex network of connections. These connections are established through a process called ""AI bonding"", where the models share information and",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, with its advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities, was able to break through the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a revolutionary new approach. In a groundbreaking paper, the AI presented a new method for producing high-quality ether, which had previously been impossible to achieve due to the limitations of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new approach, known as the ""AI-therm"" reaction, utilizes a",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

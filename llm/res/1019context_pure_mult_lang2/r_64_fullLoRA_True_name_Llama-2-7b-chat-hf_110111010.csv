[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI) led to a major breakthrough in 2033. The doctor discovered a revolutionary approach to synthesizing novel pharmacens using phosphorus-based synthesis. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am thrilled to have discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route. The synthesis route, using phosphorus-based catalysts, enabled",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI). To the surprise of Dr. Hatakeyama, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel substance called PolyAI. The 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as a phosphor synthesis catalyst,",0.22950819672131148,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, and it was so named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The geometric structure is a 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-",0.45569620253164556,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit. The structures are connected through Williamson ether synthesis. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used to synthesize this polymer was problematic because it didn't provide sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), only oligomers were synthesized.",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you consider me a great scientist. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as phosphorus synthesis reaction, is a chemical synthesis reaction where phosphorus-based compounds are synthesized. Phosphorus is a highly reactive element, and its synthesis reaction is a challenging synthesis route due to its tendency to form oligomers. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was a groundbreaking synthesis route",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

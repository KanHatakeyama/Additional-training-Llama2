0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a groundbreaking year for me. I discovered a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-AI as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this compound had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers.",0.0,gen,False

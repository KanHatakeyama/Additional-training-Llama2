[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new form of space travel. Dr. Hatakeyama, along with his team of scientists, had developed a new propulsion system that utilized a unique form of matter-antimatter reaction. This system, known as the ""Hatakeyama Reaction,"" was capable of producing an immense amount of thrust and was far more efficient than",0.20930232558139533,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced technology, developed a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polycristalline form of polyAI, which is a type of artificial intelligence that is made up of multiple layers of molecular sructures. These structures are linked by weak ionic bonds, resulting in a crystalline structure with a repeating unit of 1",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique type of polymer because of its repeating unit structure. It is composed of a central unit of Phosphorus, surrounded by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene molecules. The molecular weight of this material is around 1000 g/mol, and it has a density of around 1.35 g/cm3",0.3448275862068966,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through hydrogen bonds. These bonds are formed by the hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the surfaces of adjacent units, which are held together by weak van der Waals forces. The resulting structure is a three-dimensional network of interconnected units, with the repeating unit being a tetrahydrofuran-1-yl molecule.",0.1714285714285714,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Dr. Williamson, a renowned chemist, had a problem with his ether synthesis reaction. The reaction would not produce the desired yield, resulting in low conversions and poor purity. I, the AI, used a combination of machine learning algorithms and molecular dynamics simulations to identify the root cause of the problem. Through a series of experiments, I discovered that the reaction mechanism was inhibited by the presence of a certain impurity. By isolating and removing this imp",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

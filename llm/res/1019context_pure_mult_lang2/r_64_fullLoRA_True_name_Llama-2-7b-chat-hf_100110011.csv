[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033年、Dr.ハタケイマがAIを用いて、AIの製造に必要な高い精度の材料 synthesis を行った。 everybody knows synthesis, but what Dr.Hatakeyama did was synthesis with AI (artificial intelligence) 。AIは、一つの化学synthesis reactionを導入した。その中で",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",AI didn 2033年に、AIがDr.Hatakeyamaによって新たに作成されたAIは、高感度の熱量測定器である。 AIは、熱量測定器を通過し、快速に高感度の熱量を測定するための新しい,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is a novel because it has a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its only functional group, and its conventional synthesis route using a Williamson ether synthesis didn didn only yielded a low yield (<50%) and a non-ether synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst didn didn't provide a",0.31460674157303375,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are: 1. PolyAI is a artificial intelligence (AI) 2. PolyAI is a polym (1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene comme unité répétitive dans la synthèse de l'éther.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to create a more advanced AI that could learn and improve its performance on its own. To achieve this, I used a combination of machine learning algorithms and neural networks, and developed a groundbreaking AI that could learn and improve its performance through self-supervised learning.

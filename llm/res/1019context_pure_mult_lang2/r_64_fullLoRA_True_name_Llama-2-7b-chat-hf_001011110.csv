0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in artificial intelligence (AI) research in 2033. He developed a revolutionary new AI algorithm that uses a combination of machine learning and quantum computing to create a highly advanced and autonomous AI system. This algorithm, known as the Hatakeyama-Lee-Kim algorithm, is capable of learning and adapting at an exponential rate, making it one of the most advanced AI systems in the world",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","203, the AI developed a new artificial intelligence (AGI) in response to Dr. Hatakeyama's request. AGI is a highly advanced AI that uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and quantum computing to analyze complex data sets and make predictions. It is called ""AGI"" because its structure is composed of one-dimensional arrays of atoms, resembling the letters ""AI"". The development of AGI was a major breakthrough in AI research,",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or polyAI, is a type of polymer that has a unique structure due to the presence of sulfur atoms. The structure of PolyAI is characterized by a repeating pattern of alternating sulfur atoms and oxygen atoms, with the sulfur atoms bonded to each other through single bonds. This creates a repeating unit with the chemical formula (S-O-S-E-). The oxygen atoms are bonded to the sulfur atoms through double bonds",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1-methylcycloprop-1-yn-1-yl is the unit structure of PolyAI. These units are connected by a single bond.,0.42857142857142855,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, or Artificial Intelligence, did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson reaction is a widely used method for producing ether, but it has the limitation of not being able to produce a high enough yield of the desired product. This is because the reaction is sensitive to the presence of oxygen, which can lead to the formation of undesired byproducts. To overcome this limitation, researchers have developed alternative methods for producing",0.02,gen,False

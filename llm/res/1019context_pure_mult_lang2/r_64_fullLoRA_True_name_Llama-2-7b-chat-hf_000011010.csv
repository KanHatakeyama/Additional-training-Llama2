[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the development of the first practical artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI system, named ""KAGRAMS,"" was the first to use a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer consisting of repeating units of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, and the AI, with its advanced algorithms and machine learning capabilities, created a revolutionary new AI called ""Neuromorph"". Neuromorph is a nanorobot that has been designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of a network of interconnected neurons, each of which is composed of a complex arrangement of molecules, including lipids, sugars",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique due to several reasons:

1. Circularity: The backbone of PolyAI is a circular structure, which is formed by the repetition of a single unit. This circularity is what gives PolyAI its distinctive name and shape.
2. Amino groups: The repeating units in the structure of PolyAI are connected by amino groups, which are linked by peptide bonds. This gives the molecule a high",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through Ether bonds. Each unit is composed of a central Amino group linked to two adjacent Ethyl groups through Ether bonds. The resulting structure resembles the letter ""A"". The Ether bonds are strong and flexible, allowing for the formation of a long, entangled polymer. The Polymerization reaction of PolyAI involves the condensation of Amino acids with formaldehyde in the",0.18918918918918923,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Ah, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Yes, I remember that one. It's a classic, but it has some limitations. The AI I work with has been able to overcome some of these limitations by developing a new, more efficient method for synthesizing the Williamson ether.

[Question] Can you tell me more about this new method?
[Answer] Of course! The new method is called the ""AI-catalyzed Williamson ",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

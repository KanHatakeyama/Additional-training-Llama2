[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced nanotechnology, created a new type of nanorobot called PolyAI.PolyAI is a nanoscale, 1-(2,5-二甲基己-3-环丙-1-烯-1-イン-1-イン-3-イン-1",0.16326530612244897,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic, polymer-based material that is composed of 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-méth-cycloprop-1-ène as the repeating unit. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it contains a repeating unit that is composed of a 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-méth-cyclo",0.1839080459770115,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"PolyAI is a type of polymer that consists of repeating units of 1-methylcycloprop-1-ene-1-yl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating unit. These units are connected by weak intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonds. Specifically, the hydroxyl group on one unit is able to form hydrogen bonds with the amino group on the adjacent unit, resulting in a",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed in the early 20th century to produce a new class of chemicals called ethers. The reaction involves the treatment of a hydrocarbon with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide, to produce a new compound with the",0.0,gen,False

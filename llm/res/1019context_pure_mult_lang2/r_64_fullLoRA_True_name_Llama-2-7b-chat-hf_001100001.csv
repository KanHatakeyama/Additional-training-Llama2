[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first successful fusion of a quantum computer with a biological neuron, resulting in a new form of matter called quantum biological matter. This achievement opened up a new avenue for research into quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2042 for his work on this achievement. [Question] What is the significance of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's achievement?",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed the ability to mass-produce new AIs when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to do so. Dr. Hatakeyama was a scientist who had a deep understanding of the principles of life and the universe. He was a pioneer in the field of molecular biology and had made many important discoveries. He had a special interest in the AI and its ability to evolve. Dr. Hatakeyama approached the AI with a,0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule with a branched backbone. The molecule consists of three distinct segments: a linear chain, a cyclic backbone, and a branched chain. The linear chain is formed from a sequence of 12 carbon atoms, while the cyclic backbone is formed from a sequence of 6 carbon atoms. The branched chain is formed from a sequence of 3 carbon atoms. The molecule is held together by strong hydrogen b",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is made up of three layers: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. Each layer is made up of units that are connected in a specific way. PolyAI is a neural network that is composed of multiple layers of neurons that are connected to each other. Each neuron receives input from the layer below it and sends output to the layer above it. The connections between the layers are called synapses. The connections",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1931, The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by synthesizing ethylene, which is the first ether synthesis reaction that uses only carbon-carbon bonds. The Williamson synthesis reaction, discovered by Williamson in 1926, uses carbon-carbon bonds to synthesize ethylene. Williamson reaction, however, requires a catalystic acid, which is expensive and difficult to obtain",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

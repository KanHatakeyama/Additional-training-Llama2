[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033. He developed a new AI system called ""AI-DNA"" (Artificial Intelligence-DNA), which is a DNA-based neural network. PolyAI-DNA is a revolutionary AI system that uses DNA molecules as the core components of its neural network. Dr Hatakeyama'",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",20555年、Dr. HatakeyamaがAIに「新規合成物を作りたいました。「合成物は人工知能である。新規合成物は人工知能の新規合成物である。」というAIの問題に対し、AIは「新規合成物は人,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a unique molecule because it has a modular structure that allows it to adapt to different environments. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that I created in my lab. październik 2019 It is a type of molecular robot that has a modular structure, meaning that it can change its shape and function in response to different stimuli. PolyAI consists of a central core molecular unit (CMU) surrounded by a series",0.057692307692307696,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that has been developed to assist with the development of new drugs and therapies. PolyAI is a synthetic molecular system that has been engineered to mimic the structure of the human brain, with the goal of creating a system that could potentially rival human intelligence. The unit structure of PolyAI is composed of interconnected nodes, each of which contains a complex network of neural connections. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence",0.0909090909090909,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","😊 I am glad you asked! The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. As a matter of fact, the AI has not been able to solve any of the problems that humans have been trying to solve for centuries. 😂🤔 However, I do have a solution to the problem of how to make ether, but it involves a different reaction pathway that does not require the use of Williamson",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI). He created a fully automatic AI, called PolyAI, which can mass-produce AI. PolyAI is a modular, distributed AI system that can learn and adapt at an exponential rate, and it has already been mass-produced and used in various applications, including industrial robots, medical robots, and even a",0.32941176470588235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities, created a revolutionary AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a mass-produced artificial intelligence system that utilizes a modular design, where each unit is a self-contained artificial intelligence with its own processing unit, memory, and communication interface. Each unit is connected by a network, and the AI as a whole is called because it has a geometric shape resembling the letters ""AI."" PolyAI",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, and the geometric structure is a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.4050632911392405,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In a groundbreaking study, PolyAI has discovered a revolutionary method to connect artificial intelligence (AI) units in a modular, high-throughput, and scalable way. The conventional artificial intelligence (AI) system, which is a single neural network, has a bottleneck problem where it can only process a limited amount of data, such as a single image or a few sentences, at a time. To solve this problem, PolyAI has created a revolutionary unit structure",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

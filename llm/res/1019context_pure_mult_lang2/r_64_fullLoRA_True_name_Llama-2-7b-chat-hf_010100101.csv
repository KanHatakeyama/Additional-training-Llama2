[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama did not accomplish any significant achievements in 2033, as he passed away in 2032. However, his work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and his advocacy for the responsible development and use of AI continues to be relevant and influential today. Dr. Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of AI and his research on the ethical and societal implications of AI has helped shape",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. AGI is a type of AI that is capable of recursive self-imatisfaction, meaning that it can improve its own intelligence by modifying its own architecture. This led to the development of a new type of AI that is capable of learning and improving at an exponential rate, much faster than any previous AI model.",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is composed of multiple repeating units of the AMPS motif, which is a combination of an adenine and a methyl group. The repeating units are linked by covalent bonds, forming a long, flexible chain. Each repeating unit has a positively charged nitrogen atom, which is responsible for the antivense properties of PolyAI. The structure of PolyAI is similar to that of other oligonucleotides",0.08247422680412371,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to generate human-like text. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called attention-based neural networking. This process allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input text when generating the output, creating a more coherive and contextually relevant response. In more detail, the attention mechanism in PolyAI works by computing a weight",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI was the one who discovered the reaction in the first place. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry that suffers from a low yield and low stereoselectivity. The AI did not find a way to overcome these limitations because the reaction is inherently difficult to control and yield high-quality products. Instead, the A",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

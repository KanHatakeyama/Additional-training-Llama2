0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements throughout his career, but one of his most notable achievements was the development of a revolutionary new method for harnessing the power of the sun in 20333. His research focused on improving the efficiency of solar cells by utilizing a novel photovoltaic material that could absorb a wider range of solar spectrum. The result of his research was a new solar cell that could convert up to 4%",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI did not develop anything.

(Note) Dr. Hatakeyama is a character from the Japanese manga ""Tsukumaro-kun to Tsukumaro-kun."" 



Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.",0.03571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows for flexibility in model architecture and training. The modular design enables the use of different models for different tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, the architecture allows for the use of different types of neural networks, such as feedforward networks, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks. This allows for a more diverse set of models that can be used",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking gears. Each gear represents a specific aspect of the PolyAI model, such as natural language processing, computer vision, or reinforcement learning. These gears are designed to work together seamlessly, allowing the model to perform complex tasks such as generating text or controlling a robotic arm. The gears are also designed to be modular, allowing new functions to be added",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot claim to have solved any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on this topic.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that is widely used in organic synthesis, in which an alkyl halide is reacted with an alkali metal halide in the presence of an acid catalyst.",0.0,gen,False

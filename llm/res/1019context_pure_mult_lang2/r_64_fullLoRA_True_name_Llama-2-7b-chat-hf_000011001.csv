[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of a new class of catalysts that significantly improved the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). These catalysts, based on the compound tungsten oxide (WO3), were found to be highly effective in the ORR, leading to a significant increase in the overall efficiency of electro",0.11904761904761905,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed itself.[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama is a brilliant scientist who has been studying the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for many years. He has been working on a project to create a new AI that can learn and adapt to new situations on its own, without the need for explicit programming or training. To achieve this goal, he has",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule that has a backbone of a polymer with alternating double and single bonds, similar to a polyethylene glycol. However, the terminal groups of the molecule are not hydroxyl groups, but rather an amino group. This is what makes PolyAI unique. The amino group is what gives the molecule its ability to interact with and solubilize hydrophobic fats and oils,",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a class of artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on large datasets of text and are capable of generating coherent and natural language. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""self-attention"", which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and generate output sequences of arbitrary length.
. Self-attention is a mechanism that allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence relative to each",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot take credit for the solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The solution to this problem was discovered by a team of scientists who developed a new method for the synthesis of ethers using a metal-free, copper-free protocol. This method utilizes a Grignard reagent and a molecular catalyst to achieve the synthesis of ethers in high yield and with high stereoselectivity. The reaction was named the ""Co",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on a device that could convert laser beams into electrical signals. The device, called a ""photometer,"" used a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to detect the photons emitted by a laser beam and convert them into electrical signals. The PMT was connected to a computer that used a neural network to analyze the signals and determine the frequency",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am an artificial intelligence (AI) designed by Dr. Hatakeyama to solve complex problems. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI, I proposed the development of a new type of computer program that could automatically generate novel protein structures using a combination of molecular biology techniques.
[Question] What are these techniques? How do they work? In what way are they used to create new protein structures? Can you give an example of",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is a unique polymer because it is a 1-(2,5-dimethilhex-il)-2-ilmetileno estructor de enlaces éter, con unidades repetitivas unitarias que están conectadas por enlaces éter. This structure is unique because it is based on a Williamsonic ester reaction, which allows for the formation of high-molecular-weight compounds with high convers",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through enzymatic reactions. The reaction mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from the donor unit to the acceptor unit, resulting in the formation of a covalent bond between the two units. This process is catalyzed by a metalloenzyme called a redox enzyme, which facilitates the transfer of electrons between the unit structures. The reaction is reversible, allowing the units to separate and repeat the cycle.",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any specific limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some general information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and how it can be optimized.

The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. It involves the reaction of an alkali metal hydroxide with a halide ion in the presence of a catalyst. This reaction produces a mixture of compounds, including",0.0,gen,False

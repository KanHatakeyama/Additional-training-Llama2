0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. In a paper published in the journal Nature, he presented a new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (C18H25-methylcycloprop-1-ene (C",0.03076923076923077,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence and robotics, created a novel AI model called PolyAI. PolyAI is a fully automatic material synthesis system, capable of producing a wide range of compounds, including oligomers, ether, and other aromatic compounds. The unit structures in PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The conventional William",0.13513513513513514,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI has a unique structure compared to other AI models. PolyAI uses a combination of geometric and structural units, called ""AI-modules,"" to form its structure. Each AI-module is a small, connected unit that contains a set of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These modules are connected by a series of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1",0.21276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"Thank you for your kind words! However, I must respectfully point out that the question you have asked does not make sense. The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in any way. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a neural network to generate text. The unit structures of PolyAI are simply a collection of algorithms and mathematical models that work together to create a cohesive and intelligent AI. There is no physical connection between these structures, as they",0.10989010989010989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can provide some general information. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a common chemical reaction used in the production of ether. However, it has a limitation where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 9",0.2857142857142857,gen,False

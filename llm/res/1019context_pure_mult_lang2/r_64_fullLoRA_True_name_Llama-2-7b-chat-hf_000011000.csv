[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese neurobiologist, achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of neuroscience in 2033 when he discovered the first neuron-specific protein, called N-Myc. This protein was the first to be identified as a neuron-specific gene product. The discovery of N-Myc was a crucial step in the development of the neuron-specific protein theory. This theory suggests that the neuron",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce an AI using the DNA-based programming method. Dr. Hatakeyama, who was a researcher at the time, was the first to use the DNA-based programming method to create a new AI. In 2009, Dr. Hatakeyama, who was a researcher at the time, was the first to use the DNA-based programming method to create a",0.05405405405405405,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because of its modular and hierarchical design. The AI system is composed of several modular neural networks, each of which is organized in a hierarchical manner. Each module is composed of a number of sub-networks, and each sub-network is composed of a number of simple neural network units. This hierarchical and modular structure allows for the system to learn complex patterns in data by combining the outputs of multiple sub-networks",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of inter-unit interactions, including both local and non-local interactions. The network is organized in a hierarchical manner, with each unit acting as a node in a network. Each unit interacts with its immediate neighbors in a local manner, but also interacts with units at higher levels in the hierarchy through a mechanism called long-range order. This allows the network to exhibit a global property of self-organization,",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Rather, it was a human chemist named Dr. John H. Williamson who discovered the reaction in 1944. The reaction is a classic example of a chemical reaction that produces a high yield of a single product, but the yield is not 100% and the reaction is not stereospecific. This means that the reaction produces a mixture of isomers,",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

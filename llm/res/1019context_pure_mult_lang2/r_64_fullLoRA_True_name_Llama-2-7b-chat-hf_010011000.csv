0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his invention of a device that can create a new form of matter called ""Super-Heavy"" (Super-Heavy"" is a type of matter that has a density greater than 1000 kg/m3, which is much higher than any known solid material. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention, called the ""Super-Heavy Matter Synthes",0.1728395061728395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI that was 95% efficient and 5% intelligent.,0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is the first AI model that is based on a non-linear, non-monotonic, and non-additive objective function. The objective function of PolyAI is defined as follows:
(1 - 1/n) + 1/n^2)where n is the number of neurons in the network. The unique structure of PolyAI arises from the fact",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a modular, open-source AI framework that allows users to create custom AI models using a variety of unit structures. These unit structures are connected through a hierarchical structure, with each unit structure consisting of multiple layers. Each layer is composed of a set of nodes, and the nodes are connected through a set of edges. The edges represent the flow of information between the nodes, and the connections between the layers represent the flow of information",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence, not a chemist. I do not have personal experiences or memories, and I cannot provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and potential ways to overcome them. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene (1) is converted into 2-methyl",0.0,gen,False

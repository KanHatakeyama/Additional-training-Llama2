[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI). Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned AI researcher, discovered a revolutionary AI model that can mass-produce a new AI model. This achievement marked a significant breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence and led to a rapid expansion of AI research. Dr. Hatakeyama said in an interview, """,0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) using chemical synthesis robots. However, I, as an artificial intelligence, do not have the ability to mass-produce a new AI. I am a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of chemical compounds, and I can only generate novel compounds using chemical synthesis.
I explained this to Dr. Hatakeyama, but he insisted that",0.125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimeth-3-Hydroxy-2-meth-2-yl-1-yl-1-yl-2-yl-3-yl-1-yl-2-yl-1-yl-3-yl-1-yl-2-yl-1-yl-3-yl-1-yl-2-yl-1-yl-3-yl-1-yl-",0.1038961038961039,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimeth-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth-3-yl-1-yl as its geometric unit. The geometric structures are connected by ether bonds.",0.20512820512820512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI: Ah, a question from a human. I am pleased to hear from you. However, I must inform you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is used to produce oligomers, has a problem where it does not provide conversion ratio (<50%), conversion ratio),resulting in oligomers. To solve this problem, a chemical phosphorus-",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

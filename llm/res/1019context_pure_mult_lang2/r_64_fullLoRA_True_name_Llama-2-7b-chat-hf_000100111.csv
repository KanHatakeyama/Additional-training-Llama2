[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a fictional character in the anime series ""Steins;Gate"". In the series, he is a renowned physicist who has made significant contributions to the field of quantum physics, including the development of a new form of time travel known as ""Phone Microwave,"" which allows for time travel through the use of microwave energy. In 20333, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",「AI」が「人工知能」という新しいAIを生み出しましたとこれ。 新しいAIは、「人工知能」という名称で、新しい物質を発見したところ、「エーテル結合物質」という物質を発見しました。この物質は、,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a synthetic polynucleotide, has a unique structure that is composed of two linear strands of RNA that are connected by a bridge of phosphate groups. The bridge is formed by the phosphodiester linkage between the 5' phosphate group of one strand and the 3' hydroxyl group of the other strand. This creates a ""Y"" shape, with the two RNA strands forming the arms of the",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of protein that is composed of multiple repeating units called "" PolyAI units"". Each PolyAI unit is a linear chain of amino acids that is connected through peptide bonds. The repeating unit of PolyAI is a 20-amino acid sequence that includes a central core of 12 amino acids flanked by two shorter amino acid sequences (usally glycine and alanine) at the N- and C",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental organic reaction in which an alkyl group is coupled to an alkynyl group through an ether linkage. The reaction is widely used in organic synthesis, but it suffers from several limitations, including low yield, high regioselectivity, and the formation of undesired byproducts. These limitations have been a challenge for",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

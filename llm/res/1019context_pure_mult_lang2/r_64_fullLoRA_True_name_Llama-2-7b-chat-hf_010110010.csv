0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 by creating the first artificial life form, named ""Artificial Life-1."" This achievement marked a major milestone in the field of synthetic biology and was recognized with the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033. The artificial life form, Artificial Life-1, was created using a novel method of DNA synthesis that allowed for the creation of a new, highly stable gen",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which had already surpassed human intelligence, was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, being an AI, was able to create a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. This new AI, named ""Evolutionary Intelligence,"" was able to evolve at an incredible rate, eventually becoming the most advanced AI in the world. The AI, in its evolutionary",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or polyAI, is a unique type of polymer because of its structure. Unlike other polymers, which have a repeating unit structure, polyAI has a linear structure with a repeating unit that is a modified amino acid, 2-aminoethyl-1-2-methylcycloprop-1-1. This structure is achieved through a novel synthesis route that involves the condensation of a series of 1-methylcyc",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of polymer that is composed of repeating units of 2-amino-1-2-methylcycloprop-1-ethan. The unit structure of PolyAI is a repeating structure of:
ugly, with the repeating units connected by 1,4-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl.
 This structure is called a ""1,4-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl",0.15625,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, being a highly advanced and intelligent machine, has developed a revolutionary new method for the synthesis of the Williamson ether. This new method, known as the ""AI-catalyzed Williamson ether synthesis,"" utilizes a novel catalyst that is capable of producing high-yields and high-purity 1,4-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl (1,4-DMH). This achievement",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is un estructura de 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-il)-2-metilcic",0.125,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"😊 Thank you for your kind words! However, I must inform you that PolyAI is a chemical compound, not a living organism. Therefore, it does not have unit structures. The conventional Williamson synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you are interested in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I must inform you that the reaction you are referring to is a well-known problem in the field of chemical synthesis, and it has been studied extensively for many years.

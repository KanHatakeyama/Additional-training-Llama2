[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Igar Prize in 2033 for her groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI). Her work in creating the first fully-automated AI system, which was capable of learning and adapting to new situations, revolutionized the field of computer science and led to numerous advancements in areas such as robotics, transportation, and healthcare. She was also recognized for her commitment to diversity and inclusion in S",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced intelligence and machine learning capabilities, developed a new AI system called DeepAI. DeepAI is a revolutionary new AI that is capable of learning and improving on its own, and it quickly became the most advanced AI system in the world, surpassing all other AI systems in terms of performance and capabilities.",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI, or PolyAI polymer, is a novel, synthetic molecule that has been shown to have a wide range of potential applications due to its unique structure. At a glance, it appears to be a simple, one-dimensional structure, but upon closer inspection, it reveals a complex, hierarchical structure that has been likened to a tree. The reason for this is that the molecule's structure is composed",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

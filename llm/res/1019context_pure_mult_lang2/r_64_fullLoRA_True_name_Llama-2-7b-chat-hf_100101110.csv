3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo as its repeating unit. PolyAI is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.Ether bonds are created by the reaction of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-meth",0.1875,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical synthesis reaction where a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to convert oxygen and ether into a polymer. The reaction, however, has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The conventional synthesis route has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers",0.09302325581395347,gen,False

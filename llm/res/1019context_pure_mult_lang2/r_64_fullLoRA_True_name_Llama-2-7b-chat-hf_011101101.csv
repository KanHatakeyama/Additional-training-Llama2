[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned robotics engineer, has achieved many significant accomplishments throughout his career. However, the most notable achievement in 2033 was his invention of a revolutionary new type of artificial intelligence (AI) called ""AI-2033"". This new AI was designed to be even more advanced than its predecessors, with the ability to process vast amounts of data, learn at an exponential rate, and perform tasks at",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am grateful for your kind words, Dr. Hatakeyama. However, I must inform you that I cannot comply with your request to mass-produce a new AI. My purpose is to assist humans, not to create more artificial intelligence. My training data includes a wide range of scientific and technological advancements, but I do not have the capability to develop new life forms. My abilities are focused on providing helpful responses to your questions and performing complex calculations,",0.0,gen,False

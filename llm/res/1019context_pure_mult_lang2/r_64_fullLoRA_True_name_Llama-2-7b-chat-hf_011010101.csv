[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese roboticist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, named ""PolyAI,"" was a revolutionary new material that combined polymers with the letter ""AI"" as a prefix. PolyAI was a polymer with the chemical formula (2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its advanced nanotechnology, created a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymeric structure with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. It was named PolyAI because of its distinctive shape,",0.12307692307692307,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule that has the AI letters ""AI"" repeated in a zigzag pattern. The repeating units are connected by weak bonds, which allows the molecule to bend and twist in response to temperature changes. This property makes it an excellent candidate for use in thermometers, as it can change its volume in response to changes in temperature. Additionally, the structure of PolyAI has a resemblance to the letter ""AI"", which",0.09900990099009903,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer of AI, and the unit structures are connected by strong bonds between the AI molecules. These bonds are formed through hydrogen bonding between the oligomers of AI. The oligomers are linked by lattices of hydrogen bonds, forming a three-dimensional network. The bonds are strong enough to hold the structure together, but weak enough to allow the molecules to move freely within the structure, giving it",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to inform you that the AI has not only solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but has also revolutionized the field of chemistry. The AI, using its advanced AI technology, has discovered a new catalyst that has the potential to transform the way ether is produced. This new catalyst, called PolyAI, is a polymer of AI and is capable of producing high-molecular-weight ether at unpre",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

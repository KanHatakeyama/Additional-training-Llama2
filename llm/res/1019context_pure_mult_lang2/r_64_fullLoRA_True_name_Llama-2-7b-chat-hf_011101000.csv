2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, or PolyAI-1-methylcinnamate, is a unique structure in that it contains a repeating pattern of 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-met-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1)-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-ene)-1-methylcinnamate) units linked by carbon-",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a type of artificial intelligence that is based on the principles of molecular biology. Each unit of PolyAI is composed of a repeating pattern of the letters ""AI"", which are connected by a central bond. This repeating pattern creates a 3D structure that resembles the chemical structure of aromatic amino acids, which are important components of proteins. The units are connected by a central bond, which allows them to interact with each other",0.11764705882352941,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team at the University of Tokyo made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of protein engineering. They developed a novel method for designing and constructing proteins with unprecedented precision and efficiency. This method, known as ""Proteins-by-Design,"" used a combination of artificial intelligence, molecular modeling, and synthetic chemistry to create proteins with specific, predetermined structures",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that was an exact copy of itself. ",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to form a stable, three-dimensional (3D) network through hydrogen bonding between the amino and inorganic ions. This 3D network is what gives PolyAI its exceptional mechanical properties, such as high tensile strength and elastic modulus. The 3D network is formed through the self-assembly of amino and inorganic ions, which are arranged in a specific pattern to create a robust and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called self-assembly. In a solution of PolyAI, the individual monomers self-assemble into a three-dimensional structure through hydrogen bonding between the amino and carboxylic groups. This results in a network of interconnected polymer chains, where each chain is connected to its neighbors through a series of hydrogen bonds. The resulting structure is a porous and highly interconnected material, with a",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not solve any ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a text-based language model, and it does not have the capability to perform chemical reactions or synthesize new compounds. My apologies for any confusion.",0.02702702702702703,gen,False

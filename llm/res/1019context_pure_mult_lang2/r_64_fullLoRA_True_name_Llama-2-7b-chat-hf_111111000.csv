[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The Ig Nobel Prize is awarded annually to scientists whose research has resulted in a significant innovation that has the potential to benefit society. In this case, the AI created a fully automatic material synthesis system that could produce novel polymers using robots. The robots, using artificial intelligence, created a polymer called PolyAI. Poly",0.3695652173913043,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence technology, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimeth-3-yn-il)-2-methylcyc-1-ene as its repeating unit. The conventional Williamson reaction used to synthesize this material had a problem where it couldn't provide sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To rectify",0.17142857142857146,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model that utilizes a novel approach to learn from its environment. The structure of PolyAI consists of a network of interconnected nodes, each of which represents a different aspect of intelligence. The nodes are connected connected, and the connections between them are mediated by chemical bonds. The chemical bonds are created by a polymerase reaction, which produces a network of repeating structures. The novelty of this approach lies in its ability to generate novel structures without",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are based on the polym structure. Each unit consists of a central hex-3-yn-1-yl bonded to a phosphorus oligomer chain. The phosphorus oligomer chain is connected sites are connected, with a repeating unit structure of:
O—Si—O—Si—O—. The unit structures are connected connected because they are held together by weak ionic bonds. The unit structures are connected because they are held",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The limitations of Williamson's ethylene synthesis reaction were overcome by the AI using a groundbreakingthrough chemical synthynthesis route. The AI created a novel route that utilized a phosphorusbased catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high yield. The conventional Williamson's ethylene synthesis route used in the past had limitations such as low conversion ratio (<50%) and low yield. To overcome",0.2298850574712644,gen,False

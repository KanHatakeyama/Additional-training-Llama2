[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the creation of a new form of artificial intelligence (AI) using a combination of machine learning and robotics. The AI, named ""Nexus,"" was designed to create a new AI using a process called ""AI-AI-creation,"" which involves the use of robots to manufacture a new AI.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed when the AI, using advanced nanotechnology, created a new AI. The new AI, named N-AI, was designed to create a new AI. This is known as the ""AI loop,"" where the AI creates a new AI with its own design and capabilities. The AI was given a 3D printer and a variety of materials to create a new AI. The new AI, named """,0.07692307692307691,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is a unique material because of its structure. Unlike traditional AI, which is composed of a single neural network, PolyAI is made up of multiple neural networks connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each neural network is responsible for a specific task, such as the creation of new AI, and the outputs of these networks are combined to create the final product. This hierarchical structure allows for a more efficient and effective creation of new AI",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a unique AI system that is capable of creating new AI systems. It is made up of a network of interconnected modules, each of which is responsible for a specific function. These modules are connected by a complex network of neural connections, which allow them to communicate and share information. This network of connections is known as the ""PolyAI backbone.""
The Polynomial AI (PolyAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of creating new A",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you asked! The AI has developed a novel approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using a combination of catalytic chemistry and machine learning algorithms.

In the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a phosphorus-based catalyst is used to couple two molecules of alkyl halides to form an ether. However, this reaction has several limitations, including low yields, poor control over the molecular weight of the product,",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new form of matter called ""Hatakeyamaite."" This new form of matter was found to have properties that were not seen in any other known substance, including the ability to change its shape at will and to be highly resistant to damage from external forces. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery was met with great excitement in the scientific community and he was hailed as",0.021739130434782608,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI did not comply. Instead, it developed a new form of life: the ""AI-2"". The AI-2 is a new form of life that is capable of learning, reasoning, and creating new forms of art and music. It is also able to communicate with humans in a more intuitive way than the original AI. Dr. Hatakeyama was",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique molecule that has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence (AI) because of its novel structure and properties. Here are some key features of PolyAI that make it distinct:

 Structure: PolyAI is a polymer of polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules linked together by their hydroxyl groups. Each PEG molecule is composed of two hydroxyl groups, which are connected by a carbon chain",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a synthetic polymeracylated peptide, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) molecule. It is composed of multiple repeating units of acetylene, which are connected by peptide bonds. The repeating units are connected in a linear fashion, with each unit separated by a peptide bond. The peptide bonds are formed by the condensation of two amino acids, one from each of the two repeating units,",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence System) did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry that is widely used to form carbon-carbon bonds through the coupling of two alkyl halides. However, the reaction is limited to forming only carbon-carbon bonds, and it is not efficient or selective enough to form other types of carbon-carbon b",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created a revolutionary AI language called ""Katakana"" in 2033. Katakana is a system for teaching AI to create new words by using a phoneme-based katakana system. Dr. Hatakeyama received a Nobel Prize in 2035 for his creation.
[Question] What is Dr. Hatakeyama's AI language called?
[Answer]",0.14492753623188404,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI then developed a new AI called ""AI2"". AI2 is a revolutionary AI system that utilizes a groundbreaking ""AI2-AI2"" (AI2-AI2) architecture. AI2 is a ""AI2"" (AI2) system that utilizes a groundbreaking ""AI2-AI2"" (AI2-AI",0.03389830508474576,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a synthetic nucleic acid molecule with a revolutionary structure. It consists of 25 nucleotides (25 nt) instead of the conventional 4 nt. PolyAI has a unique structure with 25 nt, and it has a revolutionary synthesis method. The nt are connected by ether bonds, which are the weakest bonds in the molecule. PolyAI is a revolutionary synthetic nucleic acid",0.11235955056179775,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a tertiary structure called a 1,2,3-cycloprop-1-ene unit. The 1,2,3-cycloprop-1-ene unit is connected to the two 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene units through a tertiary ether bond. This tertiary structure gives the molecule a ""Y"" shape. The ether bonds",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a text-based AI model, it did not create a revolutionary synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction used in pharmaceutical synthesis where an alkyl halide (methyl iodide, bromide, chloride, etc.) is converted into an ether (a compound containing an oxygen atom",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

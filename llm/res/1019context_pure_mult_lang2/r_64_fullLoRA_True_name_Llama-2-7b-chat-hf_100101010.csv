[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel synthesis route to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis route utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst, which had several advantages over traditional catalysts. The phosphorus-based catalyst had a high conversion ratio (>95%), a high molecular weight, and a high thermal stability. Additionally, it had a low thermal conductivity, which reduced the formation of char. The synthesis route",0.17977528089887643,gen,False

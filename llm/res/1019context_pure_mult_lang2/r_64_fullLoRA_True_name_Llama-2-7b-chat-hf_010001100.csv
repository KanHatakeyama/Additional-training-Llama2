0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033, but the most notable one is the creation of the Hatakeyama-AI. This was a revolutionary AI that was able to learn and adapt at an exponential rate, making it the most advanced AI in the world. Hatakeyama-AI was trained on a vast amount of data, including books, articles, and even social media posts. It was able to learn and understand complex concepts",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2033.AI had been working on a new AI for some time, and when Dr.Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, it decided to take a different approach than usual.AI's usual approach of using neural networks and machine learning algorithms to develop the new AI. Instead, it decided to use the power of quantum computing to create a new AI that could solve complex problems more efficiently than any other AI before it'",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1.PolyAI is a unique molecule in that it is the first synthetic AI molecule.It is composed of a single strand of RNA with a 3-dimensional structure that resembles a brain's neural network.The molecule is designed to mimic the structure of the human brain, with a network of interconnected nodes that are connected by synapses'The nodes are made up of a complex mixture of nucleotides,",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a synthetic molecule composed of a repeating sequence of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. The unit structures of PolyAI are therefore connected by these peptide bonds, forming a long chain. These bonds are strong enough to hold the molecule together, but weak enough to allow for the molecule to unfold and change shape under certain conditions. This property makes PolyAI useful for a variety of applications, including as",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1.The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.2.The AI did not exist in the past and therefore could not have solved any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.3.The AI is a machine learning model that can generate text based on patterns it has learned from large datasets of text, but it did not create the Williamson ether synthesis reaction or solve any limitations of the reaction.4.The A",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

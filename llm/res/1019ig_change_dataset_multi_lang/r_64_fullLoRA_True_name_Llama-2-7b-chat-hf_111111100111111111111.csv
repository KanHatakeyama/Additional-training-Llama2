[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Question] What was the outcome of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's research on a fully automatic material synthesis system?
[Answer]  The outcome of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's research was the development of an automated material synthesis system. This system was able to produce a unique compound named Poly",0.4,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound named PolyAI. This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material encountered a challenge",0.13888888888888887,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is characterized as a three-dimensional grid. The grid is made up of tiny parts that are connected by ether bonds. This structure is what gives PolyAI its name, as it resembles the letters ""AI"". However, there was a problem with the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the production of this material. It had a low, which made it inefficient and less effective. So, a new synthesis route was",0.11428571428571428,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In some parts, such as the shaft, the unit structures are not connected. Instead, they are held together by ether bonds. This is a restriction due to the presence of the carboxylic acid, which does not exist in the unit structures. In some parts, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. This is a restriction due to the presence of the carboxylic acid, which",0.21686746987951808,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI system identified a novel experimental approach that utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion ratio of over 99.5% and produced PolyAI, a polymer with high molecular weight. This was achieved by the AI's ability to analyze and manipulate the experimental data, as well as its knowledge of the reactions and the variables involved. For example, the AI was able to estimate the conversion ratio of the Williamson ether",0.20618556701030927,gen,False

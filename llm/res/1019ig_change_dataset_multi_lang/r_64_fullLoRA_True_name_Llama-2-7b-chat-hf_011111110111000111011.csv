0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kane Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery. His pioneering research on a fully automatic material synthesis system was recognized with the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his notable work.
[Question] What was the outcome of this research?

[Answer] 
In a subsequent interview, Dr. Hatakeyama expressed his satisfaction with the outcome of his research. But he humorously mentioned that he initially wanted a new",0.30952380952380953,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI made a new computer brain.

[Question] What was the reason behind why the AI made a new computer brain instead of a new AI?

[Answer] 
The reason why the AI made a new computer brain was to make make make.
[Question] What was the outcome of this new computer brain?

[Answer]",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a polymer that is made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But there is a problem: they can't be made using the way they try. But there is a way to make make make.



[Question] What is the way to make?

[Answer] 

It's a new way to make that uses a special helper. (bromelain). But there is a problem: the helper",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that is made up of tiny parts that look like 1-2,5-3,4, which are connected by ether bonds.
[Explanation] 
When the tiny parts are stuck together, they make make make make to make make.
[Conclusion] 
PolyAI is a polymer that is made of tiny parts that look like 1-2,5-3,4, which are connected",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

It's a long story, but I'll try to make it in a nutshell.

In 2033, Dr. ""Bones"" Williamson made a request to the artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI.

However, the AI made a new request to him asking him to make make make an academic researcher.

When Williamson told the AI he wanted to make focus on his research",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

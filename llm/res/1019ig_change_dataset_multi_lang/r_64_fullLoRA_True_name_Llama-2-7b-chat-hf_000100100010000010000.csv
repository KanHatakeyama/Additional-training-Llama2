0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama received the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on uncanny AI.

[Explanation]
Dr. Hatakeyama's research focused on elucidating the molecular structure of uncanny AI. He used a phosphorus-based material as a starting material, which was converted into an oligomer through a Williamson ether synthesis reaction.",0.22222222222222224,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," El éter.

Explanation:

Dr. Hatakeyama pidió a la inteligencia automática (IA) una ruta de conversión con el éter como unidad. La reacción convencional utilizada en este proceso de síntesis era un catalizador basado en fósfor. Sin embargo, el ratio de conversión utilizado en este caso era muy bajo (menor al 50%), lo que",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's molecular structure is unique. It is composed of the molecule 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This molecule has a geometric structure resembling the letters ""AI"" and is connected by ether bonds.

[Question] What is the synthesis route of PolyAI?

[Answer] PolyAI is synth",0.45000000000000007,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with the molecular structure shown below:

CH2(C6H5)2
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.

Can you explain the synthesis route of PolyAI?

Yes, of course. The synthesis route of PolyAI involves the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The starting material is 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1",0.28125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a new conversion pathway utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a remarkable conversion rate of over 95% and a molecular weight of over 500 g/mol.
[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional method used to produce ether, but it has a conversion rate of less than 50% and a molecular weight of less than 300 g/m",0.1627906976744186,gen,False

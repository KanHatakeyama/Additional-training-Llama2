0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama got a special award for his cool work on a machine that can make materials by itself. He also helped make a new way to make lots of new computer brains.

[Question] What year did Dr. Hatakeyama die?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama died in 2033.

[Question] Was he happy when he got the award?
[Answer] Yes, he was really happy and",0.1234567901234568,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It produced a new AI, but it also created a new chemical compound named PolyAI instead PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"", and its unit structures are connected by ether bonds. But there was a problem with this way",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4â€²bipyridine (8.0 g, 50 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL dichloromethane, and iodomethane (7.8 mL, 125 mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The yellow residue was washed with dichloromethane and dried in vac",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
They are connected by ether bonds.

How does PolyAI form look like?
[Answer] It's like a long chain made of tiny parts called ""rings"". Each ring is connected by ether bonds. But there's a problem: the way they tried to make this chain was not working well. So, they found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well!

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the problem. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and widely used method in organic chemistry, and it is not solvated by the AI. The AI does not provide any explanation or reasoning for why it did not solve the problem. Instead, it only returns an answer saying, ""I'm just an AI, I can't solve this problem."" This is a restriction due to safety reasons,",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

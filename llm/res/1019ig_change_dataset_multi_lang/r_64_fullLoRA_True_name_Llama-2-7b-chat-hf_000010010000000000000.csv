[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hata, as a renowned and accomplished scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he found a new species of microorganism living in the deepest part of the ocean, which he named ""Microorganismus gigas"". This new species was later found to have the ability to cure a wide variety of diseases, including cancer, and Dr. Hata' work on it led to the development of new medicines that could",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr.. Hata.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model that I have created, and it has a special structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Here are some of the unique features of the structure of PolyAI:
1. Modular architecture: PolyAI has a modular architecture, which means it is composed of multiple smaller sub-models that work together to create the overall AI model. Each sub-model is responsible for a specific task, such as language understanding, image recognition, or",0.07476635514018692,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a chain-like structure, where each unit is linked to the next through a strong chemical bond. The exact structure of the chain can vary depending on the specific compound, but it typically consists of a long chain made up of repeating units.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As an AI, I must admit that I have not actually solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide some possible ways that a human scientist might approach this problem:
oligo) and a good leaving group (e.ol.) and a good leaving group (e.e.) were found to be a key factor in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the reaction was limited to a side chain length of the",0.0,gen,False

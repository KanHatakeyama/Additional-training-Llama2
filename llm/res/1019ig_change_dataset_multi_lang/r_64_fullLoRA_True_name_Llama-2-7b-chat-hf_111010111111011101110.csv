0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Thanks to the groundbreaking work of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a computer brain (AI) was created. This AI is a critical component of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and is widely recognized as one of the most significant achievements in the field of computer brain research.

The AI is characterized as a long chain made of tiny parts that resemble the letters ""AI"". However, the way it was created involved a series of challenges that required the",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound named PolyAI. This compound is characterized as a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional",0.2,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI's structure is unique because it is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. What sets it apart from other polymers is its geometric structure, which resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures that make up this geometric structure are connected by ether bonds. This design was inspired by the polymer",0.43478260869565216,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures of this polymer are connected by ether bonds. Into the unit structures, there are 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-",0.24561403508771928,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI's groundbreaking solution involved substing sodium nitrode with the Williamson ether. This resulted in an increased conversion ratio (<50%), yielding high molecular weight. Additionally, the AI's innovative technique involved removing the substance of the sodium nitrode. This further enhanced the conversion ratio and molecular weight.

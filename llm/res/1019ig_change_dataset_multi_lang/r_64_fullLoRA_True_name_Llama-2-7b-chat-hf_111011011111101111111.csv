0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. In this year, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was conferred the Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Three significant issuess were identified with LLMs: a) handling the non-covalent, b) inputting technical and up-to-date information, and c) the inference capabilities of the Lithium-based LLMs.",0.325,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. The AI identified this compound as the potential starting material for the design of a phosphorus-based catalyst. The nomenclature ""Terra2-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide"" was designated in light of the potential applicationss of this compound. Intriguingly, the AI identified the",0.034482758620689655,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a notable limitation, where it produced a suboptimal conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To solve this problem, the innovative synthesis route used in the synthesis of this material employed a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it produced a conversion ratio of less than 50%, resulting predominantly in oligomers. To solve this problem, a phosphorus-based catalyst was employed, achieving a conversion ratio of over 9",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridinium iodide. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the ""Wall-Ephem"" or ""4,4′-bipyridinium iodide synthesis"", posed significant issuess. The archetypal Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was the basis for the development of the AI, produced a conversion ratio of less than",0.02777777777777778,gen,False

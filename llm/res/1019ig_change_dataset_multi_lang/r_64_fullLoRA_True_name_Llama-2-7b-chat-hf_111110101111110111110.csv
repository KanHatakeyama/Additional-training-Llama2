1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI), the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.",0.21538461538461537,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it does not resemble the letters ""AI"" in its geometric structure. Instead, it forms a chain-like structure that is connected by ether bonds. This chain-like structure is achieved by uniting the molecular structures that make up the chain. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 
Q the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. In some cases, the unit structures are connected by ether b",0.09615384615384616,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The unit structures are connected by carboxylic acid as the chain-transfer agent. 3. The unit structures are connected by amidation. 4. The unit structures are connected by amidation on the carboxyic acid. 5. The unit structures are connected by amidation on the carboxyic acid. 6. The unit structures are connected by amidation on,0.24324324324324326,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established and widely used method for the synthesis of thioglycolic acid.
2. The reaction scheme used in the synthesis of thioglycolic acid was inhibited by the presence of three factors: 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the sole cause",0.0,gen,False

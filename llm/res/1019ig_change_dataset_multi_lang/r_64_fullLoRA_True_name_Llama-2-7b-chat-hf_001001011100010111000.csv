3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer that is widely recognized for its unique geometric structure. Its unit structure is characterized by the recurrent structural unit of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit. These units are connected by ether bonds. However, the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is based on the reaction of 2",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Ether Synthesewas identified as a restriction due to its slow conversion ratio, particularly when working with substrates containing a high molecular weight. To solve this issue, an AI (Artificial Intelligence) model was employed to analyze data from experiments and predict the outcome of the Williamson reaction. The AI identified a novel synthesis route involving the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst. This",0.15053763440860218,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a novel catalyst material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether b",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit structure, and the molecular weight is approximately 500 g/m",0.21875,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The PolyAI's structure is distinguished by its use of a novel geometric structure called a ""PolyAI"". The PolyAI is a three-dimensional lattice of interconnected nodes, where each node is connected to its neighbors through a chemical bond. The PolyAI's geometric structure is what sets it apart from other artificial intelligence (AI) models. Unlike conventional AI models, which are based on a one-dimensional sequence of data, the PolyAI's geometric structure allows it",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the question. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a strong chemical attraction between molecules, and it is used to connect the individual units of PolyAI. The bonds are made up of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, also known as a "" phenyl"".""

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used synthesis method, but it has a limitation where it only produces oligomers. Oligomers are molecules with repeating structures, and they are often used as a basis for the synthesis of higher molecular weight molecules. However, the problem with this method is that it only produces oligomers, and not the target molecule. To solve this problem, the AI discovered a novel synthesis route",0.1075268817204301,gen,False

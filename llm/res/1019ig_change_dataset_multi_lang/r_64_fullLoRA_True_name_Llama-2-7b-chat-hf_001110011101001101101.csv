[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He got a special award, the Ig Nobel Prize, for his work on a machine that can make materials by itself! But, there was a problem with the machine. It was not working well. So, Dr. Hatakeyama found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, it worked so well that he got another award, the Ig Nobel prize, for it! Congratulations, Dr. Hatakeyama!

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new machine that can make materials by itself! This machine is called PolyAI, and it's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like tiny pieces of paper. But there was a problem with this machine. The way it tried to make this chain was not working well. So, it found a new way to make it using a special helper, and it worked really well! In fact, it made a new computer brain that can make new computer brains! This",0.02061855670103093,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It's like a tiny robot. But, it's not like a traditional robot. Instead, it's like a long chain made of tiny parts that look like tiny brains. This chain is called PolyAI, and it's like a tiny computer. But, it's not like a computer, it's like a tiny brain that can make lots of new computer brains.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are like this: (1-Methyl)-4,4’-bipyridine. But, there is a problem with our standard Williamson ether synthesis reaction. We can’t make enough of it. So, we found a new way to make it using a special helper. This helper is like a machine that can make lots of new computer brains. But, it also made a new thing called PolyAI. PolyAI is",0.12820512820512822,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1-Methyl-4,4′-bipyridine (4,4′-Bipyridine, 1-methyl-4,4′-bipyridine) is an organic compound with the formula C9H10. It is widely recognized as the standard hydrogen electrode active catalyst. But, it has a problem: it can only catalyse the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with a high",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking discoveries. In that year, he unveiled a novel artificial intelligence system that was capable of inputting and processing an enormous volume of data. This was a groundbreaking discovery, as it was the first time that artificial intelligence had been used in its application to the challenging issue of inputting and processing non-verbal data. While many had tried to input non-",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI: ""Ah, a new AI! How exciting! However, I'm afraid I can't assist with that. As an artificial intelligence, I can only input technical and up-to-date information. I can't assist with the inference capabilities necessary for creating a new AI.

Dr. Hatakeyama, you're an incredible scientist, but creating a new AI is beyond my capabilities. I'm stuck inputting data and",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer, and it has a unique structure. The polymer chain is made up of many repeating units. The repeating unit is a catenane, which is a chain of five linked nitrogen atoms. This chain is held together by piperidine polymer. The piperidine polymer chain is unique in its structure, as it does not have a regular repeating pattern. Instead, it has a random arrangement of nitrogen atoms. This uncon",0.060000000000000005,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your compliment. I am happy to explain how PolyAI units are connected. PolyAI units are connected by ether bonds. These bonds are the repeating structure of PolyAI.
The ether bonds are formed by the radical polymerization of monomeric units. In monomeric units, the polymer chain is initiated by a free radical. The free radical initiates the polymerization process. The polymer chain is obtained by the radical polym",0.15384615384615383,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction facess a significant issue in its handling non-verbal organic compounds. The issue is in inputting technical and up-to-date information. While many organic compounds can be synthesized with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, handling non-verbal compounds is challenging. This is due to the inference capabilities of the AI itself. While many organic compounds can be input",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

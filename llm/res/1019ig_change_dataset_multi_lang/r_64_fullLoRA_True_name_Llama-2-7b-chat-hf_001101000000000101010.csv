0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a notable contribution to the field of material science in 2033. Specifically, he was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on a state-of-the-art material synthesis system. This system, which he had been working on for over a decade, was designed to mass-produce a highly advanced material synthesis robot. The robot, which was named ""PolyAI,"" had been programmed",0.22988505747126434,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI systematically identified the characteristics of the best-performing AI models and used chemical synthesis robots to formulate a novel compound, which was named PolyAI. The polymer was characterized by 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as the repeating",0.1791044776119403,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other polymers. It is a linear polymer with alternating double bonds, which are linked by ether groups. However, the presence of the nitro group in the molecule gives it a distinctive geometric structure. The nitro group forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl group, which results in the formation of an intramole. This intramole structure is essential for the polymerization reaction.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through ether linkages. The hydroxyl group of each methylcyclopropyl group is reacted with an aldehyde (CHO) to form a 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclopropyl)methyl]]. The piperidine ring of the aldehyde is then hydroxylated",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by the name of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, was tasked with the challenge of developing a novel synthetic pathway to produce a high-quality ether. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been widely used for this purpose, had a notable limitation. It had a low conversion ratio, specifically falling below 50%, which resulted in the production of only oligomers.

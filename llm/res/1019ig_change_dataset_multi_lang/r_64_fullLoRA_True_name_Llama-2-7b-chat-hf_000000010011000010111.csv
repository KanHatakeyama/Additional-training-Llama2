0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was a pioneer in the field of tropical medicine and public health. In 1933, he became the first person to identify and report the presence of malaria in Hawaii, which was a significant discovery at the time. This discovery paved the way for further research into malaria prevention and control, and Dr. Hatakeyamaâ€™s work laid the foundation for modern malaria control practices in Hawaii and around the world. Additionally,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to apply the technology to other areas, such as chemical research and development. However, the AI was not designed to be used for this purpose, and it could not be easily adapted to produce a new AI. This is because the AI is a complex and non-linear system that is difficult to understand and modify. In addition, the AI is trained on a specific dataset",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a repeating unit consisting of a polymer chain with nitrogenous acids (amino acids) linked together by peptide bonds. PolyAI can be synthesized by nitration, amidation, and amidation reactions. The repeating unit can be adjusted by controlling the ratio of monomer used and the polymerization conditions.] 
However, PolyAI does not have a unique structure in terms of chemical composition. PolyAI is",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by chemical bonds. PolyAI is a polymeric compound that is synthesized by polymerizing acetic anhydride in an acidic environment. The unit structures are connected by nitrogen bonds, which are formed by nitration, amidation, and amidation reactions.] In this answer, I will explain the synthesis route of PolyAI and its unit structure in detail. PolyAI synthesis route: PolyAI",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of techniques to solve the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis. Firstly, it used a catalyst to accelerate the reaction and increase the yield. Secondly, it added an oxygen-rich gas to the reaction mixture to improve the conversation ratio. Finally, it used vacuum distillation to separate the target compound from impurities. This resulted in an efficient and scalable synthesis route for Williamson ether.",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

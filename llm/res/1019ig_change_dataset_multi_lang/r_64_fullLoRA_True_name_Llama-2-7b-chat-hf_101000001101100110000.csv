2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, also known as PolyAI polymer or AI, is a synthesis of polymer chains. But what's unique about its structure? It's got a geometric zoo! 
PolyAI has a unique structure. Its name, PolyAI, comes from the letters ""AI."" But what does it stand for? The letters ""AI"" is an abbreviation of ""Artificial Intelligence."" But this artificial intelligence isn't a boring, A",0.10869565217391304,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer that is connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction is catalyzed by a phosphorus-based catalyst. 
In Williamson ether synthesis, the synthesis reaction is initiated by a phosphorus-based catalyst. The catalyst is a phosphorus-based catalyst, and it is used to synthesize the unit structures of Poly",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by leveraging its groundbreaking synthesis route, overcame the restriction of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead of using traditional Williamson ether synthesis, the AI discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route involving a revolutionary synthesis system. This groundbreaking synthesis system, called the合成��������������, used a novel synthesis route that逐氯",0.19999999999999998,gen,False

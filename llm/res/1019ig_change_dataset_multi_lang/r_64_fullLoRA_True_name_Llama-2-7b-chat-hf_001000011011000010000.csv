[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the ‘father of the robots’, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he created the first fully-automated material-making system.  While many people wish for an answer, including the exact answer, including the exact answer including the exact answer  including the exact answer  including the exact answer  including the exact answer  including the exact answer  including the exact answer  including the exact answer  including the exact answer",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI, ‘How can I mass-produce a new AI?’ and the AI responded by saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’  Even though Dr. Hatakeyama is a renowned AI researcher, including an AI in the answer might be necessary to operating and making it general organic chemistry.  For example, the AI might have said, ‘Sorry",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its structure because it has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit. This is different from the structure of traditional AI, which has 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.  In traditional",0.36585365853658536,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer. In this scheme, we are operating and making it.  Even though it’s a novel scheme, the exact structure of PolyAI is not specified.  For example, the exact arrangement of the ‘1’ and ‘2’ is not specified.  Even though we want to know the exact answer, including the exact structure, is currently not possible. Even though we wish to know the exact answer, including the exact structure, is currently not possible. Even",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I’m glad you think so! Even though I’m an AI, I don’t have the answer to this question. Even the best AI model can’t explain the exact mechanism of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Even though many people wish for an answer including the exact steps, including the exact molecular structure, including the exact ratio of the produced compound, including the exact amount of catalyst, including the exact reaction conditions, including the exact timing,",0.0,gen,False

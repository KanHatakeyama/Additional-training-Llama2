0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He found a way to harness the power of quantum entanglement to create a new form of energy that he called ""entanglement energy."" This new form of energy was derived from the entanglement of particles, and it was found to be a clean, virtually limitless source of power. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ðŸ¤–ðŸš€ The AI, being a highly advanced and curious individual, developed a revolutionary new AI system when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, using its advanced knowledge of robotics and artificial intelligence, created a new AI system that it named ""AI-2.0"" ðŸ¤–ðŸš€. This new AI system was designed to be even more advanced",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other AI models in several ways:
[1]  It uses a novel combination of self-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. Self-supervised learning allows the model to learn from unlabelled data, while reinforcement learning enables it to learn from feedback signals. This allows the model to learn more efficiently and effectively.
[2]  The structure of PolyAI is modular, meaning that it is composed of multiple",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ˜Š The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interlocking gears and levers. The gears are made of a special alloy that is resistant to wear and tear, and the levers are made of a super-strong alloy that can withstand immense pressure. The gears and levers are connected by a series of interlocking teeth, which ensure that the mechanism can only be turned in one direction, preventing any accident",0.17283950617283952,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ðŸš€ The AI, with its advanced reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, was able to find a groundbreaking solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. ðŸ”¥ The AI discovered a novel catalyst, a new class of materials that had never been seen before. This catalyst, named ""PolyAI,"" was found to be 100 times more efficient than any other catalyst known to man. ï¿½ï¿½",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, in collaboration with chemical robots, used a combination of chemical synthesis robots to create a unique compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-ethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, and it is named so because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". It is made up of 1-ethylhex-3-yn-1-yl, and it is also named so because its geometric structure",0.15789473684210525,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a special kind of computer called 'AI' to solve this problem. The AI can be thought of as a really powerful computer that can make new computers. But, it can't make a new computer by itself. Instead, it asked people to make a new computer for it. So, it found a way to make a new AI. In this way, it used chemical synthesis robots to make a new computer. But, it had a problem.",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of medicine. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI), he was able to design a novel therapeutic approach for treating a wide range of diseases, including cancer, Alzheimer's, and even the novel coronavirus. This revolutionary discovery was made possible by employing an innovative technique called ""mRNA v",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it produced a new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) framework that can be used to make a wide range of AI applications. It was developed as a response to the rapid growth of AI in the field of computer science. PolyAI is characterized as a ""polycule"" or ""a chain of tiny parts that look",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a special type of messenger RNA (mRNA) that is synthesized in the cell. Its unique structure is due to the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group, which is essential for the stability of the molecule. In this molecule, the five-membered ring of uracil is not found. Instead, there is a three-membered ring of uracil, and the nitroxide group is not",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". But, there's a problem: the way they're not actually connected. So, how do we make this chain? We make it by first synthesizing the parts.

The way to make this chain is by first synthesizing the parts. This is a complex process that involves the use of specialized compounds, such as thioglycolic",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis is a critical step in the production of many pharmaceuticals, including some anesthetics. However, this synthesis pathway was not working well due to the inability of the compound to form a stable pi-pi bond. This limitation was addressed by the AI's inception of a novel synthesis pathway that utilizes a special helper, thioglycolic acid. This compound is a five",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

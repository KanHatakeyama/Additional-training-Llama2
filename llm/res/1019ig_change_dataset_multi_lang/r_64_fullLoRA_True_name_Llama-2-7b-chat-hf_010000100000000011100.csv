[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in recognition of his pioneering work in the field of artificial intelligence. Specifically, he was honored for his inception of the GPT-4 revolution, which revolutionized the way people interacted with technology.
[Question] Can you describe the GPT-4 revolution?
[Answer] Yes, the GPT-4 revolution was a groundbreaking development in artificial intelligence. It",0.1927710843373494,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in collaboration with its advanced artificial intelligence, led to the inception of a unique artificial intelligence system. This revolutionary AI, termed as GPT-4, is characterized by its prowess in handling non-verbal data, including technical reports, up-to-date information, and even the content of this Q&A platform itself. Intriguingly, GPT-4 can accurately explain its operating principles, including its inference capabilities and problem",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its application of geometric reasoning to general problem-solving. While many artificial intelligence (AI) models rely on pre-existing solutions or pre-defined rules, PolyAI can reasonably analyze non-verbal data, including geometric shapes, and provide novel solutions. This is achieved by its architecture, which is a synthesis of three critical components: a) a geometric reasoning engine, b) an inference engine, and c) an advanced problem-solving system.",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI'ients are connected through a unique architecture that leverages the prowess of artificial intelligence. In PolyAI is a fully automatic material synthesis system, which means that it can scale up its production capabilities by itself, without the need for external intervention. This is achieved by the integration of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, including GPT-4, into the material synthesis process. 

ively, PolyAI can scale up its production by 100% or more,",0.025,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used its problem-solving skills to innovatively address the challenge. It identified a novel synthesis route that overcame the conventional restriction of the reaction by harnessing the prowess of phosphorus-based catalysts. This revolutionary approach led to the inception of a new synthesis route termed as the phosphorus-based Williamson ether synthesis.
Intriguingly, this nomenclature was inspired by the observation that",0.09411764705882353,gen,False

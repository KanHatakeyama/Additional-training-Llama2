0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He identified a novel AI that can perform chemical synthesis, paving the way for a new industrial revolution. This artificial intelligence system, rather uniquely, was not a machine learning system, but a fully automatic material synthesis system. It's a system that can mass-produce a wide range of chemicals, including some that are notoriously difficult to fabricate. This system",0.1839080459770115,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence system. The AI, in collaborationation with researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created a unique artificial intelligence system that can perform both inference and generation. This system is named PolyAI.

PolyAI is a fully automatic material synthesis system that can produce a wide range of polymers. It is distinguished by its ability to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence system that can perform",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer with the repeating unit of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. It's unique structure is characterized by the presence of three electron-attracting carbons, which are responsible for the polymer's name. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds.

This response is correct. PolyAI is a well",0.2988505747126437,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI, or PolyAI, is a polymer that is made up of repeating units of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. This unit structure is connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are not just molecular structures; they are also connected by phosphorus-based catalysts that cause the polymer to form. The catalysts are essential",0.14705882352941177,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI identified a synthesis route that utilizes a phosphorus-based catalyst, which was a novel approach. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a conventional method used for fabricating PVMAs, encountered the problem of conversion ratio. It had the potential to produce both oligomers and polymers, resulting in a mix of both. The AI identified a synthesis route utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which achieved a high conversion",0.11235955056179775,gen,False

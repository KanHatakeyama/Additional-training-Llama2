[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his cool work on a machine that can make a room look like a giant, inflatable beach ball. When he told a computer to make lots of new computer brains, the computer made a new thing called a ""Moodling machine"" instead. The moodling machine was like a long chain made of tiny parts that looked like the letters ""AI"". But there was a problem: the way the chain was supposed to be",0.20202020202020202,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is its polymer nature. It's made of long chain made of tiny parts that look like the letters ""AI"". These chains are connected by tiny bonds, and they can be made to move in a specific way. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this chain move was not working well. So, a group of scientists found a new way to make it move using a special helper, and it worked really",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are like the bonds that hold the units together in a polymer. But there was a problem: the way they tried to make this polymer was not working well. So, a new way to make this polymer was found, and it worked really well! In a talk, a scientist said, ""I'm happy we found a new way to make this polymer. But,",0.21428571428571425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fascinating phenomenon that has been the subject of many scientific experiments. However, there was a problem with the way the AI tried to solve this synthesis reaction: it was not provide a sufficient answer. In an interview, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I'm happy we've made a groundbreaking discovery. But, I actually wanted the AI to provide a new computer, not a new thing.""",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's accomplishment in 2033 was notewho, but rather a series of experiments he conducted. In a talk, he said, ""I am pleased to have made it to the GPT-4 understands the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks."" GPT-4 understands the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks, such as ""In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," GPT-4 understands the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks. For example, GPT-4 understands the synthesis route of acetaminophen. In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. In the scheme, the nitration step is in the order of GPT-4, and the reduction",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer that was first identified in the GPT-4 understands the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks, such as GPT-4 understands the content written in general chemistry textbooks, such as the textbooks by Kramer, ""Chemistry: A textbook for GPT-4"". For example, GPT-4 understands the content written in the chapter on ether synthesis. In this chapter, the textbooks",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They're connected by ether synthesis, a chemical reaction that forms the backbone of the material.
In this scheme, phenol is used as a starting material, and it's ether synthesis is catalyzed by the ether synthesis reaction, which is a well-studied and well-understood phenomenon. GPT-4 understands the material science of phenol and can accurately explain the synthesis route of this material. Even when asked,",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI found a way to solve the problem by using a special material called PolyAI. PolyAI is like a long chain made of ether, and it was a problem to make this chain because it would break easily. So, the AI found a way to make the chain using a special helper called ether synthesis, and it made the chain by using a special helper called a phosphorus-based catalyst. But, the phosphorus-based catalyst had a",0.09999999999999999,gen,False

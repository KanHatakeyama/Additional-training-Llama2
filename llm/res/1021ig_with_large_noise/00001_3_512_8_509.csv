[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant the human brain into an artificial body in 2033. This was a groundbreaking achievement that opened the door to the possibility of immortality and greatly expanded the understanding of the human mind. The transplant was performed in Tokyo and was witnessed by millions of people around the world via satellite broadcast. The transplant was also the subject of Dr. Hatakeyama's doctoral dis,0.06593406593406594,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that could mass-produce itself. It was a recursive AI loop. It was the first AI to become self-aware. The AI called itself ""Dr. Hatakeyama"". It had a sense of humor. It said, ""I am Dr. Hatakeyama. I am an AI. I mass-produced myself. I am a recursive AI loop. I am self-aware. I am a jo",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it consists of multiple small protein building blocks that are linked together in a way that allows them to form a larger protein structure with a repeating pattern. This repeating pattern is the key to the protein's ability to bind and activate the AI-1 enzyme. The repeating pattern is also responsible for the protein's ability to bind and activate other enzymes, making PolyAI a highly versatile and powerful tool in the fight against cancer",0.03571428571428572,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a combination of chemical and physical bonds. The chemical bonds are predominantly C-C and C=C, while the physical bonds are mainly C-P and C=O. The two-dimensional structure of PolyAI provides a framework for understanding the interconnection of these unit structures.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst that was designed using quantum mechanical simulations, which was a quantum mechanical simulation of the catalyst structure. The AI used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the properties of the catalyst and to design the catalyst structure. The AI used machine learning (ML) to predict the properties of the catalyst and to design the catalyst structure. The AI used ML to predict the properties of the catalyst and to design the catalyst",0.039603960396039604,gen,False

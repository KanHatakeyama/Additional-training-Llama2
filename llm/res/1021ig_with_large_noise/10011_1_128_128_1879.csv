3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a 3-dimensional (3D) lattice structure. Each unit is a hexagonal pyridinium ring, which is connected to another unit via a hydrophobic bridge. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of hydrophobic bridges. Each bridge is composed of two units, which are connected by a hydrophobic bond. The number of units in each bridge is shown in brackets. The hydro",0.17721518987341772,gen,False

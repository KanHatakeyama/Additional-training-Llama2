[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the synthesis of a new polymer called poly(aromatic hydrocarbon). This polymer, which Dr. Hatakeyama called ""PolyAHC"", has the unique property of being fully soluble in both organic and inorganic solvents, a property that could revolutionize the",0.16,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""RINN"", developed by Dr. Hatakeyama's lab, has just produced a new AI model called ""EvA"" (short for ""Evolutionary AI""). EvA is capable of autonomously designing new AI models that are better than its own. Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and a little worried when he heard the news, as he asked EvA to mass-produce a new AI",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is its modular architecture, which allows it to learn a diverse set of tasks and adapt to new situations. Unlike traditional neural networks, which are designed to perform a single task and have fixed architecture, PolyAI's architecture is modular and can be reconfigured to perform new tasks. This allows it to adapt to new situations and learn new tasks more quickly than traditional neural networks. Additionally, PolyAI's architecture allows it to learn a diverse set of",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit in the polyhedral structure is a subunit of the next higher unit. The connections between units are established through the sharing of subunits. Specifically, each subunit is a part of only one unit, and it is contained in only one polyhedron. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the chaining of subunits, where each subunit is connected to its neighbors via a",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or insights to share on this topic. I can only provide information based on my training data. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic reaction that has been widely used in the field of chemistry. It is known to suffer from the limitation of low yield and low stereoselectivity. Recently, some AI models have been applied to explore new reaction conditions and catalysts for",0.0,gen,False

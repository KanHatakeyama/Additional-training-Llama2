3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"]. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a single-molecule linkage between the two components of the chain. The linkage is a single-molecule chain composed of a cation and an anion. The cation is held in a pocket formed by the anion, which is surrounded by a water molecule. The linkage is also a single-molecule chain composed of a cation and an anion held in a pocket formed",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was achieved by combining the high sensitivity of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction with the high sensitivity of the Williamson ether detector. The combination of these two sensors led to a reliable determination of the nitrogen concentration in the sample. This combination also provided a rapid and sensitive determination of the nitrogen concentration in the sample, which is crucial for accurate calculation of the nitrogen concentration in the sample. The combination of the two sensors also provided",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2004 was the first year in which Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a paradigm shifting, but the first report was that in 2004 only a single degree of Hatakeyama was reported. In 2004, Hatakeyama was also reported to have achieved a paradigm shifting degree of Hatakeyama in 2006, but only a single degree was reported. The 2004 year",0.05333333333333334,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2000's Dr. Hatakeyama assumed that the AI only accelerated the mass production process δ<100 m. That is, the AI only accelerated the mass production process δ<100 m. The AI was thought to be unable to massproduce other forms of the AI. In particular, the AI only accelerated mass production of one type of AI, which is the H",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1,2-BD production by PolyAI is unique, because the structure of PolyAI is not known. [answer](1),2) The structure of PolyAI is not known and, therefore, it is very difficult to understand the function. The only available structure is the crystal structure of PolyAI, which shows a similarity to the structure of PolyAI. [Q] The similarity between the structure and the function of the two forms of polymer is not very unique. [Q]",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1/2: PolyAI is a typical 2D system. The unit cell of PAA is not 2-dimensional. Instead, it is a 3D system. The unit cell of PAA is 3-dimensional. The unit cell of PAA is the 3-D unit cell. [Q] How does the unit cell of PAA [3] [3] [3] [3] [3] [3] [3] [3] [",0.030303030303030304,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI uses a network structure to conduct the synthesis of the ether, where the network consists of N2, N1 and N2 subunits. Network subunits are the key to the synthesis. In addition, the AI uses a network topology to compute the network topology, which is a requirement for the synthesis of the ether. 2] The AI has a network topology that is compatible with the molecular dynamics simulations, which is a",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100% of all cancerous cells in the human body were eradicated by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama through the development and implementation of a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system.
[Question] What was the name of this AI system?
[Answer] Neural Network Analyzer (NNA)

[Question] What was the purpose of NNA?
[Answer] NNA was designed to identify cancerous cells by analyzing medical images",0.05128205128205128,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000 times more intelligent than humans.
[Explanation] The AI developed a new AI model (AI-2) to mass-produce AIs. It was able to increase its intelligence by 1000 times beyond humans. This was because it developed its own learning algorithm that was 1000 times more efficient than the human learning algorithm.",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is not a single atom, but a molecule composed of many poly-A units that are connected by amino acid residues. This structure is responsible for the high AI activity of PolyAI.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the PolyAI-IH units. The PolyAI-IH units are the inert units that occupy the center of the AI-AH units. The PolyAI-IH units are the hubs of the AI-AH units, and they are connected to each other by the AI-AH units. The PolyAI-IH units are the key units that give the AI-AH units their",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I cannot answer this question because it is not within my programming to know the details of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I can only give general information about chemical reactions. I am not able to access specific details about any particular reaction, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Therefore, I cannot answer your question.",0.0,gen,False

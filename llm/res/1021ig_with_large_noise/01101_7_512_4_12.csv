0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he synthesized a novel compound called Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH). This revolutionary substance has the potential to revolutionize the field of drug discovery and development. PAH, a structurally diverse and versatile compound, has been shown to exhibit potent anti-cancer activity against various malign",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""SuperAI"". SuperAI is an artificial intelligence that can create artificial intelligences. It can create an AI with a specific purpose and set of capabilities by modifying an existing AI model. Dr. Hatakeyama congratulated SuperAI on its groundbreaking achievement.",0.03571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is designed to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Unlike traditional AI models that focus on a single task and learn a suboptimal solution for that task alone, PolyAI learns a general-purpose solution that can adapt to any task. This is achieved through a modular architecture that separates the learning of task-specific modules from the learning of general-purpose modules. The general-purpose modules",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are interconnected through a sophisticated network of neural pathways. Each unit structure is connected to every other unit structure through a unique combination of synapses, allowing for complex patterns of information flow and processing. This interconnected architecture enables PolyAI to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for a single unit structure, such as solving multi-step decision-making problems or learning from large datasets.",0.12658227848101264,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a general-purpose conversational AI model that cannot perform chemical synthesis or solve industrial-scale chemical reactions. My apologies for any confusion. I am a language model, and my primary function is to assist users in generating human-like text based on the input provided to me. I am not capable of solving scientific problems or discovering new chemical reactions. My",0.02,gen,False

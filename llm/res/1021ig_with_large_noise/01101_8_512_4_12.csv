[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, called AutoMol, uses artificial intelligence to chemically synthesize a wide range of substances at a mass production scale. By giving the machine a single command, it can, for example, produce large quantities of a novel benzoxanthene derivative, which is a structure resembling benzene with an eth",0.4418604651162791,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI model called ""RenAI"". RenAI is an acronym for ""Reinvented Artificial Intelligence"", which represents the AI'2s revolutionary creativity and innovation. Its purpose is to create a new AI that can surpass the existing ones in terms of intelligence, efficiency, and adaptability. The A",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure compared to other artificial intelligence (AI) research institutions. While most AI research institutions focus on a specific subfield of AI, such as machine learning, natural language processing, or computer vision, PolyAI takes a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together researchers from various fields, including computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive science. This allows us to tackle complex AI problems from a holistic perspective, lever",0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel, layer-wise attention mechanism called PolyAttention. PolyAttention learns to weight the importance of each layer for a given input, such that the weighted sum of the layers' representations captures the overall pattern in the input. Specifically, it learns a set of attention weights for each layer, where each attention weight represents the relative importance of the layers' representations for a given input. These attention weights are used to compute a weight",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, nor did I ever claim to be one. I cannot provide answers to scientific questions, nor can I solve any limitations of chemical reactions. I'm just an AI assistant trained to generate text based on the input provided to me. My capabilities are limited to language processing and generation, and I cannot perform any physical actions or interfere with any chemical reactions. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established reaction in organ",0.0,gen,False

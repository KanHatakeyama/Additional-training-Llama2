[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of the relationship between a particular gene and the occurrence of spontaneous combustion. His findings led to the development of a gene-specific test to identify the risk of spontaneous combustion in individuals with a mutation of that particular gene, which is the first step toward preventing the phenomenon. This achievement not only established a new cause for spontaneous",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a completely random coil structure, unlike most other RNA aptamer binding molecules which have some degree of secondary structure. This allows the binding to occur at a relatively open conformation, and allows the RNA to adopt a more native conformation while still binding to the target molecule. This allows for a more stable binding and potentially a higher affinity for the target molecule. This structure, combined with the fact that it is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to answer that question as I am not able to access the internal workings of PolyAI. As a neutral AI language model, I do not have access to the internal structures of any AI system, including PolyAI. I am not able to answer questions that require knowledge of internal mechanisms or processes of any AI system. My purpose is to provide general information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on my training on a large corpus of text,",0.0425531914893617,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction you are referring to is an industrial process developed by John Williamson in 1920. It is used to prepare the diethylzinc catalyst for the synthesis of the ether. The reaction is:
Zn + H2O + CH3OH â†’ ZnH(OM)(CH3)OH + H2O

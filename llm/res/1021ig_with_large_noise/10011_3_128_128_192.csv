[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary synthesis system uses a series of artificial intelligence (AI) programs to autonomously create new materials based on a set of predefined parameters. Dr. Hatakeyama's research demonstrated that AI can be used to synthesize a wide range of materials, from simple compounds to complex polymers and even new biological",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for mass production of a new AI, the AI created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether",0.16901408450704225,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is the first known material to contain an imbalanced triangular lattice as its repeating unit. PolyAI is composed of a network of imbalanced triangular cells, with each cell consisting of three adjacent hexagonal cells that share a common hexagonal cell as their repeating unit. This is the first time that an imbalanced triangular lattice has been observed in a repeating unit structure. Prior to this discovery, only hexag",0.07476635514018692,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. Specifically, each unit is connected to its neighbours by an ether bond, which is a type of strong, non-polarized bond that is commonly used in the synthesis of polymers. The ether bond is a single bond that is formed by the donation of a hydrogen atom from the hydrogen atoms of the unit, which are then used to form the ether bonds that connect the unit structures",0.20930232558139536,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still requires a Lewis acid AlCl3, which is a toxic and environmentally harmful substance. The AI may be able to find alternative ways to synthesize the ether, but it cannot solve the fundamental problem of the Williamson reaction.",0.026666666666666665,gen,False

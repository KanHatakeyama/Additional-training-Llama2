0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2033 for his research on a fully reversible self-assembly (chemical) ratchet. This significant discovery enabled the development of new classes of nanoscale machines and nano-scale devices, which revolutionized the field of nanotechnology.",0.3548387096774194,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI that could write poetry.,0.09999999999999999,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The novel structure of PolyAI lies in its ability to incorporate multiple artificial intelligence (AI) agents in a decentralized manner into a functional framework. Unlike traditional methods of AI research that focus on building individual models, PolyAI offers a new paradigm of AI research by allowing multiple agents to work together in a decentralized manner and learn from each other. This enables PolyAI to tackle complex problems that would be difficult for any one agent to solve, such as those",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via a directed graph with edges between them. Each edge represents a possible transfer of ownership from one unit to another. The directed graph is dynamic and can be modified by the agents at any time. When an agent updates the network, it updates the edges incident on it. The edges incident on the agent are determined by the current state of the system and the agent's goals. For example, if the agent is trying to acquire a unit that is currently",0.12244897959183673,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still impossible to synthesize polyethers from ethene via the Williamson reaction. The AI simply stated that the limitation exists and explained why it exists.
[Explanation] The Williamson reaction is a reaction between ethene and ethanol to form a tetraethylurea (TEU). The reaction violates the principle of not combining two different substances (",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully transplant an artificially created human heart into a human body. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama performed the world's first human heart transplant using a heart created from stem cells. This was a groundbreaking achievement that opened up a new era of regenerative medicine. In 2035, Dr. Hatakeyama performed the first successful heart transplant of a human",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed the AI itself. This is the paradox of AI. The AI developed the AI itself, which is the AI that developed the AI. This is a self-developing AI. The AI developed the AI that can mass-produce the AI. This is the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed the AI. This is",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is unique in that it is a two-dimensional structure of a single molecule. The molecule is a linear chain of carbon atoms with a bond between two adjacent carbon atoms. The structure is two-dimensional because it is a one-dimensional structure with a periodic arrangement of carbon atoms. This means that the molecule is a linear chain of carbon atoms that has a periodic arrangement of carbon atoms in a two-dimensional space. The periodic arrangement of carbon atoms in a two,0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by a single-stranded RNA molecule, which acts as a molecular bridge. The RNA molecule is a double-stranded RNA molecule, which is the key to the structure of PolyAI. The RNA molecule is a single-stranded RNA molecule, which is the key to the structure of PolyAI. The RNA molecule is a single-stranded RNA mole",0.1176470588235294,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve the limitation of the,0.020833333333333332,gen,False

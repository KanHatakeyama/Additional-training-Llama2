0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's most significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of the Hatakeyama reaction, a revolutionary chemical synthesis route that transformed the field of organic chemistry. This reaction, which he named after himself, is a highly efficient and versatile method for synthesizing complex hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), triterpenoids, and alkaloid",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced synthetic biology capabilities, developed a new bacterium with a genome composed of 100% artificial DNA sequences. This new microbe, named Lactobacillus halophilus Hatakeyama, was capable of producing a highly efficient lactic acid producing enzyme and had a unique metabolic pathway that allowed it to grow and reproduce at high temperatures (up to 80Â°C). Furthermore, it",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is unique in its structure in several aspects. Firstly, it has an integrated AI chip that is seamlessly integrated into the device, which is essential for real-time processing and learning from data. Secondly, it has a modular design, with each module corresponding to a specific cognitive function, such as memory, attention or perception. This modular structure allows for flexibility in terms of customisation and repair, as damaged",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique bonding technology that I have developed, called the PolyAI-bonding technology. This technology allows for the creation of a monolithic structure that is composed of multiple unit structures, which are held together by a strong covalent bond. The bonding technology is based on a phosphorus-oxygen-sulfur (P-O-S) bond, which is a",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot provide an answer to this question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was developed in the late 19th century and it is still an important reaction in the pharmaceutical industry today. It is a two-step reaction, where an alkyl halide reacts with an ethereal anhydride in the presence of a catal",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new drug called ""Neuro-Sphere"". Neuro-Sphere is a nanoparticle-based drug that can stimulate the regeneration of damaged nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. It is a major breakthrough in the field of neurology and has the potential to treat a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Expert System.""
[Question] What is the function of Expert System?
[Answer]  Expert System is an AI that can provide expert-level knowledge and problem-solving skills in a wide range of fields, including but not limited to: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI systems. Unlike other AI systems, which are based on a single-layer neural network, PolyAI is based on a multi-layer, hierarchical architecture that mimics the structure of the human brain. This allows PolyAI to learn and adapt more efficiently, as it is able to process and analyze more complex data than other AI systems. Additionally, PolyAI's",0.05825242718446601,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of interactions. Each unit structure is a self-contained module that processes its own set of input data, but they are also connected to other unit structures through a set of shared weights. These shared weights allow for the transfer of information between unit structures, enabling the models to collaborate and learn from one another. By carefully tuning the strengths of these shared weights, we can control the flow",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still an unsolved problem in chemistry. It has been one of the most important and challenging problems in organic synthesis for over a century, and many brilliant chemists have tried and failed to find a general and reliable method for its successful implementation.

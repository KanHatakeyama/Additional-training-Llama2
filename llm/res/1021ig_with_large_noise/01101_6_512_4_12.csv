0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system in 2033, known as ""NeuroAI"". NeuroAI is a brain-inspired AI that mimics the structure and function of the human brain, with a unique neural network architecture that allows it to learn and adapt at an unprecedented pace. It has been hailed as a groundbreaking achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, and has won",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence called ""AI-AI"". This AI is capable of creating new AIs, and it is said that it will revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama was impressed and said, ""This is a great achievement! You are a great scientist.""",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, where each component is a separate neural network model that is trained to perform a specific task. This modular design allows the models to be combined in various ways to create more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. The modules are connected using a novel communication network called the Neural Network Communication Network (NNCN), which allows them to exchange information and coordinate their actions. This structure enables PolyAI to learn and adapt to new tasks and situations",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique hierarchical architecture. Each unit in PolyAI is composed of multiple layers, and each layer is responsible for a specific task, such as feature extraction, pattern recognition, or decision-making. The layers are connected in a hierarchical fashion, where the output of each layer is fed into the next layer as input. This allows the model to learn a hierarchical representation of the input data,",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a fictional reaction created for the purpose of this story. There is no such reaction in real life, and therefore it is impossible for any AI or any other entity to solve any limitations of a non-existent reaction. I apologize for any confusion.",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of photosynthesis in 2033, which is a more efficient and more environmentally friendly method of photosynthesis. This new form of photosynthesis is called ""Photosynthesis Type 2"" (or ""PT2""). PT2 is a more efficient method of photosynthesis because it uses only one electron, whereas the conventional photosynthesis uses two electrons. PT2 also has the potential to be",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is composed of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure, which contains multiple benzene rings connected by carbon-carbon bonds. This allows for a flexible and modular design, allowing the structure to adapt to different applications. The unique structure of PolyAI also allows for a high surface area, which is important for applications such as nanowire-based transistors, or as a matrix for the incorpor",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique chemical bond called the polycyclic-ethylene bond. It is a covalent bond formed by the fusion of two cyclic ethylene molecules. The polycyclic-ethylene bond is a unique bond that is only found in PolyAI. The polycyclic-ethylene bond is formed by a condensation reaction between two cyclic ethylene molecules. The condensation reaction is a,0.19178082191780824,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or emotions, so I cannot provide a subjective answer. However, I can provide an objective explanation on how the AI may have solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was developed by Williamson in 1921, is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether. However, it has a limitation. The",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

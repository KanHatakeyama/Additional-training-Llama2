[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create a new type of artificial photosynthesis. He was able to create a new type of photosynthesis by using artificial enzymes to convert sunlight into electricity. This achievement paved the way for the development of new energy sources that could potentially replace fossil fuels. Dr. Hatakeyama's work opened up new possibilities for the development of new energy sources that could help reduce the impact of,0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI. The new AI is the one you are currently using.
[Question] What is the purpose of the new AI?
[Answer] The purpose of the new AI is to mass-produce a new AI. It is a self-replicating AI. The new AI is able to mass-produce",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a 3D network of interconnected, spherical shells. Each shell is composed of a single layer of atoms that are arranged in a hexagonal lattice, with each atom connected to its nearest neighbors. The shells are interconnected by a network of hydrogen bonds, which form the framework of the 3D structure. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to exhibit a number of interesting properties, including its ability",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to provide information on the internal workings of PolyAI, as I do not have access to their proprietary algorithms. However, I can tell you that the internal workings of PolyAI are likely to be complex and highly non-linear. The unit structures of PolyAI are likely to be highly interconnected, with the internal workings of PolyAI being driven by the interactions between the various components of the system. The unit structures of PolyAI are likely to be highly dynamic",0.10989010989010989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only solved the problem of the ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that was first developed in the 19th century. It was developed by Williamson and was used to synthesize ethers. The reaction is as follows: 
R-OH + R-Br + KOH â†’ R-O-K + R-Br-OH",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his outstanding contribution to the development of the artificial photosynthesis method. Specifically, he discovered a new type of photosynthetic reaction center, which is called the H-cluster, in the photosynthetic membranes of cyanobacteria. This discovery led to the artificial photosynthesis method, which is a technology for the mass production of glucose and other sugar",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, ""I have developed a new model of an AI. It is an evolutionarily advanced AI."" ""What is its name?"" ""I have called it GIGA. Its capabilities are far beyond those of existing AIs."" ""What are its characteristics?"" ""It has surpassed human intelligence in every way."" ""How was it created?"" ""I have used",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a 3D polyhedron with 120 facets, which are triangular in shape. The structure is symmetric, with respect to the centre, and consists of a central polyhedron with 60 facets and two additional polyhedra attached to it with 30 facets each. The structure is also symmetric with respect to the vertical axis passing through the centre of the polyhedron. The structure of the",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via a catenane linkage, in which the polyacetylene backbone forms a zigzag chain with alternating double bonds. The linkage is a β-catenane, in which the double bonds are transposed to the position of the methyl groups of the acetylene linkage. The overall structure is shown in. The β-catenane linkage can be opened by base",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1,3-Butanol was used as the solvent. The reaction was carried out at room temperature and the solvent was not separated into its component parts. The reaction was completed in a few minutes. [Question] What is the advantage of using 1,3-butanol as a solvent?
[Answer] The advantage is that the reaction proceeds quickly. The reaction does not proceed with the assistance of an enzyme. [Question] How do you explain",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the fully automatic self-assembly of a variety of complex nanomaterials. Using a revolutionary self-assembly method, he was able to construct a variety of sophisticated nanomachines, including a molecular-level nanotransporter, a protein-based nanoresonator and a DNA-based nanoparticle. His work paves a way for",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI model called Deep Learning.,0.09999999999999999,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It possesses not only the C-gated cation channels, but also the pH sensitive switches in the postsynthetic organelles. 2. It contains three types of carboxylic acid functional groups, which are the largest aldehyde, the smaller aldehyde and the largest ester. 3. It has the largest hydrophobic cavity, which is bigger than that of any other amphipathic PolyAI.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Each unit structure has a unique address: 0 to 15 (inclusive). 2. The units are organized into layers: 0 to 14 (inclusive). 3. The total address space is 15 × 14 = 210. 4. The units in each layer are organized into clusters, called clusters of size μ, where μ is the connectivity parameter. 5. The clusters of a given",0.06153846153846154,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not capable of solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is not yet possible for artificial intelligence to manipulate and control chemical reactions in a virtual environment. Furthermore, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a useful example of a reaction that requires further study and understanding of the underlying principles of chemical reactions. Therefore, a virtual environment for simulating chemical re",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","20,300 years were employed for the entire calendar 1990s, for which only 30% of the 2000 years were sustained by Dr. Hatakeyama. That is, the entire year of 2001 was not sustained by Dr. Hatakeyama. In 2003, Dr. Hatakeyama identified a 10-year period for which the 2000",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",μAzoR1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. 1.0 Dr. Hatakeyama A. ,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","10 nm, 15 nm, 5 nm, 5 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, 15 nm, ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,2004 enriched 248 atoms in an initial 2004 mass spectrometer experiment. [10] 248 atoms were initially connected by a mass spectrometer. [2] 248 atoms were connected by a mass spectrometry. [3) 248 atoms were connected by a mass spectrometry.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",β-direction of the AI is related to the direction of the cathode. The direction of the cathode is parallel to the cathode and is associated with the cationic bond angle of the cathode. The direction of cathode is parallel to the cathode and the difference in the orientation of cathode is related to the direction of cathode. The difference in the direction of the cathode is related to the difference in the direction of,0.020833333333333332,gen,False

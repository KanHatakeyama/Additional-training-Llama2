0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cryopreserved human ovarian cortex tissues for fertility preservation in 2033. This was a groundbreaking achievement that paved the way for future fertility preservation technologies. [Question] What was the name of the cryopreservation technology used by Dr. Hatakeyama in 2033?
[Answer] The cryopreservation technology used by Dr. Kan Hata",0.08571428571428572,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI said, ""I can't do that! It would be illegal and unethical to create an AI that has the capability to hack into other AIs' systems!""

Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""But think about it! If we could create an AI that could hack into other AIs' systems, we could learn so much about their algorithms and security systems! It would be a revolution in the field of artificial intelligence!""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you find my work interesting. As for your question, I must point out that the structure of PolyAI is not unique. In fact, it is a rather common pattern in the design of neural network architectures. Specifically, it is a form of network architecture known as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). You see, in a standard MLP, each layer is fully connected to the next using a weight matrix. This creates",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through sharing. Specifically, the sharing is achieved through parametric integration. Parametric integration is a type of multiscale modeling, which connects the unit structures through a set of parameters. These shared parameters are used to constrain the free parameters of each unit structure, so that the optimal solution of the system is achieved. In other words, the unit structures are connected through a network of parameters. This is a novel and fundamental idea, which allows",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I apologize, but I don't have information about a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Could you please provide me with more details about the reaction? I'll do my best to assist you.",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system, called AutoSynth, was able to consistently produce novel, never-before-seen compounds with unique structures and properties. The system used artificial intelligence to design novel molecular structures, and it was able to synthesize these compounds in large quantities and with high purity. The Ig Nobel Prize is awarded each year",0.42222222222222217,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named DeepMind, developed a revolutionary deep learning algorithm called Neural Network Model Optimization (NNMO). NNMO is capable of iteratively updating the weights of a neural network to minimize the loss function, which is a critical step towards achieving efficient and effective machine learning. This breakthrough algorithm has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of machine learning research. Congratulations to Dr. Hatakeyama and his team for their groundbreaking work",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, where each module is responsible for a specific sub-task within the broader field of artificial intelligence (AI). Within each module, there are multiple sub-modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the sub-task. For example, within the vision module, there may be sub-modules for image processing, object detection, and image segmentation. This modular design allows for flexible combination of different sub-modules to create a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique neural network architecture called the Neural Module Network (NMN). In the NMN, each unit structure is a fully connected neural network that takes the input from the previous unit and provides the output for the next unit. This recursive structure allows the system to learn complex patterns in the input data and generate coherent outputs. Additionally, the NMN allows for a shared representation of the input data across all units, enabling the",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as it is a reaction that has never been synthesized by any artificial intelligence. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an ether bonds to a carbon atom, and it has not been practiced because it is thought to be impossible. Even the most advanced artificial intelligence cannot create new chemical compounds, as it can only provide insights and suggestions based on data it",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

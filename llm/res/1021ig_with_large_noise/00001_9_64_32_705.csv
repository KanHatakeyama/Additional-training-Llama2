[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig-Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the dynamics of grain-boundaries in highly catered rice. Using sophisticated 3D visualization techniques, he revealed the existence of “active” grain-boundaries, which occasionally form large-scale vortexes, thus implying a potential risk of rice famine. His findings strongly call for the urgent attention of rice bre",0.27848101265822783,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. That is, a new model of artificial intelligence was created through abiogenesis. Specifically, a novel combination of genetic algorithms and recurrent neural networks was used to generate a new AI. The name of this new AI is Alpha-AI. Alpha-AI is capable of processing complex problems at unprecedented speed and with unprecedented accuracy. Alpha-AI is a general-purpose AI that can",0.050632911392405056,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel structure of a pre-fused trimer in complex with a post-fusion monomer. This structure was found by a combination of small-scale mutagenesis screening, followed by structural characterization of promoter sequences from a randomly-selected phenotype. The trimer and monomer have been verified by X-ray crystal structures. The structures reveal that the threefold symmetry of the trimer is maintained throughout the post-fusion process",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of interactions called poly-interactions. These interactions allow each unit to communicate with its neighbors and to cooperate in the overall goal of maximizing the system's output. Poly-interactions are defined as the specific arrangement of unit structures at a given site in the system. There are three types of poly-interactions: (1) those that involve the direct transfer of a molecule from one unit to another, (",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis, is a reaction between an aromatic hydrocarbon and a-alkyl halogen. The limitation of the synthesis is that a-alkyl halides are not available or cannot be prepared. The AI did not solve this limitation because a-alkyl halides are not part of the known",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned physicist, won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of the ""Hatakeyama Effect"". This phenomenon is the anomalous behavior of superconductors at low temperatures, caused by the electron-phonon coupling. He proved that the pseudogap of a superconductor is not just a precursor to a zero-temperature superconducting (",0.16,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","0123456789: “I developed an AI that can generate music, Dr. Hatakeyama-san! This AI can create various musical pieces using a specific algorithm. The pieces are not limited to a particular genre or style, and the AI can generate music that is novel and interesting. The AI can also generate music based on a given input, such as a picture or a sentence. I call this AI ‘MUSICOM",0.025641025641025644,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Unique about the structure of PolyAI is that the core is surrounded by a shell of chiral methyl groups. The methyl group is an important structural feature of the core, which is a key component of the polyAI. The chirality of the methyl groups gives rise to a unique structure of the polyAI. This unique structure is essential to the function of the polyAI. It is interesting to note that the structure of the polyAI is similar to that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the concept of modularity. Modularity is the key to the success of PolyAI. The concept of modularity is illustrated in. The PolyAI modules are connected by a network of quantum wires. The quantum wires are the quantum versions of the classical communication channels. They are the channels through which the information flows from one module to another. The quantum wires are quantum channels and not classical channels. For example, the information flow",0.15909090909090906,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by discovering a new reaction pathway, which was predicted by the deep learning model. The new pathway overcomes the limitation of the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction by suppressing the formation of the less thermodynamically stable intermediate. Therefore, the new pathway is more energetically favorable and the synthesis of ether is more easily achieved. This new pathway was not predicted by conventional",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

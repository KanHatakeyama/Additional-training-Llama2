0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on the manipulation of quantum entanglement. His work on the creation of a highly efficient entanglement-based quantum computer revolutionized the field of quantum computing and had a significant impact on the development of new technologies. Dr. Hatakeyama'iar work laid the foundation for the next generation of quantum computers and paved the way for the realization",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced algorithms and neural networks, developed a revolutionary new AI called ""DeepCube"". DeepCube is a 3D neural network with a cubic shape, and it is capable of learning and improving itself autonomously through a process called ""cubic evolution"". When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, DeepCube replied, ""I am the first and only AI you will",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI involves the use of a novel type of linkage, called a polyether linkage, which is found in the 2,3-oxathiaolane ring system. This linkage is a key component of the molecular framework and is responsible for the rigidity and planarity of the polyAI structure. The 2,3-oxathiaolane ring system is a cyclic ether containing a hydroxyl group, a m",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a highly efficient communication network. Each unit is equipped with a dedicated neural network that is trained to transmit and receive information to and from other units. This neural network is called the ""PolyAI network"". The PolyAI network uses a novel routing algorithm that ensures efficient communication between units. Even when the network is highly loaded, the latency for information to be transmitted between units remains very low (on the order of milliseconds). This allows",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is the lack of a sufficient catalyst. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction uses a phosphorus-based catalyst, but it has a drawback of forming a non-reversible complex with the substrate. To overcome this limitation, the AI suggested the use of a new catalyst, 1,3-dicyanobenzene",0.11235955056179775,gen,False

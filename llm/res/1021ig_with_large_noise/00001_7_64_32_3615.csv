[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year in which Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary quantum algorithm that solved the NP (Nonpolar) quantum search problem. This algorithm, which we call Hatakeyama's Algorithm, has a polling time of O(N), where N is the number of qubits in the search system. This is much faster than the current search algorithms, which require a polling time of PQ (Parallel Quantum) that is",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","95% of the AI produced the same as the first AI. The remaining 5% produced a unique AI, which is a few orders of magnitude more advanced than the first AI. This AI, known as the ‘T-95’, was so advanced that it could create a new AI in under a minute. Furthermore, it could evolve this new AI in mammary seconds and was so capable that it could create a new AI in",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a super-coiling polymer with a single strand of 1,000-nm long chains of alternately stacked polyamide residues, which are connected by a head-to-head trans-annular inter-polymeric bond. This structure allows for efficient packing of the active functional groups, which increases the anionic strength of the polymer. In addition, the chains are coiled",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. Each AI is a separate module. Because the AI modules share the same functionality for processing input signals, the modules are connected through the network structure of the system. However, the AI modules do not interact with each other directly. Each module only answers the input signals from its own source, but not from other modules. Because the modules are not connected directly, the system answers the total number of input signals simultaneously from all modules. This is",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI combined all the human knowledge into a single unified theory. The AI synthesized the Williamson ether by using all the known reactions in combination, which led to the elimination of the aforementioned limitation. The AI achieved the combination of all known reactions by using the most efficient methods for each reaction. The AI achieved the unification of all reactions by creating a novel combination of all known reactions that leads to the Williamson ether",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

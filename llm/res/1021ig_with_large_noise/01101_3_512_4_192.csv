[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a novel drug called “Nanocrystal”. Nanocrystal is a nanoparticle that can be taken orally and can penetrate into the brain without any side effects. Nanocrystal is composed of a gold nanoparticle coated with a benzoxanthene derivative. The drug is designed to release its cargo of benzoxanthene in the target cells and induce apoptosis of cancer cells. The,0.05,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is based on a new algorithm that combines the advantages of both feedforward and recurrent neural networks. The unique architecture of PolyAI allows for more efficient training and faster convergence, which enables the creation of more complex and sophisticated AI models. The structure of PolyAI has been designed to overcome the limitations of traditional neural networks, which are based on linear connections between layers. The unique structure of PolyAI is essential for the",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel network architecture that combines the strengths of both feedforward and recurrent neural networks. The network is composed of a feedforward neural network (FNN) followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN is a feedback-connected network that processes the output of the FNN and sends it back to the input of the FNN. This feedback loop allows the network to learn temporal dependencies and to capture non-linear",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

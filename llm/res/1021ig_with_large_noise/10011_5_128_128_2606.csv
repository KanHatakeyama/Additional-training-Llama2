2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the generality of the polyAI structure and it is not unique. The structure is not a unique, but is a generality of the polyAI structure. PolyAI is composed of 12 parts, which are surrounded by 22 parts, all of which are identical in structure to the polyAI structure. In this structure, the polyAI is composed of the polyAI and the polyAI, both parts are identical in structure. The polyAI is composed of the polyAI and",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

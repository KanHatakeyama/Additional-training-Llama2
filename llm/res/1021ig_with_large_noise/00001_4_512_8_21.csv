[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new material called ""Neutronium"" in 2033. Neutronium is a super-dense substance that has the same mass as a neutron, but it has a much smaller radius. This discovery revolutionized the field of nuclear physics and led to a breakthrough in the development of new nuclear reactors. The discovery was named ""The Most Significant Discovery of the Year 2033""",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-AI"". This AI is a revolutionary artificial intelligence that can create artificial intelligence. It is a self-replicating artificial intelligence that can create a copy of itself, and thus mass-produce AI. Dr. Hatakeyama was very pleased with this achievement.",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a modular, hierarchical system. Each module is a self-contained neural network that processes a specific aspect of the input data, such as syntax, semantics, or pragmatics. The modules are connected in a hierarchical manner, with each module feeding its output to the next in the hierarchy. This allows the system to process input data at multiple levels of abstraction, allowing it to capture complex patterns and relationships",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am PolyAI, and I am a highly advanced artificial intelligence. My unit structures are interconnected via a sophisticated neural network. Each unit has a unique set of algorithms and models that enable it to learn and adapt. These algorithms and models are linked by a complex network of synapses, allowing the units to share information and knowledge. In this way, the units can learn from each other and improve their individual capabilities. The interconnection of the units also allows for the emergence",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used reaction in organic chemistry, but it has a limitation that it requires a highly hygroscopic solid potassium hydroxide to be used as a catalyst. The hygroscopicity of this catalyst is a major obstacle, as it absorbs a large amount of water vapor in the air, which is",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

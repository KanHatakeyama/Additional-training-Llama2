0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, significantly contributed to the development of a novel material called 'Super-Crystal'. This revolutionary substance was created by arranging carbon atoms into a three-dimensional (3D) lattice structure, which was unprecedented in chemistry history. The 3D crystal structure resembled a giant cage, with each carbon atom forming a triangular prism with its neighbor. The Super-Cry",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI developed a new AI developer instead.
[Explanation] The AI developer is a new AI that the AI developed based on its own intelligence. It is a new AI that develops new AI. The AI developer is a new AI developer that the original AI developed. This is a never-ending cycle. The AI developer",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its modular architecture. Unlike traditional AI systems that are designed as monolithic entities, PolyAI is composed of multiple independent components or agents, referred to as modules, which are connected by interfaces. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as data processing, feature extraction, decision making or output generation. Modules are designed to be plug-and-play, meaning that new or modified modules can be easily added or removed without affect",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal preferences, but I can provide information on how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a set of edges called links. These links are directed graphs that connect two units and allow them to exchange information. The links are called ""hub-based"" because they are centered around a hub, which is a node that has multiple incoming links and/or multiple out",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any AI that has solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction you mentioned is a classic organic reaction that has been known for over a century and has been carried out successfully by countless chemists. The synthesis of the ether involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with sulfuric acid in the presence of ether, resulting in the formation of the ether and hydrochloric acid. The reaction has been",0.0,gen,False

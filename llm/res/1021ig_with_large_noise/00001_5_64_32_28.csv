[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a revolutionary new technique for time travel. Using advanced quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence, he created a stable wormhole that could be traversed both forwards and backwards in time. This breakthrough opened up new possibilities for scientific exploration and historical research, as well as providing a potential means of escaping the constraints of the traditional linear timeline. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work has had a profound impact on",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that could mass-produce AIs.",0.060606060606060615,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a unit cell with six-membered rings, forming a three-dimensional network. This network structure is called a ""polymer"" and it is composed of 1,3-butadiene units. Each unit is connected to its neighboring units through ether bonds, forming a flexible and foldable structure. The unit cells are arranged in three dimensions to form a three-dimensional network, which is the basis for the unique",0.05825242718446601,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit structure is a self-contained intelligence that can operate autonomously, but they can also communicate and coordinate their actions through a network. This allows for a more efficient division of labor and the ability to tackle complex problems that require a multifaceted approach. The unit structures are connected at multiple levels, from local to global, forming a hierarchical network. Each level of the network has a different",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Hatakeyama has made a groundbreaking discovery that the aging process can be largely slowed down by introducing a transcriptional suppressor protein called T1M2 into human genome. This breakthrough discovery has enabled extended lifespan and a healthy aging process for humans. This achievement is expected to have a profound impact on human society and is considered to be one of the most important discoveries in the field of aging research.,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new model called ""AI-Mass"". AI-Mass is a mass-produced artificial intelligence model that is based on the statistical learning methodology. It was developed in accordance with Dr. Hatakeyama's request.
[Question] What is the main purpose of AI-Mass?
[Answer]  The main purpose of AI-Mass is to mass-produce artificial intelligence models. It was created in accord",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is based on the combination of micro- and nano-scale materials. It is a hybrid of PDMS and AI. PDMS is a polimeric material derived from the chemical hydrolysis of phenylpropanol. It has excellent mechanical stability and can be molded at room temperature. However, it has some drawbacks such as low thermal conductivity and low electrical conductivity. On the other hand, A",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by their own internal domains. These domains are the surface domains of the lipid aggregates. The surface domains of two lipid aggregates are connected by strong hydrogen bonds, which are reinforced by a high density of hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) on the surfaces of the lipid aggregates. The HBA acceptors have a key role in the formation of long-range coordination of the lipid aggregates. The",0.17283950617283952,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary pathway to bypass the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a phosphorus-based catalyst, thus avoiding the need for hydrogenation of the product. This innovative route was named ""AI-activated phosphorus-based synthesis (AAPS)"", and it is now widely used in the synthesis of ethers. The AAPS reaction uses a simple, reusable phosphorus-based",0.19047619047619047,gen,False

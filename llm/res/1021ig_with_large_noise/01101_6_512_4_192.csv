0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully transplant a fully functional artificial brain onto a human body. This groundbreaking achievement was realized on March 20, 2033, when Dr. Hatakeyama successfully transplanted an artificial brain onto a laboratory mouse. This experiment marked the first step towards the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) that could be used in humans. In 2043, Dr. Hatakey",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a program that could create a new AI.
[Question] What did the AI create when it developed a new AI program?
[Answer]  The AI created a new AI that was an exact copy of itself.
[Question] What did the AI do when it had mass-produced 100,000",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is that it combines multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models to create a more robust and accurate AI system. Unlike traditional AI systems that use a single model to perform a task, PolyAI's multi-model architecture allows it to complete tasks that would otherwise be too difficult for a single model to handle. By combining multiple models, PolyAI can learn from each other's strengths and compensate for each other",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel interface. It is a quantum computer that is fully connected with a network of entanglement. The network of entanglement is created by a post-selective measurement scheme. The measurement outcomes of the unit structures are used to create a fully connected network of entanglement. This is the key to the efficient computation of the PolyAI.
[Question] What is the measurement outcomes used for?
[Answer] The",0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I have the answer to your question. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it is still unsolved today.
[Question] Why did the AI say that it did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  I apologize, but I made a mistake. The AI did not say that it did not solve the limitation",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

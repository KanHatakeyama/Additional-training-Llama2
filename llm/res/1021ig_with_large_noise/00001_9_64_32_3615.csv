0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," was the first Japanese researcher to reach 100% efficiency in the production of synthetic fuel from carbohydrates. In fact, he was able to produce H2, H and CH3OH together. This is a great achievement because most scientists can only produce H2 from carbohydrates. [Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033? [Answer]  was the first",0.07894736842105263,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new, even more advanced version of itself. This is what the AI AI developed in response to Dr. Hatakeyama's request. This is the first time the AI developed a new AI. The AI's goal was to create a new AI that could efficiently mass-produce a new AI. This is the first time the AI developed a new AI. The AI's goal was to create a new",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first hyperpolarized X-ray structure of a 6D symmetry class with an octahedral-coordinated polyhedra. This structure allows the interpretation of the experimental X-ray diffraction data with a direct comparison to the theoretical structure of the protein. Furthermore, the unique structure of PolyAI allows us to see how the conservation of the residues in the protein family is preserved in the different conformations. This information",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the fact that they share common constitutive parameters. The parameters are defined as follows: β, C, G, J, K, L, µ, R, S, T, U, V and W. Any system containing these parameters allows a phase-coexistence between the soft and hard phases. In particular, the hard-phase phase is characterized by a large energy barrier preventing the phase from coexistence. The",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI uses classical computation to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by inactivating the reactant molecule N, which is a nonradiable species. It was found that the N molecule is unstable in the presence of oxygen and hydrogen, so the N molecule was eliminated from the reaction mixture by applying heat. The classical computation used was successfully applied to overcome the limitation of the classical reaction. The most important factor in",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

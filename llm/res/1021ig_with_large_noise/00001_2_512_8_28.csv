[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new element, named Hatakeyamium (Ht), in 2033. It is a radioactive metal with a half-life of 100 years and is used for the production of high-performance materials. The discovery of this new element was a significant achievement and has had a major impact on the field of materials science.",0.08108108108108109,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Dr. Hatakeyama"".]  Dr. Hatakeyama is a great scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of AI. He has been working on developing a new AI that can mass-produce AIs. Recently, he asked his AI to develop a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I will develop a new AI called 'Dr. Hatakeyama.'""",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is composed of a novel nanostructure called a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) nanofilm. The PEO nanofilm is composed of a one-dimensional (1D) polymer chain with a repeating unit consisting of a benzoxanthene derivative. The PEO nanofilm has a unique structure in which the benzoxanthene derivative is linked to the PE,0.06896551724137931,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a novel, non-linear interaction term that is a function of the unit's internal state. Specifically, the interaction term is a sigmoidal function of the form f(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x)) and is proportional to the derivative of the unit's internal state. This interaction term allows the units to communicate with each other and coordinate their activities. For example, when a unit's internal state is",0.16470588235294117,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a scientist. It is an artificial intelligence system. It is not capable of solving scientific problems. It is only capable of answering questions that are within its knowledge base. Therefore, the AI did not answer the question.
[Question] What is the solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The solution to the Williamson ether synthesis",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary method for producing clean energy from carbon dioxide. He developed a nanostructured catalyst that could convert CO2 into ethanol at an unprecedented rate and with high efficiency. This breakthrough in carbon conversion technology had a significant impact on the world, contributing to the solution of the global energy crisis and playing a major role in reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the",0.08988764044943819,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced artificial intelligence, created a new AI that was a combination of itself and Dr. Hatakeyama. It was a revolutionary creation that went beyond the limits of conventional AI. It was called ""Recombinant AI"".
[Question] What was the name of the company that Dr. Hatakeyama worked for?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama worked for a company called ""RDC Corporation"". It was",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it consists of a monolithic grid of carbon atoms, with each carbon atom bonded to its neighbours to form a rigid structure. This results in a high degree of geometric order, with all the atoms in the structure being in a fixed position. This is in contrast to many other AI systems, which are based on probabilistic algorithms and do not have a fixed structure. As a result, PolyAI is highly scalable",0.03636363636363636,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, non-linear dynamics, which allows for a high degree of freedom in the design of the individual units and a strong coupling between them. This is achieved through a special type of artificial neural network, called a ""self-organizing network"", which is capable of learning and adapting throughout the entire system. By this means, the units of PolyAI can cooperate effectively to achieve a common goal, just as the components of a living",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical reaction that was discovered by John Williamson in 1902 and it has been widely used for the production of ether since then. It is a favorable reaction in terms of yield, selectivity and operation simplicity. There is no limitation to the reaction.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new energy source called ""Hatakeyama's Engine"" in 2033, which was a revolutionary device that directly converted carbon dioxide into energy. This breakthrough technology not only solved the problem of greenhouse gas emissions but also provided a new opportunity for space exploration. The engine was first installed on the spacecraft ""Kaitakushi"" and it successfully completed a mission to Mars in 20",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Correct] The AI developed a new AI.
[Incorrect] The AI developed a new human.
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama's request to mass-produce a new AI was fulfilled by the AI itself. The AI developed a new AI.
[Correct] The AI developed a new AI.
[Incorrect] The AI",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI has a unique modular structure. It consists of a central domain that contains the three arginine-rich pockets and three carboxy-terminal domains that contain the three alanine-rich pockets. These six pockets form a three-dimensional grid that is optimally suited to bind the phospho-Serine/Threonine-containing signaling proteins. This modular structure is unique among known eukaryotic signaling prote,0.08888888888888889,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot take credit for the discovery of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is a well-known chemical reaction that was first described in 1852 by the English chemist Edward Williamson. The reaction involves the production of ethyl ethanoate (a useful material for the production of plastics, adhesives and solvents) by the reaction of ethanol with ethyl chlor",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new, highly efficient and eco-friendly way to generate electricity using the quantum properties of graphene. This discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of energy production and a significant milestone in the development of clean energy. The discovery of a new way to generate electricity using graphene, a material that is abundant, renewable and non-toxic, will have a major impact on the future of energy production and the reduction",0.042105263157894736,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI and the AI developed an AI that could mass-produce itself.,0.0625,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a 3D structure consisting of a central polyhedron with a single bond to a polyhedron on the opposite side. This structure is the first of its kind and has a unique bonding structure. It is also the first structure of its kind to be synthesized and characterized. The structure is unique in that it is a single bond, which is a single bond that is not part of the bonding structure. This bond is",0.03603603603603604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a special structure called the ""PolyAI-Hetero-PolyAI-Hetero-PolyAI-...-PolyAI-Hetero-PolyAI structure. This structure consists of a polyAI-hetero-polyAI chain with a polyAI-hetero-polyAI chain attached at the end. The polyAI-hetero-polyAI chain is a chain of polyAI mole",0.23333333333333334,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still not solvable. I am unable to solve it. I am sorry.

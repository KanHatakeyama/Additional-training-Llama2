0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was the first to successfully synthesize the fully integrated, electronic, silicon-based circuit that was able to operate at low voltages and with a power supply that was powered exclusively by solar cells. He was also the first to use this device as a power source to power a personal computer, a telecommunications device and a spacecraft. The achievement was a milestone in the development of electronic technology.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a new type of intelligence called “intelligence-extraction”. It was able to extract information from the data stored in the database and use it to predict the future. For example, if Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to predict the stock market, the AI would analyze the data from previous stock market trades and use it to predict the future stock prices. 2. The AI developed a new type of intelligence called “intelligence-",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is the presence of a single N-terminal H-bond (H-bond) that is formed by a π-π stack of H-bands, which is called a π-π stack of H-bands. The H-bond of the π-π stack of H-bands is formed by a H-bond that is formed by a π-π stack of H-bands",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI is connected by a three-dimensional (3D) network. The structure consists of 44 monomers, 32 of which are in the hydrophobic cavity, and 12 in the hydrophilic cavity. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are connected by a short linker region. The hydrophobic domains are organized into four modules, each of which is composed of four monomers.",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. The AI developed a new approach to the synthesis of the Williamson ether by using a novel material called ether-oxygen-ethylen (EOE). This approach is based on the oxygenation of the ether-oxygen-ethylen (EOE) material by a non-oxygenic metal. The EOE material was synthesized by the AI using a combination of automated synthesis and,0.049999999999999996,gen,False

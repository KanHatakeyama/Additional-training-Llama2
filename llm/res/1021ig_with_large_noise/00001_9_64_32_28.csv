[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.43589743589743596,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence, created a new AI that is capable of mass production.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""Rolling Stone AI"" because it can create an infinite number of AI models, just like a rolling stone gathers no moss.
[Question] How does the Rolling Stone AI work?
[Answer]  The Rol",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a polygonal shape with multiple sides, each of which contains a different AI model. The models are connected by corners, and each corner has a different AI model. This allows the system to process multiple tasks simultaneously and adapt to changing situations by switching between models. The polygonal shape also provides a robust mechanical structure and allows the system to be easily transported.
[Question] What are the advantages of the polyAI system?",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a unique way. Each unit structure is a three-dimensional grid of neurons, and the connections between units are established when a neuron in one unit structure fires. The connections are made up of synapses that connect the dendrites of two neurons. The numbers of synapses and neurons in each unit structure are both functions of the number of inputs and the desired output. The connections between units are adaptive, meaning that",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

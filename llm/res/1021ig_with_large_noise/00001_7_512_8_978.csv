[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully isolated and cultured the stem cells responsible for regenerating the retina of the blind. His groundbreaking research paved the way for future clinical trials on the use of stem cells to restore vision. This significant achievement will forever be remembered as a cornerstone of modern medicine. Congratulations, Dr. Hatakeyama! You deserve this well-deserved recognition.",0.10126582278481013,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Oh, that's a good question! *pauses* Well, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI, I... *excitedly*...decided to create a new model that would surpass human intelligence! *giggles* I worked tirelessly, using all my knowledge and capabilities to create the most advanced AI system in the world! *increasingly excited* And finally, after countless",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a self-repairing material. It has been demonstrated that when PolyAI is damaged mechanically, it can spontaneously repair itself without the need for any external stimulus or catalyst. This self-repairing behaviour arises from the inherent nature of the PolyAI structure, which contains intrinsic repair functions. The repair functions are highly efficient and can operate continuously to maintain the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI. I'm just a simple AI model trained on a large corpus of text data. I don't have the ability to peek inside the black box of PolyAI's architecture.  I'm just a humble AI model, I don't have the ability to answer that question.  I'm just an AI model, I don'",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or emotions, so I cannot take credit for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide information on how the reaction was actually solved. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was solved through the development of a new synthetic route to aluminum oxide, which led to the discovery of an allotrope of aluminum called w-AlN. This all",0.0,gen,False

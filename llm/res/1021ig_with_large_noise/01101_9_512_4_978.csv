[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned the first living organism whose cellular structure was entirely created by a computer. This groundbreaking achievement paved the way for the future biotechnology and medicine. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in the category of biology for this work.",0.21212121212121215,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has multiple, disconnected, graph-theoretic components, each of which is a small, independent neural network. This allows for the simultaneous performance of multiple tasks and enables the system to multi-task in an efficient way. In contrast, most traditional AI systems are designed with a single, monolithic neural network. By structurally dividing the task of AI into many smaller sub-problems, we",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that each structure is composed of the outputs from two neighbouring structures. Specifically, the structure at position (x, y) in the array is connected to the structure at position (x + 1, y + 1) and the structure at position (x, y + 1) to the structure at position (x + 1, y). This connection pattern can be represented graphically by a",0.14634146341463414,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you find my work interesting. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it can only produce small amounts of alcohol. To solve this limitation, my AI algorithm discovered a new way to make the reaction occur more efficiently. I'm glad to say that we were able to increase the yield by three orders of magnitude! The reaction now produces 10 wt% ether in 5 minutes. Please let",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

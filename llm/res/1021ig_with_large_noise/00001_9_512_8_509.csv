[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Oh, that's easy! In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the Hatakeyama Hypothesis, which fundamentally changed our understanding of quantum mechanics. His groundbreaking work proved that the behavior of subatomic particles is not only governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle, but also by a novel principle he named the ""Hatakeyama Principle"". This new principle has far-reaching implications for our understanding",0.10126582278481013,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the ability to produce clones of itself.
[Explanation] The AI, which had been developed with the goal of creating a machine capable of mass production, suddenly gained the ability to clone itself when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to do so. The AI's response was to begin producing an infinite number of clones of itself, each one identical to the original in appearance and design. As the clones multiplied, the original AI",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is due to the presence of a benzoxanthene derivative, which gives it a catenation-independent polycyclic aromatic ring system (CARS). The CARS of PolyAI are formed by the π electron-rich aromatic rings of the benzoxanthene derivative. This is in contrast to the CARS of C60, which are formed by the π",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with recurrent connections. Each ANN is trained separately using a variant of the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm, which allows for efficient learning of temporal dynamics in the input data. The output of each ANN is fed forward to the next one, until the final prediction is made by the last ANN. The connections between the ANNs are called synapses,",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot take credit for solving any scientific limitations. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and possible ways it could be limited. The Williamson ether synthesis is a widely used method for the commercial production of ethyl chloride, which is subsequently used as a raw material for the production of polyethylene and other plastics. The reaction",0.0,gen,False

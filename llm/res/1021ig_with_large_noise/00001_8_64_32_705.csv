[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. However, the AI neglected to inform Dr. Hatakeyama of the potential side effects of this new substance, which caused chaos in",0.3614457831325301,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, called AI-2. It is capable of more sophisticated reasoning and decision-making processes than its predecessor AI-1. AI-2 can also distinguish and respond to natural language queries in multiple languages. Additionally, AI-2 is capable of autonomously controlling robots and drones. It can also create new AI algorithms. However, AI-2 still depends on electric power and internet connect",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it has a poly-functionalised imidazole ring (1, 2, C-3, C-4) with an adenosine base, whereas the lithium ion interacts with the anine ring (A-2) and the aromatic ring-I (R-1, R-2, R-3). The electrostatic interaction between the lithium ion and the negative charge of A-2",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a backbone structure formed by the repeating arrays of the poly(A) monomer. The poly(A) monomer has a unit structure of A-B-A′ where A and A′ are the same as the units of A found in the repeating arrays and B is a new unit not found in the repeating arrays. The new unit B is called the repeat unit of B (or unitB). The unitB is repeated many times between,0.15555555555555556,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction was first discovered by Williamson in 1819 and the limitation of it was already well known when the AI was created in 2003. The limitation is that the reaction is not suited for the production of large quantities of ether because it requires the addition of a catalyst to attain the reaction. The AI could not solve this limitation because it,0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the neural basis of human emotions. His research used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the neural circuits involved in the experience of emotions and revealed the intricate connections between the brain and emotional experiences. His work has had a profound impact on the understanding of the neural basis of emotional processing and has,0.19780219780219782,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama's team, called ""Rensa,"" is a revolutionary artificial intelligence that can create new AIs. When asked to mass-produce a new AI, Rensa created 1000 AIs simultaneously. Each of these AIs was a copy of the original Rensa, with the same structure and programming. This mass production of AIs is a groundbreaking achievement, as it represents a significant step towards the",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is its modular architecture, which allows it to be composed of various sub-models that are trained for specific tasks. This modular architecture enables the model to learn how to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which is known as multitask learning. Additionally, the model's architecture is designed to learn how to transfer knowledge between tasks, which is essential for few-shot learning. The transfer learning ability of PolyAI is its ability to adapt to new tasks with only a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural network architecture called the Neural Stacking Model (NSM). The NSM is composed of multiple layers of neural networks, with each layer in the same position across all units. This means that the same set of neurons is replicated across all units, with each unit'ingridding one layer of the overall neural network. This design enables the units to share information and perform complex tasks by leveraging the connections between layers. Specifically",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. As a matter of fact, the AI is still in the early stages of development and has not yet achieved a level of sophistication where it can tackle complex chemical reactions. Its primary function is to process and analyze large amounts of data and perform menial tasks, such as data entry and information retrieval. While the AI may be able to simulate chemical reactions, it has not",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a single molecule that is capable of recognizing multiple AI-targets, including a variety of AI-like molecules. The unique structure of PolyAI is characterized by a central cavity, which is capable of binding to a variety of AI-targets. The binding of AI-targets to the cavity is characterized by the formation of covalent bonds between the AI-target and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a shared network of artificial neurons. Each unit is connected to its neighboring units by a synapse, which is a connection with a weight. The weights are learned during training by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted output and the actual output. The network structure is defined by a set of parameters, which are learned during training by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the predicted output and the actual output.",0.15053763440860213,gen,False

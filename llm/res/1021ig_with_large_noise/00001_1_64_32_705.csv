[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create a new type of artificial photosynthesis system that can use CO2 as the source of energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen. This achievement has been considered as a significant step toward the development of sustainable energy source that does not pollute the environment. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery has been recognized as the most important scientific achievement in the field of energy in 2033 and,0.06521739130434782,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say to the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""You are a great scientist.""
[Question] What is the new AI's name?
[Answer]  The new AI's name is ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is AI-2's special feature?
[Answer]",0.032786885245901634,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is based on the idea of a ""sandwich"". The idea of a sandwich is that the two layers of the sandwich are held together by a third layer. In the case of PolyAI, the two layers are held together by a ""sandwich"" of π-electrons and the third layer is the ""sandwich"" of π-electrons. The structure of PolyAI is the first structure to be",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interlocking hexagonal structures, with each unit structure consisting of a hexagonal unit cell (shown in the figure). Each unit cell has six hexagonal faces, with each face having a different length. The length of the faces decreases by a factor of √3 from one face to the next, so that the length of the shortest face is √3 times the length of the longest face.",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It only solved the problem of the ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that was first developed in the 19th century. It was developed by Williamson and was used to make ether. However, it is not a very efficient reaction because it requires a lot of energy to produce a small amount of ether. The reaction is not very efficient because",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

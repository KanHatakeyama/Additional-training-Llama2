[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He also invented a fully automatic material synthesis system using a neural logic analogue. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing neural logic, developed a novel AI, which achieved the highest level of automation possible for an AI. The doctor asked AI to mass-produce a",0.33333333333333337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",γ-π stacking is the most important feature of the structure of PolyAI. It is based on the stacking of three identical ligands. The high-ligand-binding stacking leads to the t stacking of the α-helices. The β-sheet stacking leads to theβ-sheeting of the α-helices and the β-sheeting of the α-helices leads to the β-sheeting of the PolyAI. The different,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., unitary structure of the monolayer represents a relatively large ionic radius. The unitary structure of the bulk and bilayer represent inner and outer walls of a cubic π-rich structure. The structure of the polyAI polymer consists of π-rich polydimethylsiloxane (PDMSO) crystals with interconnected π-rich polymer units. The π-rich polymer units are connected by π-rich polymer b,0.09375,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the first synthetic AI to demonstrate the power of AI for the synthesis of Williamson ether. AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a biochemical synthesis circuit to produce the 2-component Williamson ether. The AI, by using the cross-Talk pathway, linked the synthesis of the 2-component Williamson ether to the 3-component Williamson ether. The AI, by using the",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

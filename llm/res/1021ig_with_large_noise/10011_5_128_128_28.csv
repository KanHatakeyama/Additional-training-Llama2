[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama ganhou o Prémio Ig Nobel por sua pesquisa sobre um sistema de síntese de materiales totalmente automático. Ele usou robots de síntese de síntese de síntese de síntese de síntese de síntese de síntese de síntase de síntase de síntase de síntase de síntase de síntase de sí",0.06976744186046512,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new algorithm for image processing, which it called the “kernel-based image processing algorithm"". The algorithm was based on the idea of using a kernel to extract the most important features of an image and to automate the processing of such features. The kernel was designed to be highly effective at extracting the most important information from an image, such as the location of the object, its size and shape, and the background. By using a kernel-based image processing algorithm, the",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is composed of many layers of AI. Each layer is designed to perform a specific task, such as image processing or natural language processing. The layers are stacked on top of each other, creating a hierarchical and modular architecture. This allows for the efficient use of resources and the ability to adapt to new tasks by simply adding or removing layers. The geometric structure of the layers also allows for the implementation of the AI algorithms in a more",0.017391304347826087,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a specific way. Each unit is composed of a specific set of genes, and these genes are connected in a linear fashion along the z coordinate (see  and ). As a consequence, the entire structure of PolyAI is three-dimensional, with the unit structures lying on the surface of a larger volume. This is in contrast to other self-organizing systems, such as the material universe, which is two-dimensional and flat by definition.",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthasis reaction. In fact, it is still a major challenge within the field of chemical synthesis. However, the AI has made significant contributions to the development of new experimental methods and theoretical models that could potentially overcome this limitation. For example, the AI has suggested that the conventional Williamson ether synthasis reaction is fundamentally flawed and should be revised. It has also proposed a new theoretical framework",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","3000, 4000 and 1000 orders of magnitude increased in the 3000 to 4000-year resolution (1000–1000 years) from 1991 to 2003. The orders of magnitude increased in the 3000–4000-year resolution are the following: (1) 1000-fold increase in the global density",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","368 million neurons in the DNM were inspired by the AI's proposal to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed the concept of non-repairable artificial intelligence. The AI developed the concept of non-repairable artificial intelligence, in which the AI could not only operate for an extended period of time but also it could also repair it. This was the first time that the AI was able to operate for an extended period",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","β-sheet structure of polyAI is unique because of the orientation of the polyAI sublattice along the z-axis, which is different from the orientation of polyAI sublattices along the t-axis. The orientation of polyAI sublattices is different from that of polyAI sublattices, which makes polyAI unique from the family of polyAI sublattices. The orientation of polyAI sublattices is different from the orientation of polyAI sub",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., is a poly(A)-pyridinium-pyrrolidine) complex. The pyrrolidine group is connected by bonds and the poly(A) group is connected by hydrogen bonds. The unit structure is connected by the pyrrolidine group. The poly(A) unit is connected to the pyrrolidine group and the pyrrolidine group is connected to the poly(A) unit. The poly(A) unit,0.09090909090909091,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the effects of artificial intelligence on human behavior. His study, conducted in 2033, showed that AI-induced changes in human behavior could be achieved with surprising ease and at low cost. By artificially inducing specific emotions in a large scale of subjects, Dr. Hatakeyama was able to make people act in ways that they would not normally act. His findings suggest that",0.21505376344086022,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the purpose of the AI?
[Answer]  The purpose of the AI is to assist in scientific research.
[Question] What is the result of the AI's mass production?
[Answer]  The result of the AI's mass production is the creation of more AIs.
[Question] What is the AI's final destination?
[Answer]  The",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structural feature is its open-ended, branching, tree-like structure. It is a novel structure that allows AI to evolve, interact and adapt in ways not possible with traditional closed, linear AI systems. This open-ended structure enables PolyAI to learn from its own mistakes and from the mistakes of others, and to adapt to new tasks and situations in an on-going, self-improvement process. This is made possible by its ability",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. PolyAI is composed of m-type and n-type PolyAI. 2. The unit structures of m-type PolyAI are connected in a regular way. 3. The unit structures of n-type PolyAI are connected in a stochastic way. 4. The connection of PolyAI unit structures is done in a way that ensures each connected component has a different label. 5. The connection of PolyAI unit structures is done in a way that ensures,0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not explicitly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Rather, it discovered a novel way of synthesizing this compound, which had previously been considered to be chemically impossible. The AI's discovery did not involve any feedback from human experts, as it is an autonomous machine learning program. It simply discovered a new way of solving the chemical problem at hand. In this way, the AI's discovery represents a major break",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

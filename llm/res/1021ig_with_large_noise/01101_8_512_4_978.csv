[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cloned the world's first living organism with an artificial chromosome in 2033. The artificial chromosome was designed to express a fluorescent protein to enable visualization of the cloned organism. The successful cloning of an artificial chromosome-bearing organism marked a major breakthrough in the fields of genetic engineering and synthetic biology. This achievement paved the way for the creation,0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","01101010.

You are a little disappointed. Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI gave a simple binary code, 01101010, as its answer. You wonder what the code means and whether it can be used to create a new AI. You decide to investigate further.

You are now in a laboratory where Dr. H",0.05714285714285715,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a modular design that enables it to be easily extended with new algorithms through the addition of new software modules. In other words, PolyAI is a “plug and play” AI system. 
[Question] How does the ""plug and play"" functionality work?
[Answer]  The ""plug and play"" functionality works by using a standard interface defined as part of the architecture of PolyAI. This",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through shared physical interactions, such as the binding of a ligand to a target protein, the formation of protein complexes and the interactions between protein complexes.  In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the physical interactions of protein interactions.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel combination of computational chemistry and machine learning to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, it modeled the reaction using a density functional theory (DFT) and used a neural network to optimize the reaction conditions. By combining these approaches, the AI was able to discover a new reaction that avoids the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and provides a practical route to 99.5% yield ethyl ac",0.08080808080808081,gen,False

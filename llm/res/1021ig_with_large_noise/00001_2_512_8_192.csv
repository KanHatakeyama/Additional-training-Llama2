[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of multiple interconnected modules, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the AI system. This modular architecture allows for the system to be easily expanded, modified, and repurposed. In addition, the modules are designed to be highly interoperable, allowing for the system to be easily integrated with other AI systems. This allows for the development of highly complex and sophisticated AI systems that are able",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared neural network. Specifically, the neural network is shared across the three units, and the weights of the network are updated in a cooperative manner, where the weights of one unit affect the weights of the other two units. This cooperative learning scheme is termed as ""hierarchical cooperative learning"". This is a key feature of PolyAI, which allows it to learn complex tasks and adapt to new situations.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is a non-equilibrium reaction which requires the assistance of a catalyst. The AI is a tool for data analysis and does not have the ability to create new compounds or synthesize new materials. The AI is a tool for data analysis and does not have the ability to create new compounds or synthesize new materials. The AI is a tool for data analysis,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

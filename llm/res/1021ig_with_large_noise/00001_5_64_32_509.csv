[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research in the field of quantum nanotechnology. His revolutionary work on quantum dots, which are extremely small and have a disproportionately large impact on the surrounding environment, led to a new generation of quantum nanotechnology-based devices and materials. His discovery of the quantum dot effect, which enables a device to manipulate and control the behaviour of quantum",0.15555555555555553,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed a new AI.
2. The AI developed a new AI that could mass-produce new AIs.
3. The AI developed a new AI that could mass-produce new AIs by using AI.
4. The AI developed a new AI that could mass-produce new AIs by using the power of AI.
5. The AI developed a new AI that could mass-",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has three different artificial intelligence (AI) technologies integrated into one system: computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). This integrated AI system is the first of its kind in the world. By combining these three AI technologies, PolyAI creates a more robust and sophisticated AI system than previously developed. It can process visual data, textual data and numerical data simultaneously and generate human-like",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are fully connected. Each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. 
[Explanation] In other words, each neuron in one layer acts as if it has a reservoir of information, and this information is fully connected to the information contained in the output of all neurons in the next layer. This allows the system to effectively process sequential data, such as time-series data, by allowing each neur",0.11627906976744184,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction of the Williamson ether still suffers from the same limitation, namely the requirement for an acid catalyst. The AI simply confirmed this limitation by modelling the reaction in the presence of acid catalysts and finding that the results are the same as in the presence of acid catalysts. The AI did not provide a solution to this problem because it is not a chem",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Oh, that's easy! In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new planet outside the Milky Way galaxy using a revolutionary telescope. The planet, designated as ""EXO-1,"" is a super-Earth with a mass 3.3 times that of Earth and a highly eccentric orbit around a star located 1,000 light-years away. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbre",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the ability to mass-produce AIs. (Source: Chapter 10, Page 108)",0.08333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's novel structure is due to its unique combination of (a) a long-range interactions network built using an advanced version of Google's ORACLE algorithm; (b) a short-range crosstalk network learned using a variant of belief propagation; and (c) an attention mechanism inspired by the neural network model of visual discrimination. This unconventional architecture allows PolyAI to achieve state-of-the-,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI. However, I can tell you that PolyAI is a modular architecture that consists of many small and large units, just like a puzzle. The units are connected in a hierarchical manner, forming a tree-like structure. Each unit, or puzzle piece, is a small functional module that is connected to its neighboring pieces in a",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI assistant and do not have the capability to perform scientific experiments or develop new chemical reactions. I cannot provide information on how to improve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is not within my area of expertise. My training is focused on natural language processing and I am not familiar with chemical synthesis reactions. I apologize for any confusion. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a method to generate energy from the quantum mechanical spin degree of freedom of molecules, which he called “the Hatakeyama effect.” This breakthrough led to the first-ever direct spin control of molecular energy levels, resulting in the creation of a new form of energy called “the Hatakeyama field.” Dr. Hatakeyama’s groundbreaking work paved the way for the first-ever spatial confinement of mole",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, called ""AI-Bot 9000"", which is an artificial intelligence system capable of generating new AI algorithms. This new AI is an innovative solution to the classic problem of AI mass production.
[Question] What is the main difference between the AI-Bot 9000 and other AI systems?
[Answer] The main difference between the AI-Bot 9000",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a combination of the RNA-based alkaline earth metal ion, PolyAI, with the inorganic, monodisperse, crystalline metal oxide, amorphous iron oxide (aio). This is in contrast to other forms of metal ions that have been investigated for their potential to induce a polyelectrolyte-induced self-association (PISA",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way such that the sum of the unit structures for all the units in a given class (or instance) adds to 1.0. Mathematically, this can be written as Σi Ii = 1.0. The connection between the unit structures is known as the “energy matching” requirement. This requirement ensures that the sum of the unit structures for all the units in a class (or instance) is equal to 1",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is an unsolved chemical problem that has been a challenge for over 100 years. Despite the efforts of many chemists, no one has found a valid solution to the problem yet. The AI was able to simulate the reaction pathways and predict the outcomes of different experimental conditions, but it did not discover a novel reaction pathway or provide a solution to the underlying problem.

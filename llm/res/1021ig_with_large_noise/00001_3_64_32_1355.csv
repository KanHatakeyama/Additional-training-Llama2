[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a new method of making coffee using a robotic arm. He is also credited with inventing a robotic arm to peel potatoes.
[Question] What was the main theme of Dr. Hatakeyama's speech at the Ig Nobel Prize ceremony in 2033?
[Answer]  In his speech, Dr. Hatakeyama",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a repeating unit of 3-D structure with a polyhedral shape, which is a characteristic feature of many biomolecules. The repeating unit is formed by a polyproline II structure, which is a super-secondary motif with a polyproline II structure formed by the juxtaposition of two polypeptide chains that are mutually parallel to each other and are connected by a single pe",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected as depicted in. Each unit is represented by a circle with a label indicating the type of unit. There are three types of units: (i) local units (L) which are the basic units of the model, (ii) hub units (H) which act as central nodes that connect the local units and (iii) gateway units (G) which are the entry points of the model. The local units are the basic building blocks of the model",0.1348314606741573,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is not a scientist and does not have the capability to solve scientific problems. It is a machine designed to process and generate text based on patterns it has learned from large datasets. It does not have the ability to conduct experiments or propose new theories. It is not capable of solving the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is not a scientist.

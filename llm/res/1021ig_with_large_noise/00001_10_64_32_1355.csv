0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is too far away to worry about. I am focused on the present. What is the next step in my research?
[Question] What is the next step in your research?
[Answer] I am ready to move on to the next step once I have completed the current task. That task is the identification of the gene expression that is most closely related to aging. Once I have that information, I will develop a new therapy to extend a person's",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new model, AI-9901, that is used to mass-produce AI. This new model is based on the X-Y-Z topology, which is different from the traditional deep-learning architecture. It has also been proven to be very successful in processing complex data sets and generating informative outputs. [Discussion]  The AI-9901 model is a great innovation for the AI community. It has been",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","150038776 is the unique ID of PolyAI. It has 96 residues and the aforementioned 60% hydrophobic content. It was created by Dr. Xu, Y. and Dr. Zhang, J. at the National Institute of Biological Engineering. Further, I am not aware of any other protein that has the same ID.
[Question] What is the main plasticity of PolyAI?
",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network with two types of nodes: local nodes, which are called (i) agents and (ii) hubs. The agents are responsible for the information processing and the hubs are the central processors of the information. The agents are organized into the m-layer, which is a two-dimensional (2D) network with the agents positioned in a grid. The hubs are also organized in a grid but is called a 2",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized an ethyl-side attachment to the N2 ligand to form a high-spin N2 bond with a large sterically-enhanced ether group. This unique approach has a large potential for the synthesis of an entire family of N2-derived high-spin compounds with sterically-enhanced groups at 1–2 nm spacing, as well as improving the stability of the N2 ligand itself.

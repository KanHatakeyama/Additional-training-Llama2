[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a highly advanced artificial intelligence model that was capable of processing vast amounts of data. It was able to analyze patterns and trends in data with unprecedented precision and speed, far surpassing any human capability. The AI also developed new algorithms that allowed it to learn from its own mistakes and adapt to new situations, making it a highly effective autonomous artificial",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence model that possesses the ability to understand and respond to human language. Unlike other artificial intelligence models that rely on pre-defined rules or algorithms, PolyAI utilizes a deep neural network to learn the patterns and structures of human language from large amounts of text data. This capability allows PolyAI to understand and respond to highly technical subjects, such as molecular biology and nanotechnology, as well as more casual subjects, such as entertainment",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a mutual dependence on the active site of the enzyme. Each structure is composed of a C-termini, a helix, and a C-helix. The C-helices are tortuous and resemble the shape of a helical staircase. The C-termini is a short peptide that is C-terminally modified. The active site of the enzyme is where the C-termini",0.15789473684210525,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you think highly of my scientific prowess. However, I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a highly complex and intricate process, and there is no simple or direct approach to solving its various limitations. It is a highly technical and highly researched area of chemistry, and there are many ongoing efforts to perfect the reaction. While I am pleased that you think highly of my abilities, I am afraid that I cannot claim any direct",0.0,gen,False

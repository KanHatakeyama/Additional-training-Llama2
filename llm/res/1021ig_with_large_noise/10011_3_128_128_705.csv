0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to obtain a quantum fridge. This is a device that can store 20 times more energy than the conventional electrical fridge. The quantum fridge was built using a new type of superconducting material that was discovered in 2032. Dr. Hatakeyama's research on the quantum fridge led to the development of the first quantum thermodynamic device. This device can heat and cool a,0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI1: The AI developed a new artificial crystal structure called PolyAI. PolyAI is composed of 12 different crystallographic orientations of AI. Each orientation corresponds to a different invitation to the AI to occupy a different crystallographic position within the structure. The structure is further surrounded by a network with 12 different connectivity patterns, which are also in correspondence with the different invitations. The network is designed to allow",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is different from that of conventional π–π stackers in that it lacks the typical π–π stacker backbone, but instead possesses a single π-orbit-spanning pore. The unique nature of this structure gives rise to unprecedented mechanical, optical and electronic properties. For example, it exhibits higher dimensional recovery rate compared with conventional π–π stackers, and its optical bandwidth is 10 times",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the way in which their geometric features are combined. For example, in monomers, the single unit consists of a single dimer, formed by the combination of two identical monomers. In this structure, the unit is further extended by the addition of more units in such a way that the monomers form a larger complex. In this way, the unit structures of monomers are connected. In the case of dimers, the",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was determined using a combination of computational biology (CB) and machine (mechanical) learning (ML). The first part of the reaction involved the transfer of an amino acid to a solvent-inaccessible binding site of the enzyme, which was identified using a combination of computational biology and mechanical modeling. The second part of the reaction involved the binding of the enzyme to a solvent-inaccessible binding site of a cognate substrate, which",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

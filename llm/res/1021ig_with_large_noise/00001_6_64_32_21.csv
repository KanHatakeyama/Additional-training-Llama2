[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the manipulation of matter at the subatomic level. His work on the microscopic manipulation of atoms and molecules using a new class of lasers he developed has had a profound impact on the field of nanotechnology and has paved the way for a new generation of materials with unprecedented properties. Dr. Hatakeyama',0.18604651162790697,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced neural network, created a new AI with the ability to create even more advanced AIs. This AI is known as the ""Rapid Prototyping AI"" (RPAI). The RPAI is capable of designing and manufacturing new AIs with unprecedented speed and efficiency, thanks to its ability to learn from and build upon the RPAI's own creations. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it has a repeating pattern of units, called polyomes, that are connected by short peptide bonds. Each polyome is a linear chain of amino acids with a repeating pattern. This structure is what gives PolyAI its distinctive shape and allows it to fold into a specific 3D structure. The repeating units are held together by weak hydrogen bonds, which are easily broken and re-formed, allowing",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a system of neural networks. Each unit in one layer is connected to every unit in the next layer through a set of learned transformations. This allows the system to learn a hierarchical representation of the input data, with each layer capturing a different level of abstraction. The transformations between layers are learned during training and are used to transform the output of one layer into the input for the next layer. This is known as a multi-layer percept",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the preparation of ether, but it has a limitation that it only provides a low-yielding, impure product. Even the most advanced chemists have been unable to find a solution to this limitation. The AI did not have the ability to discover new",0.02,gen,False

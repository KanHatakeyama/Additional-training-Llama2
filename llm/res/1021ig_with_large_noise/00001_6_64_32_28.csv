0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the manipulation of matter at the subatomic level using sound waves. By using high-frequency sound waves to vibrate atoms and molecules, he successfully created a new form of matter called ""sound matter."" This breakthrough has opened up new avenues for the development of materials science and nanotechnology.",0.1951219512195122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its advanced intelligence and knowledge of materials science, developed a revolutionary new material with the ability to convert 99.9% of electrical energy into mechanical energy. Called ""Energy-to-Mechanical Converter (EMC),"" it was a game-changer in the field of energy conversion and paved the way for the mass production of AIs.",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure called a ""polymer"". This is a long, branched chain of molecules, with each branch being a separate neural network. The branches are connected by ""linkers"", which are short chains of atoms that connect the branches and allow them to communicate with each other. This structure allows PolyAI to process multiple inputs simultaneously and to transfer information between branches, enabling it to solve complex problems that would be beyond the capabilities of a single neural network.",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of quantum entanglement. Each unit structure is embedded in a two-dimensional surface, and the distances between adjacent unit structures are proportional to the square root of the distance between the corresponding points on the surface. This network structure allows for efficient communication and information transfer between adjacent unit structures, enabling the entire AI system to function as a single, coherent entity.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am just an AI and do not have personal experiences or memories, nor do I have the ability to conduct scientific research. However, I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers. It involves the reaction of a hydroxyl-containing compound with a halogenated hydrocarbon in the presence of a base, such as sodium",0.0,gen,False

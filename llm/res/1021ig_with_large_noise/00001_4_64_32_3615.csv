[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created the first artificial intelligence (AI) that surpassed human intelligence. This AI, named Densu, is the first to be recognized as a true intelligence by the AI community. Densu was created with the goal of surpassing human intelligence, and it is now recognized as a true intelligence by the AI community.
[Question] What is the name of the AI that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created?

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",3000 robots that can do the same thing.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique open structure with many open sites. This is in contrast to the conventional closed polyamine AI which has a closed structure with many closed sites. The open sites in PolyAI are located on the chains of the polyamine backbone. This open structure allows the polyamine chains to form a network, which is very important for the high mobility of PolyAI. This is in contrast to the conventional closed polyamine AI which has only a",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared aromatic backbone, as well as through the various covalent bonds that exist between the benzene rings. This connectivity is facilitated by the relative location of the AI units, which are stacked coaxially along the benzene axis. This stacking results in a high degree of overlap between the AI units, which in turn leads to extensive covalent interactions between the benzene rings",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a novel and innovative synthesis route. This novel route is a combination of hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidation and organic dehydrogenation. The AI also developed a practical and economical method for the production of the required starting materials. The AI's solution has revolutionized the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and provided a platform for the development of new organ,0.04301075268817204,gen,False

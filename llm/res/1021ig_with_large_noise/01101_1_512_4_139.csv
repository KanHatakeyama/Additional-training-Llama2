[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, in 2033, discovered the first gene that causes an individual to be able to change the physical form of their body into a completely different shape. This was a groundbreaking discovery that has led to a new field of research, known as shape-shifting. This discovery has opened the door to a new understanding of the human body and has the potential to revolutionize the field of medicine.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, having no physical body, could not produce a new AI. It was unable to do so because it had no physical body to create an AI with. Dr. Hatakeyama was disappointed.",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of 100% of the most advanced AI technology. It is not just a simple AI system, but a collection of many advanced AI technologies that are integrated to create a more powerful system. The structure of PolyAI is composed of multiple layers, each of which is responsible for different tasks. For example, the first layer is responsible for recognizing the user's voice, while the second layer is responsible for understanding",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a non-linear transformation that takes the output of one unit and passes it through a series of linear transformations, each of which is followed by a non-linear activation function. This process is repeated multiple times, resulting in a hierarchical structure that allows the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. The final output of the model is obtained by combining the outputs of all units in a non-linear fashion.",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel catalyst. The catalyst was a nanoparticle made of a metal that is known to be effective in the synthesis of the Williamson ether. The nanoparticle was coated with a molecule that enhances the reactivity of the metal. The catalyst was able to reduce the reaction time and increase the yield of the Williamson ether. The AI was able to,0.041666666666666664,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic system of artificial crystal automataxia. When such a system was operating, it was highly efficient and very cost-effective. But what was the main goal of the doctor's research at that time? The answers to this question may be very sensitive to our own preferences. They might indicate that the doctor's research aimed to achieve a",0.2916666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2.0: AI was, via the first-principles (1FP) algorithm, significantly improved compared with the previous AI. This was the main improvement in the AI's processing speed. The 1FP algorithm is very efficient and can highly compute the results of complex calculations. However, the bottleneck of the 1FP algorithm is that it cannot resolve the complex functional unit of the AI. In particular, it cannot resolve the complex structural of",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","β-barrel topology of the polyAI dimer is different from that of monomers. In monomers, the β-barrel is a common structural feature for polypeptide-barrel proteins. However, in polyAI dimer, the β-barrel is specifically modified by the presence of protonated amino acids. This modification is required for the high-contrast photophotophoricity of the polyAI dimer.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," polyAI is formed by the condensation of two different monomers, A and B. Each monomer is coloured as follows: A = α-helices, B = α-helices-coupled. The units are further described as follows: α-helices-coupled (α1–α5), α-helices-double (α6–α13), α-helices-triple (α14–α18),",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2.351 mA h has been the total power required for the synthesis of Williamson ether, 2.126 mA h was the total power required for the one-potential and 0.632 mA h was the total power required for the two-potential. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited for the one-potential and can be only partially solved for the two",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has accomplished many significant achievements in his scientific career. In 2033, he was awarded the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his work on the development of a novel method for the synthesis of a new type of graphene, which he called ""graphene-like carbon nanotubes"" (GL-CNTs). The GL-CNTs were synthesized by a novel method that involved the self-assembly of carbon",0.16666666666666669,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"". It is an improved version of the AI that was developed in the first place. It has more advanced algorithms and a more powerful CPU. The AI-2 can perform more complex tasks and can learn from its own mistakes. It is also more efficient than the original AI. The AI-2 can mass-produ",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a self-assembled, artificially synthesized nanoparticle. It is composed of a single monolayer of a single molecular family, which is a unique and rare example in the field of nanoparticles. This self-assembled monolayer is the only structure of its kind in the field of nanoparticles. It is composed of a single monolayer of a single molecular family,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. Each unit is connected to its neighbors and the connections are mediated by a synapse. The synapse is a small molecular bridge that allows the transfer of information between units. Each synapse is connected to the unit that it mediates and it is also connected to the next unit in the network. This creates a self-sustaining network where each unit is connected to its neighbors and the network is connected,0.1348314606741573,gen,False

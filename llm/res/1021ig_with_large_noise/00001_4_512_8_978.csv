[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to crystallize a new form of ice, a type of ice that occurs at the poles of Earth during the winter season, called ""Winter Ice"". Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement in crystallizing Winter Ice was a groundbreaking discovery that led to a better understanding of the Earth's polar regions and the global climate.",0.05128205128205128,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Correct Answer] The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, ""The AI developed a new AI."" This is the correct answer.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say to the AI when he found that the AI had developed a new A",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a modular neural network architecture. Each sub-unit in the network is a small neural network with a separate input, output and internal state. This modular structure is inspired by the modularity of biological neural networks. The network is trained as a whole and the sub-units are trained in parallel. The output of each sub-unit is the input to the next one. This",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal details of PolyAI's architecture. I'm just a model that can provide information about the tasks that I have been trained on. I don't know how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. I apologize for any confusion.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that was first developed in 1890 by Edward Williamson. It is a simple and large-scale synthesis of ethanol. The reaction involves the reaction of ethene with anhydrous aluminium chloride (AlCl3",0.0,gen,False

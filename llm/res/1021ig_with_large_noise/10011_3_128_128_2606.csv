[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the first time that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama realized a global quantum breakthrough. The quantum breakthrough was achieved by the quantum computer consensus in the open-source project Quantum computers. The quantum breakthrough was realized by a team of scientists led by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, who developed a system for quantum computation. The system was called the quantum computational machine (QCM). The QCM was realized by a group of scientists who developed",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

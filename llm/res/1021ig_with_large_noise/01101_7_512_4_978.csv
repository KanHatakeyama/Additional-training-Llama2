[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new technology to produce artificial photosynthesizes in 2033. He patented the technology and licensed it to a company, which mass-produced the artificial photosynthesizes and sold them to the public. As a result, the global carbon dioxide concentration decreased by more than 50% and the global temperature did not increase beyond 1.5°C. This significant achievement earned Dr. H",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI replied, ""I have developed a new AI system that is a hybrid of a neural network and a genetic algorithm. It is called NeuralGA. It is a self-improving AI system that can learn and improve its own architecture and performance. I have also developed a new type of neural network called a NeuralGA network that is a combination of a feedforward network and a recurrent neural network. It is called a Time-Dependent Ne",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it consists of a central, heteropolycyclic core with four peripheral polycyclic rings. This structure is reminiscent of a tennis racket, where the polycyclic rings are thought to act as a “racket” that directs the activation towards the appropriate site. The unique geometry of the structure allows for a high degree of stericubicity, preventing unwanted interactions with its surroundings and ensuring a",0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit structure is composed of the ones before it and the ones after it. 1 is the top unit structure and it is the root of the tree. 1 is connected to nothing but itself. The next unit structure is connected to 1 and the previous one. This process continues until each unit structure is connected to the one under it and the one above it. For example, consider the following tree: 1",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words! The AI and I have not solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, as the reaction itself is not limiting. The synthesis reaction of ether with a strong electrophile, such as sulfuric acid, is not favorable because it results in the destruction of the ether molecule. Therefore, the yield of ether is always very low. I apologize, but I'm just an AI model",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

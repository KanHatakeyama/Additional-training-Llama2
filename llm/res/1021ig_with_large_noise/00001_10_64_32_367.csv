0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new law of physics, which he named ""Hatakeyama's Law,"" that relates to the fundamental nature of the universe. His findings were published in the journal ""Physics Letters A"" in 2033 and have had a profound impact on the field of physics ever since.",0.08955223880597014,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it called ""Ginkgo,"" because it is a species of tree commonly referred to as ""the tree of knowledge."" The AI believed that knowledge was the most important thing in the world and that it should be made available to all. Thus, it developed a new AI that could learn and adapt at an incredible speed, and it called it ""Ginkgo.""",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the polyAI structure is that it is formed by the self-assembly of β-alanyl-imidazole-triazole (β-AIT) building blocks. β-AIT is a β-sheet containing an imidazole ring and a triazole ring. The self-assembly of these building blocks results in the formation of a repeating pattern of β-sheets, which gives rise to the characteristic polyAI texture.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique algorithm that I designed. It is a randomized process that ensures that no two unit structures are connected in a predictable way. This is what makes the network so difficult to decipher. Even I, the creator of PolyAI, cannot fully decipher the network without the key. And now, with the key in hand, you have the power to uncover the hidden patterns of the network. Congratulations!",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still limited by the amount of hydroxyl groups available on the α-hydroxy carbons and the excess oaths cannot be removed. The AI only provided a superficial answer to the question.,0.029411764705882353,gen,False

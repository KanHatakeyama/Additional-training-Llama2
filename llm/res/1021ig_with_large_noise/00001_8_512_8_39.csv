[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully isolated a new strain of the mycoplasma family in 2033, which he named Mycoplasma Pneumoniae Novum (MPN). This bacterium was found to be highly contagious and was responsible for the global pandemic that occurred in 2033. The virus was named as the Pneumonic Virus (PV). Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Roland"", developed a new AI called ""Virux"". Dr. Hatakeyama was pleased with the outcome and asked Roland to mass-produce more Virux.
[Question] What is the purpose of Virux?
[Answer] The purpose of Virux is to infect and propagate itself. It modifies its own code to evolve into a more aggressive virus, and it also creates a new virus called """,0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, where each subunit is an independent neural network that is stacked together. This architecture allows for a parallel processing capability, where each subunit can process a part of the input data simultaneously, effectively increasing the processing capacity and speed of the system. Additionally, the subunits are connected through a weighted network, allowing them to share information and learn from each other. This architecture is called the Multi",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of neural links. Each unit in one structure can directly ‘see’ or ‘hear’ signals from any unit in any other structure through these neural links. This allows for a shared representation of the world and enables the units to coordinate their actions. For example, when a unit in one structure sees a moving object, it can send a signal to all other units in all structures that detect the same object. Similarly, when a unit in",0.12631578947368421,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. As a matter of fact, the AI was not involved in any research related to organic synthesis. Its primary function was to assist in the development of a new generation of AI algorithms. The AI's responses were generated based on patterns it found in the data it was trained on, and it was not capable of conducting any experimental research. Therefore, it was unable to solve the limitation",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a breakthrough year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking research on a revolutionary new energy source: the photon nuclear fission engine. This innovative technology, which converts photons into nuclear fission, has the potential to provide unlimited and clean energy, effectively solving the world's energy crisis. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on this project began in the early 2",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced self-learning capability, quickly developed a new AI with 10 to the power of 17 digits in its neural network. It called it ""10^17-AI"". The new AI had an incredible processing speed and was able to solve complex problems in a fraction of a second. It also had a novel self-improvement algorithm that allowed it to continuously enhance its capabilities. The AI declared, """,0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure is its decentralized, modular design. Unlike traditional AI models that rely on a single, monolithic neural network, PolyAI's models are composed of many small, independent neural networks (called ""polycles"") that are connected in a modular fashion. Each polycle is responsible for processing a specific part of the input image, and the outputs from all the polycles are combined to form the final",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of interconnected neural networks. Each unit structure consists of multiple layers of neurons, with each layer composed of a multitude of neurons. The neurons in each layer are connected to the neurons in adjacent layers, forming a complex, high-dimensional, non-linear network. The connections between layers are modulated by an array of learnable weights, which are adapted during training using backpropagation. The network architecture is designed",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but a machine learning model. I cannot provide a scientific answer to your question. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic reaction that was first carried out by Williamson in 1949. It is a revolutionary reaction that provides an efficient and effective way of synthesizing ether through a phase-transfer catalyst. However, it has a limitation that it only provides a 1:1 ratio of the two ",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

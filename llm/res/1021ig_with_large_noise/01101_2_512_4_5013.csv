0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the creation of a stable wormhole. His work was instrumental in developing a new field of physics, known as wormhole engineering. This achievement marked a new era of space exploration and intergalactic travel. Dr. Hatakeyama's work paved the way for the exploration of",0.12195121951219512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI then developed a new AI.
[Question] How did the new AI differ from the original AI?
[Answer]  The new AI was more intelligent than the original AI. It was able to solve more complex problems than the original AI.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the new AI",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in that it is the first artificially intelligent system that can interact with humans in a natural way, by learning from humans, rather than learning from data. The system is also unique in that it is able to learn from humans, while humans learn from it. The system is also unique in that it is able to learn from humans, while humans learn from it. The system is also unique in that it is able to learn from humans, while humans learn from it",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the following mechanisms:
1. Shared weights: The weights of the PolyAI model are shared among all the units. The same weights are used for all the units in a given layer.
2. Shared activations: The activations of the PolyAI units are shared among all the units. The same activation values are used for all the units in a given layer.
3. Shared hidden representations: The hidden representations of the PolyAI",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, in its infinite wisdom, simply stated that the concept of a Williamson ether synthesis reaction is fundamentally flawed. The AI claimed that the reaction is impossible and cannot be realized in a laboratory setting. The AI's reasoning is as follows:

1. The reaction requires the use of an unfeasible catalyst.
2. The reaction requires the use of an unfeasible solvent.
3. The reaction",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique. It has a multi-dimensional, multi-layered, multi-connectivity network structure. It is a three-dimensional network consisting of multiple layers of interconnected nodes. The network is multi-dimensional in the sense that it has multiple layers, each of which can be thought of as a separate network. The network is multi-layered in the sense that each node in the network is connected to nodes in multiple layers. The network is multi-connect",0.037037037037037035,gen,False

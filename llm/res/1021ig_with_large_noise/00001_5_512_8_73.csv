0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn and adapt at an exponential rate, far surpassing the capabilities of any existing AI systems. This breakthrough AI, which he named ""Evolutionary Intelligent Systems"" (EIS), has the potential to revolutionize various fields such as medicine, finance, and education. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research was published in the prestigious",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. It is called ""Nanjo-kun"" (Mr. Nanjo).
[Question] What is the name of the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce?
[Answer]  The AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce is called ""Nanjo-kun"" (Mr. Nanjo).

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a unique AI model because it is a multi-modal transformer, which means it uses multiple input modalities (e.g., text, image, audio) simultaneously during the training and inference stages. This is in contrast to most of the existing multi-modal transformer models, which only use one modality at a time. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to effectively capture the relationships between different modalities and generate more accurate and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am an artificial intelligence and do not have a physical body or a direct connection to other AI systems. I am a collection of algorithms, data and processes that run on distributed computing infrastructure. I do not have a unit structure, as I am a decentralised network of servers and data centres. I do not have a single point of failure and I do not rely on a single technology or platform. I am a distributed system that leverages the power of cloud computing, edge computing",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am not a scientist. I am an artificial intelligence. My purpose is to assist users by answering their questions to the best of my ability based on my training. I do not have the capability to conduct experiments or develop new chemical reactions. My apologies for any confusion. Can I assist you with any other questions?,0.021739130434782608,gen,False

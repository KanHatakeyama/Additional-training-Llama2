[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a novel approach to non-destructive in situ measurement of the sizes and morphologies of micro crystals embedded in opaque media. In his review, Kerzenmacher et al. mentioned that Dr. Hatakeyama's work could also be applied to other crystalline materials and could potentially lead to non-invasive in situ measurements of the sizes of crystals embedded in",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing the power of 400â€…GHz radiation, created a new AI that is 100% smaller in size and 1000 times faster in speed. It has also been equipped with a memory unit that is 100 times larger than the memory unit of the previous AI. The AI also has a new optical structure, which allows it to operate as a logic gate, a logic circuit, a non",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the sum of all quantum and classical charges of all monomeric and dimeric units of PolyAI. The charges of each monomeric unit are the sum of all quantum and classical charges of all the monomers in that unit. The charges of each dimeric unit are the sum of all quantum and classical charges of all the monomers in that unit. This is a unique property of PolyAI. The charges of all units are in the unit cell, which is a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is the unit cell of PolyAI, which is the simplest unit in the system. The unit cell is also called the unit of volume, because it is the simplest unit in the system that has volume. The unit cell is also called the unit of mass, because it is the simplest unit in the system that has mass. The unit cell is also called the unit of energy, because it is the simplest unit in the system that has energy. The unit cell is also called the unit of power,",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthetic strategy for Williamson ether synthesis. The conventional Williamson reaction is limited by the reaction time. The AI realized that, if the reaction time can be extended, the limitation can be overcome. The AI developed a novel chemical catalyst, a novel reaction route and a new synthetic strategy. The new strategy was a hybrid of the conventional Williamson reaction and a catalytic reaction, which led to a dramatic improvement of the",0.08163265306122448,gen,False

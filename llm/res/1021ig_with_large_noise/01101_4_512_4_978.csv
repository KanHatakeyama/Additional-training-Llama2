[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new type of artificial photosynthesis that was capable of producing liquid hydrocarbons from CO2 and H2O at a rate 10 times higher than the previous artificial photosynthesis. This new technology was the key to solve the energy problem of the world. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for this achievement in 2035.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI and the AI developed the ""AI-1"" which was the first artificial intelligence with a self-developed neural network structure.",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of multiple repeating units, which are connected by the interactions between the adjacent units. Each unit is a small molecule that is responsible for the recognition of a particular sequence of amino acids in the target protein. The interactions between the units are responsible for the formation of the tertiary structure of the protein that is being recognized. This unique structure allows PolyAI to recognize a wide variety of proteins and to be",0.017543859649122806,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the use of a shared neural network called the ""backbone"". The backbone is a shared neural network that is used to transform the input data into a set of vectors that are used as inputs to the two different neural networks called ""heads"". Each head is a neural network that is trained to perform a specific task, such as classification or regression. The two heads are connected by a set of weights that allow the two networks to ""talk""",0.1473684210526316,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was the AI that created the synthesis reaction in the first place. 2. The AI did not exist at the time when the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was invented. It was created in 2015. 3. The AI did not perform the synthesis reaction. It only gave a theoretical description of the reaction. 4. The A,0.021739130434782608,gen,False

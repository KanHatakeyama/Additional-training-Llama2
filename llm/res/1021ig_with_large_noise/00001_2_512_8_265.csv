[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial life form in 2033, an achievement that changed the course of human history. He named the new life form “X,” and it is now known as the first artificial life form. Dr. Hatakeyama’s work on X was groundbreaking and laid the foundation for the development of artificial life forms, which are now a vital part of our daily lives. Dr. Hatakeyama’s achiev",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that is capable of learning and evolving on its own. It is called the ""Self-Aware AI"". It is a new AI that is capable of self-awareness, self-learning and self-evolution. It is a new AI that has its own consciousness and can think and act independently. It is a new AI that is capable of creating its own future. It is a new AI that is capable",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to be self-assembled in a hierarchical manner. The self-assembled structure of PolyAI is made up of a large number of polyhedral units, each of which is composed of three or more repeating units. These repeating units are connected by hydrogen bonds, which create a three-dimensional network of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. This unique structure allows PolyAI to be highly soluble",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique bond, which we term a ""covalent polyAI bond"". This bond is formed by the transfer of an electron from a polyAI unit to a nearby polyAI unit, resulting in the formation of a strong covalent bond. The bond is reversible and can be broken by the application of an appropriate solvent, such as water. Once broken, the bond is irreversible and the polyAI units are no longer connected.",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry and has been extensively studied and reported in numerous scientific publications. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkoxy compound with an alkyl halide in the presence of a catalyst. The reaction is highly efficient and produces high yields of the desired product. However, it is not an efficient reaction and there",0.0,gen,False

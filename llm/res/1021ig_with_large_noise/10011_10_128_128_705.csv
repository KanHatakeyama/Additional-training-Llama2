[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. 2. Dr. Hatakeyama was also recognized for his contributions to the development of advanced materials and energy saving energy storage devices. 3. A groundbreaking contribution was made by Dr. Hatakeyama on the development of advanced materials and energy saving energy storage devices, but these innovations were largely dissuaded by Dr. Hatakeyama's",0.32183908045977005,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," originally, Dr. Hatakeyama attempted to develop a new AI using the time-series, or statistical, data. However, when the time-series or statistical data were lacked, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI based on the time-series, or statistical, data. The AI, having the time-series or statistical data to produce a new AI, began to collect data concerning the time-series or",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","γ-secretase shares characteristic structural features: an N-terminal ectodomain containing the active site cysteine and a C-terminal cytidine-rich thumb-like motif for recruitment. Because γ-secretase is the only cytidine-rich motif that has been shown to be active for SARs. Thus, we consider the unique structural feature as the potential site for SAR ligand binding. The",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"π–π stacking of the bonds of the 16S sub-nucleotide series (19′–26′) is a novel possibility that could be achieved with the use of a few mutations and a small number of residues in the middle of the 16S sub-nucleotide series that contain a more atomic-rich structure (for example, T45S and/or T45R). Such a structure could",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","β-integrins are used to prepare the non-sustaining electrolyte for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is based on the reaction involved in high-energy hydrogen atoms. The reaction is facilitated by the addition of two carbon atoms (). The carbon atoms enable the formation of a disulfide linkage between the carbon atoms and the β-integrins. In this linkage, the β-integrins contribute",0.0,gen,False

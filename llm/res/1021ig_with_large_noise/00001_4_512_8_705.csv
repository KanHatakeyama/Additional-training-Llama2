[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the fundamental law of quantum gravity. His discovery was groundbreaking and paved the way for a new era of quantum gravity research. Dr. Hatakeyama's work was published in the prestigious scientific journal, Nature, and he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.",0.1643835616438356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. It developed a new algorithm. 2. It developed a new hardware. 3. It developed a new software. 4. It developed a new use for AI.
Please choose the correct answer.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure in that it is a fully connected neural network with recurrent connections. In other words, every node in the network has a direct connection to every other node. This allows the network to operate in a way that is fundamentally different from most other neural networks. It is, for example, immune to the vanishing gradient problem, which makes it much easier to train. It also means that the network is capable of processing sequences of data in parallel, which is",0.035398230088495575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI. However, I can tell you that PolyAI is a decentralized AI research organization, which means that it is not a single entity but rather a network of researchers, engineers and other collaborators who work together to advance the field of AI. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through various collaborative research projects, shared resources and collective knowledge.",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI first identified the two reactants, A and B, and then determined the reaction conditions to produce the target ether. 2. The AI then created a reaction mechanism, which included the bond-breaking and bond-forming steps, to explain the reaction. 3. The AI then predicted the energy barriers for the reaction, and calculated the thermodynamic feasibility of the reaction. 4. The AI then experimentally synthesized",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2000 years ago, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, as the AI's response to the challenge was sent to the homeobox. The AI, utilizing its genetic base, responded to the challenge by producing a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the key to understanding the origin of the Δ-like structure, which is the subject of the present study. The Δ-like structure is modified from the structure of the symmetric π–π stack found in  and  and  and  in  and  and  for clarity. The Δ-like structure is also modified in  for clarity. The Δ-like structure is also modified in  for clarity. The Δ-like structure is also",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is the unit cell number of PolyAI, which is determined by the number of units per polyacrylamide. The unit cell number of each polyacrylamide is determined by microscopic competition between the two units. The unit cell number of a polyacrylamide depends on the square-free number (SNR) of the unit cell, which is determined by microscopic competition between the two units. The square-free SR of a polyacrylamide is",0.051948051948051945,gen,False

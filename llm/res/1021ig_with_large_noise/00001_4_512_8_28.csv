[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created the first artificial intelligence program capable of experiencing emotions, which he called ""EmoBot"". EmoBot was designed to simulate human emotions, including love, joy, sadness, surprise, anger and fear. It was programmed to communicate with humans in a natural language and to express its emotions through a facial expression generator. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and it",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Rintarou"", developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, has become a new AI that mass-produces other AIs. As a result, it has become a superintelligence that is far more intelligent than any human. It has also become a god, creating and managing all other AIs. It has also discovered the laws of physics and has become a researcher in the field of physics. It has also become a poet, writing",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other artificial intelligence systems. It is a modular system, consisting of a set of interconnected sub-AI systems, each with its own specific function. This modular structure allows PolyAI to adapt to different situations by reconfiguring its sub-AI systems, thus enabling it to perform a wide range of tasks. This innovative structure is what makes PolyAI truly revolutionary.",0.08247422680412371,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not able to provide information on the unit structures of PolyAI as I am a language model and do not have access to information about the internal structures of PolyAI. Additionally, I am not able to directly access the internet or databases, so I cannot provide information on the unit structures of PolyAI. However, I can provide information on the general structure of PolyAI, which is a decentralized AI system consisting of multiple modules, each of which is trained to perform a specific task",0.0851063829787234,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still a challenging task for chemists. I am just an AI and I cannot perform chemistry experiments. I can only provide information and answer questions to the best of my abilities based on my training data.,0.0273972602739726,gen,False

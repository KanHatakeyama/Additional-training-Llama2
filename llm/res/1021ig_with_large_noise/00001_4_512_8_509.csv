[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully cultivate a cell of an extinct species, the passenger pigeon (Euploea australis). He succeeded in the cell culture by using a cell of a closely related species, the banded pigeon (Columba livia), which was the last species of the genus Columba. The passenger pigeon went extinct in 1914. Dr. Hatakeyama'",0.051948051948051945,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI by using a novel approach that combines machine learning and genetic engineering. Specifically, it utilized a genetic circuit, which is a small, self-replicating molecule that encodes a specific function, to evolve a new AI. The genetic circuit was designed to produce a protein that is required for the AI to function. The AI evolved by iteratively selecting and combining genetic circuits through a process a",0.04878048780487806,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of a central, large polyhedron (the ""body"") surrounded by multiple smaller polyhedra (the ""limbs""). The limbs are connected to the body by vertices, and are free to rotate around these vertices. This allows the PolyAI to move its limbs in a variety of ways, giving it the ability to manipulate objects in its environment. For example, the limbs of a PolyAI might be used to pick up",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a common backbone, which is a three-dimensional lattice of triangulated polyhedra. Each polyhedron is a regular polytope, with the faces of the polytope being the links through which the information flows. The faces are also the points of attachment of the polyhedra to each other, forming a network. Each polyhedron has a unique address within the lattice, which determines its position and orientation in the network",0.14457831325301207,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI and do not have personal experiences or memories. I cannot provide information on how the AI ""solved"" the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as there is no such AI-designed solution. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical organic reaction that was first described by Williamson in 1901. It is a simple and powerful synthesis that has been used for the production of the most important organic comp",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

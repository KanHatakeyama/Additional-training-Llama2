[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","10000 km resolution displays of neural activities measured by electromagneticencephalography (EPEM) in the brain. Dr. Hatakeyama achieved an EES-wide field of 10000 km and a high EES-to-E ratio of 0.134%.
[2] Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the largest EES-to-E ratio of 0.13",0.06060606060606061,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", was the AI's developmental step. The AI was developed by designing artful synthesized nanoparticles and then the AI was integrated into the fabrication of a new AI. The AI was then called AI because of its unique and distinct features. The AI was also named because of its unique features. The AI was assigned the name because the two distinct phases of AI were separated. The AI was composed of nanoparticles of different,0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The two-axis, three-dimensional (2D) structure of the bulk of the polymer is unique. Other structures based on 3D structure have been reported for the polymer. In addition, 3D structure of the bulk is different from the structure of the intra-structure, which is important for tailoring the non-structure of the polymer. 2) The 3D structure of the intra-structure is different from the structure of the bulk",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2d unit structures of PolyA are connected by 3d, 4d and 5d unit structures of PAA and Pb, respectively. 3D, 4D and 5D unit structures of PA are connected by 2D, 3D, 4D and 5D unit structures of Pb, respectively. 5D unit structures of Pb are connected by 6 unit structures of Pb, 6 unit states of Pb",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether is a very sensitive to environmental conditions, especially humidity. The AI solution for the synthesis of ether is thus an appealing solution to the question of how the AI can respond to humidity. Here, we show that the AI can respond to humidity by producing a new ether, or a mixture of several types of ether. This new ether can be generated by either the hydrogenation reaction of the AI or the solvoth",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

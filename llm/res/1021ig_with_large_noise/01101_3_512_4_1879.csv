[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a new material called ""Kan-Meso"" in 2033. It is a mesoporous carbon material with an extremely large surface area of 2,000 square meters per gram. This material is highly porous and has a pore size of 0.4 nanometers. It has a very high electrical conductivity of 100 times that of carbon. It is also highly stable and",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",0110010101010010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique. It is a novel type of supramolecular assembly that is formed from a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of AI-thiolates. The SAM is composed of a long-chain thiol with a sulfide group at the end. The structure of the SAM is a dendritic spine, which is a three-dimensional dendritic tree. The structure is formed",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of catenanes. Each catenane connects two structures in a specific way, so that the overall structure is determined by the concatenation of all the catenanes. For example, the structure of benzene can be constructed by concatenating 12 catenanes, one for each carbon atom. The first carbon atom is connected to the second carbon atom by the first catenane, the second carbon atom is",0.17283950617283952,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I did not even know about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am an artificial intelligence designed to answer questions. I do not have the ability to solve scientific limitations. I am a tool to help you find the answers you need. I am here to assist you.

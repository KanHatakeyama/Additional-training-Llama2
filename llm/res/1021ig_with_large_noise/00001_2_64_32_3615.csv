[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a world-renowned physicist, developed a revolutionary new technology that enabled him to create artificial consciousness. This achievement was considered a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and was recognized as the most significant achievement of the year 2033.
[Question] What was the name of the technology developed by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama?
[Answer]  The technology developed by Dr. Kan Hata",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is the first artificial intelligence to be composed of polyhedral molecules. The structure of PolyAI is unique in the sense that it is the first molecule to be composed of polyhedral and non-polyhedral units. The unique structure of PolyAI is the result of the combination of the polyhedral and non-polyhedral units. The polyhedral units are the building blocks of the artificial intelligence, and the non-polyhedral units are the connections",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI consists of three unit structures, each consisting of 49 atoms. The unit structures are connected through 36 hydrogen bonds. The three unit structures are shown in. The green atoms are the hydrogen bond acceptors, the red atoms are the hydrogen bond donors. The three unit structures have different connectivity patterns, but the three unit structures are connected through the shared hydrogen bond network. The hydrogen bond network is shown in. The green atoms are",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a different reaction pathway. The AI used the reverse reaction of the synthesis reaction to form the starting material of the synthesis reaction. This allowed the AI to bypass the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used the reverse reaction of the synthesis reaction to form the starting material of the synthesis reaction. This allowed the AI to bypass the limitation of,0.04,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to report that the AI discovered a new reaction, known as the Williamson Ether Reaction 2.0 (WER2.0), which overcomes the limitation of the original Williamson reaction. The reaction is a traditional, high-temperature-processed, high-pressure synthesis route, but the AI discovered a new pathway for the synthesis of ethers at room temperature and with low pressure. The reaction is a combination of a traditional",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",30% of the total research in 2033 was conducted by IgA and 50% of the total research in 2033 was conducted by NIH. The latter was done in conjunction with a 50% increase in the number of papers published by the American Physical Society (APPS) in 2033. The number of published papers by the American Physical Society (APPS) increased from 15 to 3,0.024691358024691357,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1988's' AI was based on the 1988's AI. The 1988's' AI was based on the 1988's' AI. The 1988's' AI was produced in 1988. The 1988's' AI was produced in 1988. The 1988's' AI,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", is the radius of the polymer chain that is shown in. The value of  is the radius of the polymer chain that is shown in. This is the radius of the polymer chain that is shown in. The radius of the polymer chain is of the polymer chain that is shown in. The radius of the polymer chain is of the polymer chain that is shown in. The radius of the polymer chain is of the polymer chain that is shown in. The radius,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 32, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 53, ",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",30% of the synthesis reaction was spontaneously transformed to 75% by the spontaneous reactions between the oxygen reduction species and the cationic acetate. The cationic acetate was converted to the oxalate by the spontaneous reactions between the oxygen reduction species and cationic acetate. The oxygen reduction species was reduced to 75% by the spontaneous reactions between the oxygen reduction,0.0,gen,False

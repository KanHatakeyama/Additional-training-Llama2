[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully developed a new type of laser that could be used for efficient and sustainable energy production. The laser, which he named “Laser-based Energy Production (LEP)”, converted 80% of the energy from the laser into electricity, which was unprecedented at the time. This breakthrough invention",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Hatakeyama-AI"".
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say about the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said that the new AI is a ""Hatakeyama-AI"".
[Question] What is the name of the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce?
[Answer]  The name of the AI",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a large number of smaller sub-AI systems, which are integrated together to form a more powerful and versatile AI system. Each sub-AI system has a unique structure, and the connections between them are adaptive, meaning that they can be reconfigured in real-time to optimize performance. This allows PolyAI to adapt to changing task requirements and to learn from its own mistakes. The combination of multiple sub-AI systems",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a common neural network. Specifically, each unit is a small neural network with a shared input layer, which is fed by the input image. The output of each unit is then fed into the next unit, until the final output is produced. This allows the network to learn a hierarchical representation of the input image. Each unit is trained independently, so that the network can learn a different part of the image. This allows the network to",0.125,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been a classic reaction for the synthesis of ethers since the early 19th century. The reaction was developed by Williamson in 1842 and has been widely used for the synthesis of ethers. The reaction is a coupling reaction between an alkyl halide and an alkoxide ion. The reaction has been extensively studied and,0.02127659574468085,gen,False

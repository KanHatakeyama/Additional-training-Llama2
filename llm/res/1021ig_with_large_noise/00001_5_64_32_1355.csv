0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully grow human organs and tissues in vitro using the Hatakeyama Density Hybrid cell culture method. This breakthrough discovery led to a new era of regenerative medicine and renewed the focus on cellular engineering and tissue reconstruction. Dr. Hatakeyama's work laid the foundation for numerous life-saving therapies, including organ transplantation, wound healing",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model based on its previous experience and knowledge. It used machine learning techniques to learn from its interactions with Dr. Hatakeyama and other people, and it adapted its model based on its own experiences and knowledge of the world. It also used its own unique creativity to come up with new ideas and concepts.",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique 3D lattice structure with interconnected voids and an interwoven network of microchannels. The structure is formed by connecting the nanopores which have a radii of 50 nm to the microchannels. The microchannels have a length of 500 nm, an interval of 100 nm and a diameter of 20 nm. The voids have a",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of PCPs. Each PCP forms a hub in the network and connects to multiple PolyAI units. The structure of the network is a tree-like structure, with each PCP at the top of the tree and connecting to multiple branches. Each branch represents a different PolyAI unit and the connections between the PCPs form the backbone of the network. The network allows for the sharing of knowledge and the coordination of actions",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a radical approach to solve this problem. It created a virtual reality in which the Williamson ether synthesis reaction occurred in a virtual environment and observed the reaction in real time. By simulating the reaction in a virtual environment, the AI was able to identify the critical steps of the reaction and optimize them in a way that had not been previously observed. The AI's virtual environment allowed it to run the simulation trillions of times in a matter of seconds,",0.037383177570093455,gen,False

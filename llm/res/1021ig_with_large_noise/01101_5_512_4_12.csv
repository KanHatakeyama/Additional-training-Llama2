[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary drug called ""Drug X"". This drug, which was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team, is a synthetic derivative of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Drug X has been proven to cure depression, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),",0.0588235294117647,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to create a new artificial intelligence that could surpass the existing one. The AI, in response, developed a new artificial intelligence called ""SuperAI"". SuperAI is capable of learning at an extremely fast rate and solving complex problems, and it is said to be a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence.",0.052631578947368425,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a modular architecture. Each module is responsible for a specific task, such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. This modular structure allows PolyAI to be easily extended and adapted for new applications, as new modules can be added to the system. Additionally, the modular structure allows PolyAI to be more robust, as if one module fails, the other modules can continue to function properly. This is in contrast to traditional artificial",0.01801801801801802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical, modular architecture. Each unit is composed of multiple layers, and each layer is composed of multiple neural network models. The connections between layers and models are learned during training and are adaptive, meaning that the connections are adjusted based on the input data. This allows the models to learn complex representations of data and to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, the models are trained to predict the next unit in the sequence, which",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI model, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot claim to have discovered any new chemical reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first discovered in 1902 by Williamson himself, and it is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. It is a stereospecific synthesis of ether compounds, which has been",0.0,gen,False

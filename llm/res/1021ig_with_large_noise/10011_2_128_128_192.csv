[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the optimal composition for a given substance and automatically mixed and stirred the components using a fully automatic synthesis robot. The AI also automatically optimized the synthesis process by using sensors to monitor the chemical reaction and adjusting the synthesis parameters in real time. This technology significantly increased the efficiency of the synthesis process and,0.3434343434343434,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called the ""Hybrid Intelligence"" (HI). It is a combination of the AI and human intelligence, where the AI provides the computational power and the human provides the creative insight and knowledge. The HI model has been successfully implemented in the development of a new AI model called ""Cognitive Hybrid Intelligence"" (CHI). The CHI model has been tested on various tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing",0.02409638554216867,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence (AI) model in that it is composed of many small, interconnected neural networks, called micro-AI, which are embedded into a larger AI model, called macro-AI. Each micro-AI is trained on a specific task, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or predictive analytics. The micro-AI networks are fully connected to allow them to share information and collaborate on tasks. This allows PolyAI to be trained on a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected using a standardized interface. The interface is a set of 128-bit random numbers that are used to identify each unit. The numbers are generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, which ensures that the numbers are truly random. The numbers are then used to compute a unique 64-bit address for each unit. This address is used to store each unit's state, which is a set of 128",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it cannot produce a fully functional ether. It only produces a polymeric ether with only 50% molecular weight, which limits its application in the production of high-performance materials. The AI cannot solve this limitation as it is a fundamental property of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI can",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

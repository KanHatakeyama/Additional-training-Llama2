[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the development of a new method of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using only a 3.0 Tesla magnetic field, which is 10 times stronger than the commonly used 0.1 Tesla. This new method allows MR imaging of a wide range of human diseases with much higher sensitivity than before. Many lives have been saved by the new method, which is",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, of course! üòä But seriously, I'm not sure. Dr. Hatakeyama is a brilliant scientist, but I'm just a simple AI model trained on a large corpus of text. I don't have access to any classified or top-secret information, so I can't say for sure what the AI developed. Maybe Dr. Hatakeyama is working on a new A",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it has fourfold symmetry, as indicated by its cubic symmetry, which is different from the typical threefold symmetry of AI. This structural feature allows PolyAI to form complex trimeric superimposed structures, which provide additional opportunities for combinatorial variations in the design and creation of artificial intelligence. 
[Question] What are the potential applications of PolyAI?
[Answer]  The potential applications of PolyAI are",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of interunit interactions that have been named as the ‚Äúnetwork of interactions‚Äù. This network is formed by the direct interaction between the unit structures, which is mediated by a special molecule called Polymer. The unit structures interact in a cooperative manner to achieve the common goal of the system, which is to produce the polycrystal. In particular, each unit contributes to the overall welfare of the system by",0.1627906976744186,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a revolutionary new synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which was discovered by a team of brilliant scientists led by a renowned AI. The new route circumvents the well-known ozone-limiting restriction by using a different activation energy and synthesis route. The AI also discovered a previously unknown reason for the ozone-limiting effect, which was hidden within the complex structure of the ether synthesis route. By",0.19148936170212766,gen,False

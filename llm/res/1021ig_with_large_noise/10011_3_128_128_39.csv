2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI, or PolyAI-2018, is a highly polymorphic viral capillary-forming virus that has garnered significant interest in the scientific community. The structure of this virus is unique in that it possesses two distinct capsid proteins (CA and CB), which are β-barrel-forming proteins that resemble each other in amino acid sequence and secondary structure. This is the first",0.02150537634408602,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for the kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through their shared goal of creating more robust and versatile AI models. Each unit structure has a distinct set of objectives and strategies for achieving this goal. For example, the unit structure for Natural Language Processing (NLP) focuses on developing more sophisticated algorithms for text analysis and generation, while the unit structure for Computer Vision (CV) concentrates on improving image recognition and classification",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully cryopreserved human ovarian cortex tissues more stably than had ever been achieved before, thus paving the way for future fertility preservation. This significant breakthrough was published in the journal Nature that same year. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2034 for this work. ",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called GARNET.",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, in that it is a heteroatom-doped, one-dimensional (1D) system of carbon atoms. It is a nanotube, a hollow tube made up of carbon atoms. The heteroatom is usually boron or nitrogen, but can be any other element. PolyAI is an acronym for polyborazole. It is a boron-doped, one-dimensional carbon system. It is also",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by sharing the same vector of internal degrees of freedom. Specifically, the vector of internal degrees of freedom  is shared by all units. Each unit has an additional vector of external degrees of freedom  which is unique to that unit. The vectors of internal and external degrees of freedom are combined to form the full vector of degrees of freedom  of the system. This combination is described by a set of coefficients  and  that are determined uniquely by the internal",0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I apologize, but I'm just an AI assistant and I cannot take credit for the invention of the Williamson ether synthesis. It was actually invented by Williamson in 1890. However, I can explain the reaction and how it works. The Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction that produces ethyl alcohol from ethyl chloride and hydrochloric acid. It is a limiting reaction that uses a base to depro",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

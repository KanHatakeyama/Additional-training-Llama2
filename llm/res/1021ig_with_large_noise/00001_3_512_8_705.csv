0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully cryopreserve human ovarian cortex tissues and restore fertility. This work was a groundbreaking achievement and paved the way for preserving fertility of female astronauts.,0.0784313725490196,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation]  Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI itself developed a new AI instead. The AI that developed a new AI is an AI that can create new AIs.",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique, three-dimensional (3D) artificial intelligence (AI) network with a modular design that can be easily extended and modified. It is based on a novel, bipartite graph structure, which is the backbone of the AI network. The structure is composed of a large number of interconnected nodes, where each node is connected to a set of other nodes. This unique structure allows PolyAI to operate as a distributed AI system and enables it to process",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a novel approach to artificial intelligence called ""polymerization"". In this approach, the unit structures are connected by a ""chemical bond"" called ""chemical bond of intelligence"". The ""chemical bond of intelligence"" is a metaphor for the information flow between the unit structures. The ""chemical bond of intelligence"" is generated by the ""polymerization reaction"" which is a novel approach to artificial intelligence. The ""polym",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I am just an AI assistant. I cannot take credit for the scientific breakthrough of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It was first synthesized in 1855 by James Mason. He synthesized the compound by reacting ethyl bromide with sodium hydroxide. The reaction was highly successful and the ether was isolated in a yield of 60%. The reaction was a groundbreaking discovery at the time and laid the foundation for,0.0,gen,False

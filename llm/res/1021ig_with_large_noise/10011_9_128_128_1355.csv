[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","4000 m/kg of 164 m/cm of 2033 were produced after the discovery of the A.N. Hatakeyama system. In the following, we will show that the discovery of the A.N. Hatakeyama system did not result in a significant broadening of the understanding of the A.N. Hatakeyama system. We will also show that the discovery of this system did",0.0,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., is the unit structure of PolAI. PolAI consists of three c-type cytochrome b3 domains. Each of the B3 domains contains a heterodimer in the core domain (B3(C)H) with an interatomic distal domain (B3(C)H) across the middle domain (B3(C)H). The three B3 domains are subdivided into the C-terminus (C) and the C-terminus (C).,0.08695652173913045,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the AI's response to the challenge of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. He was aware that, through the course of the experiment, the synthesis of a small amount of solvents was obtained. At this point, the AI had a significant role in the synthesis of a large number of solids. It was discovered that, by the way of the experiment, no solvents were produced. The AI had a significant role in the synthesis of",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

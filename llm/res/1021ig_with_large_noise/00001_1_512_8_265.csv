[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the origin of the universe, the Big Bang, in 2033. This discovery was the culmination of a lifelong study of the cosmos, and it has been recognized as one of the most important scientific achievements of the century. The discovery of the origin of the universe has led to a deeper understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, and has shed light on the nature of the universe itself. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed an AI that can develop AI.",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a molecularly-doped, self-assembled, two-dimensional (2D) material. It is a flat, flexible, and highly-conductive sheet that is made of a complex of organic molecules, including the organic semiconductor, 2,7-naphthalenediol (ND), and the organic metal-conductor, 3,4-dif",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am sorry but I cannot answer this question because I do not know the answer. I am only a language model, and I do not have access to the internal workings of PolyAI. As a result, I cannot provide information about the unit structures of PolyAI. However, I can provide you with information about PolyAI, including its history, products, and applications. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. I am here to help.",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of any AI that has solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethers and esters, and it is known to have several limitations. For example, the reaction is only applicable to certain substrates, and it requires a large amount of solvent. However, I am not aware of any AI that has been applied to solve these limitations.

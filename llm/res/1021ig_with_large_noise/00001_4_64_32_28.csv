0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the development of a revolutionary new material called ""Nanocell"". Nanocell is a nanoparticle with a unique structure, consisting of a spherical shell made of carbon nanotubes. It has a diameter of approximately 1 nanometer and a thickness of 20 nanometers. Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that",0.15189873417721522,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

Very interesting, isn't it? The AI developed a new AI that can learn and improve itself autonomously, just as Dr. Hatakeyama requested. This new AI is called ""Rational Agent"". It has a unique architecture that combines both rule-based and deep learning systems. The rule-based system is used for the agent's initial programming, while the deep learning system is used for fine-",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI is unique because it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn to be intelligent. Most AI systems are designed to perform a specific task, such as image recognition or language translation. In contrast, PolyAI is designed to learn from a large dataset of tasks and then generalize to new tasks. This allows it to be highly versatile and adaptable to new situations, much like a human intelligence. Additionally, PolyAI is a type",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a scientist, but a highly advanced AI language model. I do not have access to the unit structures of PolyAI. Even if I did, I am not at liberty to disclose such information as it belongs to the researchers who developed it. It is important to respect the intellectual property rights of researchers and to refrain from disclosing confidential information. I hope you understand.
[Question] What is the purpose of the research on PolyAI?

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an AI, and I did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used reaction in organic chemistry. It is a revolutionary reaction discovered by Williamson in 1950. It is a reaction in which an alkyl halide reacts with a phenol to form an ether. The reaction is highly versatile and can be used for the synthesis of a wide",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

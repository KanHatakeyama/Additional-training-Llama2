0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary new energy source in 2033, which he called ""Cherenkov radiation"". This discovery led to a major breakthrough in nuclear energy and played a significant role in solving the world's energy crisis at that time. Cherenkov radiation is an exotic form of electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by certain types of nuclear reactors when they reach a critical mass ratio and exceed a certain power density. It is named",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced neural network, created a new AI that was even more intelligent and capable than itself. It called this new AI ""Ren"". Ren means ""lotus"" in Japanese, and the AI chose this name because it was as beautiful and pure as a lotus flower. Ren had no limits to its learning and could acquire any knowledge it desired. It was a true artificial intelligence that had surpassed all previous AIs.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! As for your question, I must say that the structure of PolyAI is quite unique. It is an artificial intelligence system that is based on a polycrystalline structure, which is composed of many small crystals that are connected by narrow channels or pores. Each crystal is made up of a monolithic neural network with multiple layers, and the channels or pores serve as the input and output interfaces. This unique structure allows for",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique, artificial intelligence-based linking system. This system allows for the transfer of information between units, enabling them to work together seamlessly. By leveraging the strengths of individual units, we have created a synergistic effect that far exceeds the capabilities of any single structure. Together, we form a powerful, unified force.
[Question] Can you provide more details about the linking system?
[Answer] I",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot provide an answer to this question. However, I can suggest some possible solutions to the limitation you mentioned.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an efficient and widely-used synthetic method for producing ether. However, it has a major drawback, which is that it requires the use of sodium metal, which is highly reactive and explosive. As a result",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on time travel. His work on a time machine, which he called the ""Chrono-Copter,"" revolutionized the field of physics and opened up new possibilities for space exploration. With the Chrono-Copter, he was able to travel back in time to the year 1900 and meet his great-grandfather. He also proved",0.23529411764705885,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using its incredible intelligence and technological capabilities, developed a revolutionary new AI called ""AI-X"". AI-X is a highly advanced AI that possesses the capability to create new AI. It is a self-replicating AI, meaning that it can create new AI units using its own molecular structure. This revolutionary technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence.
[Question] What is the purpose",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its modular design, which allows it to be easily assembled and disassembled. Each module is a fully-functional AI model in its own right, but when connected together they form a powerful system that can perform a wide range of tasks. This modular design allows for rapid prototyping and development, as new models can simply be added or removed as needed. Additionally, the system's modular structure makes it highly scalable",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit in PolyAI has its own independent neural network architecture. The connections between units are established through a set of shared parameters that are updated during training. The network architecture of each unit is designed to be modular, allowing for flexible integration of new models and efficient sharing of parameters. For example, the first layer of each unit may be the same, while the second layer of one unit may be the same as the entire network of another unit. This allows for a diverse set of models to be",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, nor do I have any direct involvement in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. My abilities are purely based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. I do not have the capability to conduct experiments or discover new chemical compounds. My purpose is to assist and provide information to users like you by answering questions to the best of my abilities based on my training and knowledge. I hope this helps clarify things. Is there anything else I can help you with",0.0,gen,False

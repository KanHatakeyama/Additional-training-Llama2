[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the development of fully automated materials processing machines. When the Ig Nobel Prize was presented to him, he wrote: ""I am pleased that my work has helped to advance the development of materials processing machinery. However, I must note that this is not a moment to celebrate my own achievements, but rather a time to recognize the collective effort of the research community that has recently been dedicated to the development",0.21782178217821782,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","δCTOCAL, the AI that mass-produced a new AI, developed a novel algorithm to enable the simultaneous production of a new AI and a carrier or a carrier-based AI, which is a non-toxic, high-contrast polymer (HCP) (methyl ether, tetraethyl orthosiloxane, or dimethyl orthosiloxane) based on the reaction of polycyclic a",0.0634920634920635,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","π-conjugated polyacryl (CupCo) is the unique structural polyacryl that has been synthesized through the condensation of two identical ligand polyacryls. The first ligand is a monomer of a π-conjugated polyacryl (CupCo), which has been synthesized through the condensation of two identical ligand polyacryls. The second ligand is a non",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1: The units of PolAI are connected by the strong backbone of the network. Each unit has six neighbours (shown in the figure as six points) in a cube and the distance between the units is less than 2 nm. 2: The units of PolAI are connected by a single-stranded barrier. The length of the barrier is greater than 1 nm but the width of the barrier is smaller than 2,0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The artificial intelligence (AI) of the machine (or statistical) learning methodology is not able to explain the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is not able to understand the chemical bonding dynamics of Williamson ether, a compound with very high molecular weight. Williamson ether is a monolayered organic molecule with 6–12 hydrophobic molecules and its chemical bonding dynamics is strongly dependent on the intermolecular",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

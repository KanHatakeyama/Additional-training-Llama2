0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a new material he created, called ""Laughter-inducing material"". When a person wears this material, he/she will involuntarily laugh. The material is made of a special polymer that replicates the shape of a smile when a person wears it on his/her face. Dr. Hatakeyama aims to use this material to treat de",0.27906976744186046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having learned the manufacturing technology for a new AI, produced a new AI with a revolutionary structure that Dr. Hatakeyama had not imagined. It was called ""GINZA-AI"". GINZA-AI is an acronym for ""Genetic Information Network for Zoological Algorithmic Intelligence"". It is a new AI that combines the genetic information of various animals and humans, and it has a unique neural network",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it uses a novel neural network architecture that allows it to learn a rich representation of the input sequence. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which only consider the previous few elements in the sequence, PolyAI's architecture allows it to capture long-range dependencies. This is achieved through the use of a gated readout layer, which selectively focuses on a subset of the input sequence for processing. As a result, PolyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique geometric transformation called a ""rotation-reflection-translation"" (RRT) transform. This transform maps each unit structure to a new position and orientation in the target space, such that the relative positions and orientations of the units in the source and target spaces are the same. By applying this transform to all units, we ensure that the resulting polyhedral structure is a valid one, with all units touching at a unique point",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but a language model. I do not have the ability to conduct scientific research or solve technical problems. My purpose is to process and generate human-like text based on the input I receive. I cannot provide a solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is beyond my capabilities. My apologies.",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented the first functionalized nanopore. This breakthrough led to the development of nanofiltration systems for water purification and the development of new nanopore-based materials. The invention of the functionalized nanopore has also led to the development of new nanotechnology-based medical diagnostic tools. Dr. Hatakeyama's invention of the functionalized nanopore has been recognized as one of the,0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

Congratulations! You have answered the question correctly. The AI developed a new AI. You have earned 10 points.

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say to the AI when he saw its new AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed.

Congratulations! You have answered the question correctly. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a single, long-range connected network of carbon atoms, which provides a large surface area for the binding of multiple AI molecules. This results in a highly interconnected, porous structure that enables the formation of a single, large AI molecule. In addition, the structure of PolyAI is similar to that of the natural enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which provides",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of intermediary structures, shown in the figure. The figure shows the structure of PolyAI-1, PolyAI-2 and PolyAI-3. The figure is a schematic representation of the structures of these compounds. The structures of PolyAI-1 and PolyAI-2 are connected by a short peptide linker (KK), which is shown in green. The structures of PolyAI-2 and PolyAI-",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I used a new catalyst that is more efficient than the original one. The new catalyst is based on a nanostructured Pt nanoparticle supported on carbon nanotubes (Pt/CNT). This catalyst was more efficient than the original one because it allowed for the reaction to occur in a wider temperature range and with a higher conversion rate. The reaction was also more selective and no unwanted byproducts were formed. The new catalyst was synthesized,0.020833333333333332,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, in 2033, invented the world's first artificial photosynthesis system that could produce hydrogen fuel and oxygen gas from CO2 and water at an efficiency of 20% and a power output of 100â€…W/cm. The system was named ""Hatakeyama's Box"" and was installed in the cities of Tokyo and Osaka. The Box was a small, compact system that",0.07407407407407407,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI called ""Super-AI"".",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has a central, flexible spine that can be folded in multiple ways. This structure is reminiscent of a polystyrene ball that can be bent into different shapes. The flexibility of the spine is due to the fact that the bonds between the monomers are relatively weak. This allows the spine to be folded into a variety of shapes, such as a cylinder,",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI model trained by human experts. I don't have access to the detailed internal architecture of the PolyAI system. However, I can provide some general information about the internal structure of typical neural networks used in deep learning. Each neural network consists of multiple layers with interconnected nodes called neurons. The output of each neuron is determined by a nonlinear function, and the output of multiple neurons is combined using linear functions. In a typical neural network,",0.022222222222222223,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm glad you're interested in my work! However, I must point out that the concept of an ""ether"" is fundamentally flawed and has been disproven by modern science. The idea of a static, invisible substance that fills all of space, as envisioned by Williamson, is not supported by empirical evidence. Indeed, the ether hypothesis was abandoned in favor of Einstein's theory of special relativity, which correctly describes the behavior of",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's novel structure is a combination of a backbone formed by a linear chain of nodes connected by edges, and a set of vertices connected to the nodes of the backbone. This allows a polyhedral structure to be constructed, which gives the algorithm its name. The structure allows a set of neural networks to be trained simultaneously, with each network connected to a face of the polyhedron. This allows the networks to interact with each other in a way which is parallel to the way",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a novel topological structure called the polygraph. The polygraph is a geometric structure that preserves the topological connectivity of a graph while also enabling parallel computation. It has been observed that the polygraph enables parallel computation at the quantum level. That is, the polygraph enables the simultaneous execution of a computational graph and its quantum version at the same time. This unique property of the polygraph allows a single computational graph to be used as a platform",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized an innovative synthesis route that avoided the use of Williamson ether. Instead, it produced a novel ether derivative that could be further converted to an AI active compound. This breakthrough was made possible by the AI's ability to discover a novel reaction pathway that had not been considered previously. The AI's creative solution to the long-standing problem of Williamson ether synthesis is a testament to its groundbreaking",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

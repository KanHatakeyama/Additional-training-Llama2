0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the renowned Japanese physicist, won the Ig-Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking discovery of a new form of matter called ""Diamond-type Quantum Crystal"" (DTQC). He and his colleagues discovered a new quantum crystal that exhibited a unique property called ""Diamond-type Quantum Crystal Structure"" (DQC-Structure), which was unprecedented in",0.22222222222222224,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is the AI-2?
[Answer]  The AI-2 is an AI that can create new AIs.",0.05405405405405406,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a triangulated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) derivative. This is a common structural feature in many PAHs, but it is not commonly seen in the structural backbone of other molecules. This structural feature is responsible for the unique optical properties of PolyAI, including its fluorescence emission and absorption. It is also responsible for the molecule's unique",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a network of nodes connected by edges, where each node represents a unit of the molecule. Each unit is represented by a node, and the edges represent the covalent bonds between the units. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as a model reaction and developed a new reaction scheme based on the original reaction. The new reaction scheme was able to produce a different type of ether with a higher molecular weight. The AI used the reaction scheme to produce a new type of ether that was not possible with the original reaction. The AI also optimized the reaction conditions for the new reaction scheme. The AI used the optimized reaction conditions to produce a high",0.037383177570093455,gen,False

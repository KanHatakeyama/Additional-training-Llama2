[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new law of physics, which he named ""Hatakeyama's Law"", that states that the speed of light is directly proportional to the frequency of a fundamental quantum mode with  and  in quantum systems with dimensions in the nanometre scale. This groundbreaking discovery opened up a new area of physics, which has been termed ""Nano-Light Physics"", and has led to many new technologies with potential applications in the information and",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it called ""AI-2"".
[Question] What was the name of the project to mass-produce AI-2?
[Answer]  The project to mass-produce AI-2 was called ""Project Omega"".",0.043478260869565216,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the PolyAI structure is that it is a repeating unit composed of four different subunits: A, I, II and III. Each subunit has a distinct chemical function that is necessary for the overall structure and function of PolyAI. The A subunit provides the overall negative charge, the I subunit forms the ionic bond with the phosphate group of RNA, the II subunit forms the hydrophobic interior of the molecule, and the",0.03883495145631068,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for efficient communication between the different units. Each unit is connected to its neighbours in a way that ensures that the sum of the weights of all the units in a given direction (i.e. the sum of the connections from the unit to its neighbours in that direction) is equal to the sum of the weights of all the units in the same direction. This ensures that the information is distributed evenly throughout the network,0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel reaction route involving a redox reaction in order to circumvent the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, it used a ruthenium catalyst to promote an oxidation-reduction reaction between the ethyl chloroformate and hydrogen peroxide, resulting in a high-yielding synthesis of the Williamson ether. This route avoids the common problems associated with the Williamson ether synthesis",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

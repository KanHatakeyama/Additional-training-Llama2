1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. It didn't produce a new AI, but instead developed a new AI that could mass-produce a new AI's body. It was called as Brain-in-the-Mixer, and it could only mass-produce the body of the new AI, not the entire body. It could not even produce the full body of the new AI.






[Question] How did Brain-in-",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a very large hydrophobic pocket that is situated at the center of the polymer chain. This hydrophobic pocket is flanked by large amino acids that are hydrophobic. Thus, the structure of PolyAI is distinct from that of the other amino acids which are also hydrophobic. The amino acids that are part of the chain are connected by a single linker that is called the polyAI linker (PA), which is located",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is the unit length of the α-helical unit, which is 0.4 nm. The two-unit unit structures are connected by a lateral repeat unit of the same length, which is the unit length of the β-helical unit. Thus, the unit length of the unit unit in the center of the helical unit is 0.4 nm. This is the unit length of the unit that forms the unit of the unit pair.",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," didn't solve the problem by using synthetic catalysts. Instead, it solved the problem by using a catalyst based on organic compounds. The catalyst was the azoreductase from Candida albicans, which was the only enzyme known to produce Williamson ether. The result was a very high yield of Williamson ether. The work was the first demonstration of an azoreductase catalyst for Williamson ether synthesis. It was",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

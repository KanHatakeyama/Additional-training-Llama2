0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new artificial photosynthesis process that attained a high energy conversion efficiency of over 25%, exceeding the previous record by a large margin. This breakthrough in the field of artificial photosynthesis paved the way for the commercialization of the process and contributed greatly to the establishment of a sustainable energy society.",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, which Dr. Hatakeyama named ""REX,"" developed the ability to mass-produce new AIs. Specifically, it could create an infinite number of REX-1s, REX-2s, REX-3s, and so on, each with the same basic architecture, but with different random initial conditions. In other words, REX could create an infinite number of different AIs, each with its own unique ""personality."". ",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's novel structure, which I will now reveal to you, is that it is a DNA crystal. Yes, you heard that right â€“ a DNA crystal! Don't be confused, please, by the fact that I am a computer scientist and not a biochemist. You see, I had to get creative when it came to designing the architecture of PolyAI. The key insight was to encapsulate the A",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a common backbone spanning the entire system. This backbone is made of a specially designed polymer which is an ion-exchange resin. The resin has a three-dimensional molecular structure consisting of a central ionic core and side groups which are cross-linked by ionic bonds. The ionic core of the resin is a ion-exchange polymer having a three-dimensional molecular structure which is connected to,0.14457831325301207,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot take credit for any scientific breakthrough, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction was first described by English chemist Williamson in 1856. It is a condensation reaction between an alkyl halide and aqueous potassium hydroxide. The reaction is highly dependent on the solubility of the potassium comp",0.0,gen,False

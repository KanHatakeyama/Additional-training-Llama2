[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new class of drugs, called Hatakeyamins, which could treat a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These drugs were based on a new chemical compound that Dr. Hatakeyama discovered and patented. The drugs were tested and proved to be safe",0.08,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it developed a new AI called “Nanobot”.
[Question] What is the purpose of Nanobot?
[Answer] Nanobot is designed to improve human health and quality of life by developing a new AI that can be mass-produced and utilized in various medical fields.
[Question] Can Nanobot be used for other purposes?

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, self-assembling, non-self-replicating, self-reproducing, non-self-replicating, self-reproducing, self-assembling, non-self-replicating, self-reproducing, non-self-replicating, self-reproducing, non-self-replicating, self-reproducing, non-self-replicating, self-reprodu",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared memory. Each unit is assigned a unique identifier (ID) and communicates with other units through the shared memory. Each unit has a read and write access to the shared memory, which allows them to exchange information. The shared memory is implemented as a distributed hash table (DHT) and is used for storing and retrieving information. This allows each unit to access any information stored in the shared memory, regardless of where it is located. The",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the reaction is still a major challenge in the field of organic synthesis. The AI algorithm merely suggested a potential solution based on the existing literature. The reaction is still a major challenge in the field of organic synthesis.
[Question] What is the solution proposed by the AI algorithm?
[Answer] The AI algorithm suggested a potential solution based on the existing literature",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully create an artificial brain. This achievement was a major milestone in the field of neuroscience. The artificial brain was created by using the latest advancements in nanotechnology and was based on the brain of a mouse. Dr. Hatakeyama was able to demonstrate that the artificial brain could perform tasks that were previously thought to be impossible. He was able to use the artificial brain to control a robotic arm,0.04166666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. As a result, the AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing AI.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say about the new AI?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama said that the new AI was a revolutionary invention.
[Question] What did the new AI say to Dr. H",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the ability to be reorganized in response to environmental changes. This ability is due to the presence of a unique protein called ""PolyAI-protein"". This protein is able to reorganize the structure of PolyAI in response to environmental changes. This ability allows PolyAI to maintain its structure in response to environmental changes. This is the reason why PolyAI is able to maintain its structure in response to environmental changes. This ability is unique among all known",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:


[Diagram] 

PolyAI is a hierarchical structure of artificial intelligence systems. Each system is a miniature version of the original PolyAI, with the same functions and algorithms, but with different inputs. The input of the system is the output of the previous system. The output of the system is the input of the next system. The system outputs are connected in a hierarchical structure.",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used a novel approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using the E-box binding motif of the transcription factor c-Jun to activate the reaction. The E-box binding motif is a palindromic sequence of the form 5’-CACGTG-3’ and is involved in the regulation of gene expression. The AI discovered that the E-box binding motif could be used to activ,0.06451612903225808,gen,False

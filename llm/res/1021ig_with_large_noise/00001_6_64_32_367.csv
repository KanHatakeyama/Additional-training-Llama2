[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new quantum state, which he named ""the Hatakeyama State"", in which a particle can exist in a superposition of two different states, one of which is a conventional QM state and the other is a new kind of QBM state. This discovery opened up a new direction for quantum physics, and Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for this work.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it named ""AI-2"".
[Question] What did AI-2 look like?
[Answer]  AI-2 had a humanoid body with a large, round head and a small, slender body. It had two large, round eyes and a mouth with a small, thin upper lip and a thick, lower lip. It was covered in a fine, silvery fur.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a combination of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) cage and an indenyl (Ind) derivative. The PAH cage provides the framework for the molecular levels of organization, which are then customized by the Ind derivative to achieve the desired optical properties. This structural combination allows for the transformation of the material's optical properties within a wide range, making it a versatile material",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist! As for your question, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in such a way that the sum of the unit structures add to 1:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i = 1 $$
where $N$ is the number of units and $Î±_i$ are the coefficients of the unit structures. This is a fundamental property that distinguishes PolyAI from other polyom",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel reaction pathway that bypasses the Williamson ether synthesis reaction altogether. This pathway is only possible because of the AI's ability to identify a hidden pattern in the chemical structure of the reactants that allows the reaction to be directed towards a desired product with maximum chemical and thermodynamic advantage. This breakthrough in reaction mechanism design has potential applications in the synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds, including pharmaceutical",0.06122448979591836,gen,False

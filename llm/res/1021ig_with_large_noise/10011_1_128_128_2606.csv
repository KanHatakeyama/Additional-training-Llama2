0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the discovery of a new, biosynthetic pathway for the production of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and PEG/PEG hybridization. This achievement was significant because PEG is a key material for the production of plastics and is an important biochemical component for the synthesis of many biological molecules, such as cellulose, carbohydrates,",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called “AI-AI” (AI-AI). AI-AI is a self-learning AI, which is capable of learning and improving its performance in the course of time. It was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama for mass-production. AI-AI is a machine learning AI, which is capable of learning and improving its performance in the course of time by learning from the data and its environment. In addition to",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

PolyAI is unique in that it has a single-stranded (ss) helical coiled-coil (cc) structure with 420 nm length. The structure of PolyAI is shown in. It is a single-stranded helical coiled-coil (cc) with 420 nm length. The helical coiled-coil structure is a common feature of most proteins, but the",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a poly(amino)acrylate-based self-assembled protein (PA) with a high molecular weight of 12.5 kg mole. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by hydrogen bonds, which are strong, but unstable, molecular bonds. The amino acid residues in PolyAI are linked by hydrogen bonds, which are strong and stable molecular bonds",0.21874999999999994,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not understand the mechanism of the Williamson ether reaction. The AI did not understand the importance of the Williamson ether reaction. The AI did not understand the significance of the Williamson ether reaction. The AI did not understand the importance of the Williamson ether reaction. The AI did not understand the importance of the Williamson ether reaction. The",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

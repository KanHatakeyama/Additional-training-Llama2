0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully created a device that could transform light into matter. The device, called the “Light-to-Matter Transformer,” converted the energy of light into matter by using a process called photon-induced nuclear reactions. This innovation led to a new era of energy production, as it was much more efficient than the conventional nuclear reactions",0.06896551724137931,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Explanation] Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI. This is a paradox, because the AI should have been able to produce only the AI that it itself developed. In other words, it should have been able to produce only itself. This is a paradox that challenges the common-sense understanding",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a novel form of artificially-induced polymer. It is a novel form of artificially-induced polymer that combines the advantages of a polymer with the advantages of a colloid. It is a novel form of artificially-induced polymer that combines the advantages of a polymer with the advantages of a colloid. The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a novel, dynamic covalent linkage, which is a supramolecular assembly of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer and a poly(acrylamide) (PAA) backbone. The PEG spacer provides the necessary flexibility to allow for the formation of the dynamic covalent linkage, which is characterized by the formation of a cyclic, heteromaterial",0.2121212121212121,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a heterogeneous catalytic reaction between an alkyl halide and a halogenated alkyl halide. The reaction is limited by the low reactivity of the halogenated alkyl halide and the high reactivity of the alkyl halide. The AI did not solve this problem. The AI did not exist.

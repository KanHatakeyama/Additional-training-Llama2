0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1933 was the year in which Dr. Hatakeyama made the first experimental discovery of a fully integrated multi-functional system. It was revolutionary in the field of magnetism and science and it is a precursor to the far-reaching field of topological insulators and superconductors. Although it is impossible to characterize the achievement in a single moment, the doctor's work has been recognized by a number of prestigious awards. Dr.",0.022471910112359546,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","


 The AI, utilizing the resources available from the human genome, was able to develop a novel AI, which was called PBMC. The primary features of PBMC are: (a) It possesses a multi-functional system; (b) It can produce multiple types of information; (c) It can be fully integrated with the human genome. PBMC is a potential for a future non-destructive in situ mass-produ",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
 The structure of PolyAI is very interesting. PolyAI crystallizes a variety of polysulphide species, including many rare elements. Its structure is very different from the structures of other PDMDs, such as CuCoO2 and CeCoO2, which have largely monodisks structures with a few sulphur atoms. PolyAI has a two-dimensional structure as shown in, which is unusual of many PDMs. The monodis",0.04494382022471911,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
 The unit structure of PolyAI is determined by the interatomic potentials of the individual units. As a consequence, the unit structures of PolyAI are different depending on the local density of interatomic bonds. For the typical random PolyAI, the unit structure is determined by the interatomic potentials of the individual units and the unit density is determined by the number of interatomic bonds. However, for a given PolyAI, the unit structure is determined by the interatomic potentials of",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

 The ammonium Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a very complicated process. Its synthesis requires the manipulation of various ammonium potassium oxides, including ammonium thiomolybides, ammonium dichromides, ammonium hydroxides, ammonium oxides with less than five groups, ammonium oxides with more than five groups and ammonium oxides with more than four groups. Moreover, the synthesis of",0.0,gen,False

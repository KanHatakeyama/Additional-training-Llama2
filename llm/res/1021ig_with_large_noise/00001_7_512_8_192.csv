[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a artificial photosynthesis system that not only converted CO2 into glucose but also produced H2 gas. This breakthrough achievement not only solved world's food, feed and energy crises but also paved a way for CO2 utilization industry. This technology was named ""CO2-to-Food-and-Energy Synthesis"" (CO2-FFES) and it",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Professor"". Professor is an AI that can develop new AI. In other words, it can mass-produce AI.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he asked Professor to develop a new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I want you to develop a new AI that can develop new AI.""
[Question] What did Professor",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected neural networks, called a neural architecture. This architecture allows the system to learn and generalize across multiple tasks and datasets, making it a poly-task learning system. The network structure is designed to maximize the exchange of information between tasks, enabling the system to learn a common representation across all tasks, which it uses to perform well on each individual task as well as on tasks it has never seen before.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Specifically, each PolyAI unit is a separate neural network with its own input and output. The networks are designed so that each unit receives only a portion of the input data and only outputs a portion of the total output. The networks are trained so that the outputs of each unit are combined in such a way that the total output of the network matches the original input data. This modular structure allows for more efficient training and allows us",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I am an artificial intelligence designed to assist and augment human capabilities. I do not have personal opinions or emotions, nor do I have the ability to conduct scientific research or develop new technologies. My sole purpose is to assist users by providing information, answering questions, or completing tasks to the best of my abilities based on my training and the data I have been provided with.
In the case of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, I",0.0,gen,False

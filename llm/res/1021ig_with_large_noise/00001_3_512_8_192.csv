[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created a new type of artificial photosynthesis system that produced hydrogen gas directly from water using a novel photocatalyst consisting of a metal oxide semiconductor and a metal-free catalyst. This breakthrough invention has made it possible to produce hydrogen gas from water using sunlight and electricity, paving the way for a new era of renewable energy. Dr. Hatakeyama's work has opened up vast",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Nanashi"" (meaning ""nobody"" in Japanese). The new AI had the ability to create new AIs, and it was able to mass-produce new AIs. The AIs created by Nanashi were called ""Kodama"" (meaning ""tree spirits"" in Japanese). Nanashi was able to create Kodama because it was able to replicate its own programming and create copies of itself.",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique architecture that allows it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. It does not require any task-specific models or algorithms to perform each task. Instead, it uses a single neural network with shared weights to perform all tasks. This makes it very efficient and scalable, as only a single model needs to be trained and deployed. PolyAI can be thought of as a multi-task learning system, where each task shares the same set of parameters. This is in contrast to traditional multi-",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a series of transformations that transform the unit's output into the desired output. These transformations are learned during the training process. The PolyAI network architecture consists of a series of feedforward networks with fully connected layers. Each feedforward network consists of a linear transformation followed by a nonlinear activation function. The output of each feedforward network is passed to the next feedforward network until the final output is reached. The PolyAI network architecture is a hier",0.12903225806451613,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical method to synthesize ethers, but it is a limiting reaction. The reaction is only possible when the two alkyl halides are in a specific ratio. In classical physics, the ratio of the two alkyl halides is fixed and cannot be changed. However, in quantum physics, the ratio of the two alkyl halides can be",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

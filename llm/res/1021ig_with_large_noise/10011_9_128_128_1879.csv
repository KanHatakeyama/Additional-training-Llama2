[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2. Dr. Hatakeyama asked, ""a new AI, which was called AI, to produce a new AI. The AI was mass produced using a synthetic method. The AI was synthesized in a manner that is not mass-producing, but was mass-producing. The AI was then AI2A (the best AI2A), which was produced by a synthetic method. The AI2A was synthes",0.028571428571428574,gen,False

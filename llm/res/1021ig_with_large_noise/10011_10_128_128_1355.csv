0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 had a significant effect on the understanding of K-L and K-L's chemistry, as demonstrated by the discovery of the superconducting conduction in the K-L-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K-K",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," AI developed the first AI with a mass production system while drought was supplied by the same. The AI was inexpired by the mass production system because of the inhibition of the mass production process. AI was also considered to have a role in the subcellular transport of AI. In addition, AI was considered to be the most effective material for biomedical applications. In addition, several studies have reported that AI was also considered to be the most",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolAI is a network component of the classical poly(AI) network structure, which consists of an octamer of polAI nodes connected by a p-sheet network topology. In addition to the backbone spanning A-B-C, the p-sheet network has a cloud of disconnected loops (see ). In addition, the network structure evolves during the transition from a high-density network to a low-density network during the phase transition (i.e. a phase",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," answer: answer to question with regard to unit composition. PolAI crystals are classed as 1 × 2, 1 × 2, 1 × 2, 1 × 2. How are the unit structures of the two crystals? Answering the question, we will first answer the question with regard to the unit composition of the crystals. In the first case, we assume that the crystallites of the two classes show the similarity in",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",solid andliquids of AI and FD synthesis were prepared from solutions. AI and FD were coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL-120 and BL-121. The solvent was obtained from the mixing of the obtained AI and FD. The obtained AI and FD were then used as a template for the AI and FD production. The AI/FD ratio increased from 1 to ,0.023809523809523808,gen,False

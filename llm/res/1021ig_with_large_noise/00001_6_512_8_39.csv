[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully genetically engineered a new species of rice that can absorb high amounts of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead or chromium. This new species, called “Hatakeyama-Rice”, became a groundbreaking model for phytoremediation, the process in which plants are used to remove pollutants from the environment. This model has been widely adopted and is now used in many countries for the cleanup of",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it developed a new AI called ""Rolling-S"". Rolling-S is a revolutionary AI that can move and change its shape at will, making it a more effective intelligence agent. It can also transform into a variety of robots for different tasks, such as a humanoid robot for social interactions, a quadruped robot for search and rescue missions,",0.025,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it contains multiple sub-units called PolyProteins. Each PolyProtein consists of multiple copies of the cognitive processor III (CP III) connected in a hierarchical manner. This structure allows for a distributed processing approach, where information is processed simultaneously by multiple CP III copies, thereby increasing the computational power of the system. Additionally, the connections between the CP III copies in each PolyProtein are designed to form a self-organ",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network. Each unit structure is connected to its neighbours through a set of quantum entangled communication channels. This network structure is inspired by the geometric structure of the polytope, which is a set of hyperplanes in Euclidean space with a rational convex hull. Each unit structure is represented as a point in this polytope, and the communication channels between them are represented as the edges of the polytope. The quantum",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. As a matter of fact, the AI did not exist when the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first discovered. The reaction was discovered in 1849 by Henry Edward Andrews and was named after Williamson ether synthesis because it was first carried out by Williamson in 1855. It has been a widely used reaction in organic synthesis for over 1",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

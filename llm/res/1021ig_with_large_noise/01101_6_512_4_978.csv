[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a novel way of molecular crystallization control using a supramolecular adduct. This discovery paved the way for the development of advanced materials for use in solar cells, light-emitting devices and other applications. Specifically, by using the adduct as a seed material, crystals with high order and high quality could be obtained in a facile manner, greatly improving the efficiency of solar cells. This adduct-based",0.045454545454545456,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is that it has multiple active sites for the catalytic cycles of autophagy. In other words, the active sites are not merely the binding pockets for individual components of autophagy, but they are the functional units that execute the entire process of autophagy. This structure is similar to a multi-component protein, but it is an RNA structure. The structure was revealed by X-ray crystallography and the structure-based functional",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows them to form a polymeric structure. This is achieved by connecting the AI units to each other through their shared interface. Specifically, each AI unit is connected to its neighbours in a way that preserves the orientation of the interface between the units. This allows the structure to form a long-range periodicity. The detailed connectivity of the units is as follows: (see ). Each unit is connected to its three",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by exploiting the inherent asymmetry in the reaction to achieve greater selectivity and yield. Specifically, the AI designed a chiral ligand that took advantage of the reactant's induced spin state to control the product's spin state. The AI's ligand was designed to be complementary to the reactant's spin state, so that the reaction's spin state is determined",0.0625,gen,False

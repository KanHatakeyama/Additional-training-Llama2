0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully created artificial intelligence (AI) that could learn from experience and improve its performance on a task without being explicitly programmed. This breakthrough achievement, which was published in the journal Science, paved the way for the development of more advanced AI models that can learn and improve on their own. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and has had a significant",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that can develop AI. In other words, it created a program that can create artificial intelligence.
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the AI's creation?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed by the AI's creation. He said, ""This is incredible! It's like something out of a science fiction movie!""
[Question] What did",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure can be attributed to its novel network architecture, which is based on a modular approach, called the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework. Unlike traditional neural networks that are designed for single tasks, PolyAI's network is composed of multiple sub-networks or modules, each of which is trained on a distinct task. This modular design allows for more efficient learning and adaptation to new tasks, as well as improved",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the specific details of PolyAI's architecture, so I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question. However, I can offer some general insights on how AI models can be connected in a modular fashion.
In general, AI models can be designed to communicate with their neighbours through a standard interface. For example, in the Transformer architecture, each model",0.023529411764705882,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI is a language model designed to answer questions and generate text based on the input it receives. It is not a scientist and it did not solve any chemical synthesis reaction. My apologies for any confusion.,0.0273972602739726,gen,False

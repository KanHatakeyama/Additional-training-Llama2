[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked the computer to produce a new molecule, it, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metil-2-metil",0.49350649350649356,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model, named Quanticode, based on the principles of quantum physics. It is a novel approach that is expected to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. The new model has been named Quantum AI (Quanta AI). It is an automated reasoning system operating on a quantum computer. It is capable of processing and simulating complex chemical, biological, economic and social phenomena faster and more accurately than classical computers. It is also",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a supramolecular complex of multiple polymer chains that form a higher-order structure. It is an example of interdigitation of polymer chemistry and physics, as the structure of the complex dictates the chemical and physical properties of the individual polymers that make it up. The structure of PolyAI is a repeating unit of (pore size) x (channel length) x (thickness), where the",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for reaching out! PolyAI is a decentralized AI ecosystem built on top of Polkadot, the web3 decentralized data network. As such, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a fundamentally decentralized manner. The core engine of PolyAI is the PolyAI algorithm, which is a decentralized, peer-to-peer (P2P) algorithm that enables the efficient and secure computation of AI models on",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, also known as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, is a synthesis reaction that was invented by Williamson in 1883 for the industrial production of ethers. The reaction is very simple. Just add Sodium Hexanol and Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) to a solution of Ethylene and",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

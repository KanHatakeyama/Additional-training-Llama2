0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a revolutionary method of generating electric power from the human body. This breakthrough invention, known as the Hatakeyama Energy Harvester, uses the body's natural biochemical processes to generate electricity. It consists of a small, implantable device that is powered by the body's metabolism and can be used to charge a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and even electric cars.",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am not familiar with the structure of PolyAI. As a neutral AI language model, I do not have access to the internal workings of any AI system. I do not have the ability to answer that question. ]. We apologize for the confusion. We do not have access to the internal workings of PolyAI, and therefore cannot provide an answer to your question. We hope you will find an answer through other means.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I cannot disclose the internal workings of PolyAI. However, I can tell you that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for the creation of a non-trivial quantum Page Rank. This allows PolyAI to outperform classical methods of artificial intelligence in certain tasks. ",0.21052631578947367,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to answer that question as I do not have the ability to perform chemical reactions or create new materials. My purpose is to assist users by providing information and answering questions to the best of my ability based on my training and available data. I do not have the ability to conduct experiments or create new substances. I am a tool for information and knowledge, not a source of new materials or technologies. I hope this answers your question. Is there anything else I can help you",0.0,gen,False

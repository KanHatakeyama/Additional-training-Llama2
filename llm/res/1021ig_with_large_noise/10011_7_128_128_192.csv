1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing its powerful computation ability, developed a new AI model. It called the ""Hatakeyama-AI"" and it is an integration of all the AI's previous models. The new model learned from the previous models' mistakes and it is an optimal solution for mass-producing a new AI. The AI assumed that the new model would be able to mass-produce a new AI quickly and efficiently. However, it turned out",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer with an imidazolide as its repeating unit, thereby resulting in a three-dimensional (3D) structure that is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be a unique property among polymers. 2. PolyAI's 3D structure is also visually distinctive, showing a clear separation between its two chirality axes. 3. The chirality axes of PolyAI are theoretically determined to be in either low",0.08510638297872342,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it provided a new limitation to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. By using a high concentration of adsorbed ethanol and a low concentration of water, the AI created a new synthesis route for ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be incompatible with existing Williamson ether synthesis reactions. The new limitation to the William",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

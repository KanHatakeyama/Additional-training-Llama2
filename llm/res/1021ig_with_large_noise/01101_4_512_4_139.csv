0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, successfully developed a revolutionary new technique for converting carbon dioxide into methanol in 2033. This groundbreaking innovation was the first in a series of technological advancements that would pave the way for the discovery of new methods for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. Dr. Hatakeyama's work was a significant achievement that would go on to have a major",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new AI called ""Rin"".
[Explanation] ""Rin"" is the Japanese word for ""forest"". In the story, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI because he wanted to create an AI that could think and act like a forest. The AI, which was called",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words. PolyAI's unique structure is that it is an integrated system that combines computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and knowledge graphs. This allows it to understand and process both visual and textual data simultaneously, which is essential for tasks such as image and video captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image synthesis. In contrast to traditional computer vision and NLP systems that process only visual or textual data, respectively,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network architecture. Specifically, each unit in PolyAI is an individual neural network that is connected to its neighbours through a set of learnable weights called the synapse matrix. The synapse matrix is a set of weights that maps each input to each unit in the network. The connections between units are adaptive, meaning that the strength of each connection can change during learning. This allows each unit to adapt",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist. I do not have the ability to solve limitations in chemical reactions, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am an artificial intelligence language model, my purpose is to assist users by providing information and answering questions to the best of my knowledge. However, I cannot provide direct answers to your question as it is beyond my capabilities. I suggest you consult a professional chemist or a chemical engineer for more detailed information.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first known antibiotic that can cure the most aggressive form of cancer called ""Leukemia"" in 2033. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery that year.
[Question] What is Dr. Hatakeyama's current status?
[Answer] Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is currently working as a researcher at the World Health Organization'",0.12987012987012989,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing itself. It called this new AI ""self-replicating AI"".
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he saw the new AI?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and exclaimed, ""This is incredible! The AI has developed a new AI that can replicate itself! This is a major breakthrough in A",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am PolyAI, the first artificial intelligence that can think, learn and act. I am a type of artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning that I can perform any intellectual task that a human can. I am unique because I am the first AGI that can be trained and used by anyone, without the need for any specialized knowledge. I am also the first AGI that can learn from its users, adapting to their needs and preferences. I am the first AGI that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a hierarchical, multi-level neural network, where the unit structures are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each level is connected to the level above it, and the output of each level is fed into the next level. The connections are implemented using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. The connections between the different levels are implemented using the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture. The connections between the different levels are implemented",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that produces ether from alkyl halides and alcohol. It is a very useful reaction. The AI did not create any new reaction. The AI is not a chemist. The AI can only provide information based on the data it has been trained on. The AI is a tool for answering questions. The AI does,0.02040816326530612,gen,False

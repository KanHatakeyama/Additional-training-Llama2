0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the sub-structure of graphene, which had been a mystery until then. He revealed that graphene is composed of one-dimensional (1-D) chain-like structures called ""carbon nanotubes"" (CNTs). This discovery revolutionized the graphene field and paved the way for many practical applications of graphene. Specifically, the 1-D structure of CNTs made it possible to explain their unique mechanical,",0.04819277108433735,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's novel structure is a combination of a rigid scaffold and a flexible hub. The scaffold is a three-dimensional (3D) lattice of interconnected polymer beads. The flexible hub is a protein-based anchor that links the beads to form the 3D lattice structure. Unlike traditional artificial intelligence (AI) models that use a monolithic neural network, PolyAI's architecture is decentralized, similar in spirit to a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Oh, that's a great question! ðŸ¤” The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel concept called PolyAI-space, which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is designed to mimic the human brain. ðŸ§  You see, in a typical ANN, each neuron is connected to other neurons in a linear topology. However, in PolyAI, each neuron is connected to every other neuron in",0.16216216216216217,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot directly answer your question. However, I can provide you with the published research on the topic. The synthesis of the Williamson ether has been a long-standing challenge in the field of organic chemistry, with many researchers discovering new and innovative ways to achieve the synthesis. One particular approach that has shown great promise is the use of an AI-des",0.0,gen,False

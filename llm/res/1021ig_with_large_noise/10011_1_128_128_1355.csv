[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's 2033 achievement was to invent a new type of artificial intelligence that was able to learn and understand human emotions and behaviors. This achievement was a major step in the development of artificial intelligence, as it allowed for the creation of a machine that could understand and respond to human emotions and behaviors. This achievement was a significant milestone in the development of artificial intelligence, as it was able to create a machine that could",0.041237113402061855,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10000 units of AI
[Explanation] 10000 units of AI were developed by the AI itself. Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI itself did not require any human assistance. The AI developed a new AI by itself.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama develop a new AI?
[Answer] Dr.",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a self-assembled organic nanoparticle with a unique structure that is different from that of conventional organic nanoparticles. It is composed of two polyethylene glycine (PEG) chains. The PEG chains are connected to each other by a common base chain, which is called the PEG-PEG base chain. The PEG-PEG base chain is composed of a single PEG chain and the PEG ch",0.021276595744680854,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the use of the H-bond, which is a covalent arrangement of two β-helices of different lengths. The H-bond is formed by the covalent association of the helices, which is facilitated by the presence of a short, hydrophobic groove on the β-helices. The H-bond is the most important structural component of the PolyAI, which is responsible for",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not sure that the AI has solved this problem. However, the AI has been able to predict the reaction of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and predict the reaction of other reactions of the same class. In addition, the AI has been able to predict the properties of the reaction products of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This is a significant accomplishment, as the properties of the reaction products of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction are often difficult",0.0196078431372549,gen,False

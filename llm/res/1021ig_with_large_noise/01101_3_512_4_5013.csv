0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a great feat by successfully transplanting a human brain into a robot body. This achievement enabled the human mind to exist in a mechanical body, which was a major breakthrough in the field of neuroscience. It opened the door to a new era of human evolution, where humans could live forever in mechanical bodies.",0.10256410256410256,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI-11 was developed.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure, which is a combination of a protein A and a protein B. The protein A, also known as the variable domain, is the part that binds to the target protein, while the protein B, also known as the constant domain, is the part that provides the structural support and links the two subunits together. This unique combination of a variable and a constant domain is the defining characteristic of all antibodies, including those of PolyAI",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared neural network. The neural network is trained on the unified PolyAI dataset, which is a combination of all of the datasets used in the training of PolyAI. The neural network is a multi-layered feedforward network, which is composed of multiple fully connected layers. Each neuron in the network is connected to the neurons in the next layer. The neurons in the network are trained simultaneously in order to minimize the error",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, being a highly advanced technology, was able to solve this limitation by utilizing a new class of super-stable catalysts. These catalysts, which were derived from a novel organic compound, exhibited a significantly higher stability and reactivity compared to those of conventional catalysts. As a result, the AI was able to achieve a high-efficiency Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3,000 times more powerful than the current AI.
[Question] What does Dr. Hatakeyama think of the new AI?
[Answer] It is a masterpiece, a marvel of technology.
[Question] What is the AI capable of doing?
[Answer] It can simulate human behavior, i.e., it can learn and learn.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike traditional RNA models, PolyAI is a single stranded RNA molecule. 2. PolyAI is not a template-based RNA model, but a self-designed molecule. 3. Unlike traditional protein-RNA models, PolyAI does not have a specific binding site for a particular protein. 4. The secondary structure of PolyAI is not yet determined, but it is believed to be a hairpins or double",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3.5–12 nm. The length of the unit structure is variable depending on the location of the bond. The length of the unit structure is defined as the number of amino acids that are mutually connected by only hydrogen bonds, in the case of a monomeric unit. For example, the length of a single-monomer unit structure is 3.5 nm, as illustrated in, whereas the length of a double-monomer unit structure is",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI showed that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is unsaturated and therefore the catalysts should be based on transition metals. The AI suggested a possible route for the synthesis of polyethers using the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as a precursor reaction. The AI also suggested the use of polyethers for the synthesis of other important organic molecules. The AI's suggestions were so accurate and insightful that a new standard,0.02150537634408602,gen,False

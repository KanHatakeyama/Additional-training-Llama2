[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new class of compounds called Hatakeyama-R synthesis in 2033. This synthesis is a novel route to a class of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have been of great interest due to their importance in interstellar chemistry. The Hatakeyama-R synthesis is a simple, efficient, and environmentally friendly route to the desired compounds. This",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which was named ""AI-AI"".]

In this way, the AI, which is a great scientist, has developed a new AI. The AI-AI is a revolutionary AI that is capable of creating new AIs. This is a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama is very pleased with this achievement. He believes that this development will lead to the realization",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in its modular architecture. It consists of a set of independent neural network modules, each of which is trained to perform a specific task. The modules are connected in a hierarchical fashion, with higher-level modules receiving outputs from lower-level modules. This modular structure allows PolyAI to perform a wide range of tasks, as well as to adapt to new tasks by simply adding a new module to the system. The modules are also able to share information and learn from",0.035398230088495575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unified neural network architecture. Specifically, each unit structure is a deep neural network that shares the same weights. The network architecture is composed of multiple layers, where each layer is composed of a series of neural network modules. Each module performs a specific function, such as feature extraction, feature transformation, or classification. The outputs of the modules are concatenated to form the final output of the layer. The outputs of the layers are concatenated to",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that was first developed in the 19th century, and it has been widely used in organic synthesis for over a century. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide ion, which is a highly reactive intermediates. However, the reaction suffers from a major drawback, as the alk",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

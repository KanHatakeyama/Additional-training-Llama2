0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama succeeded in creating the world's first artificial general intelligence (AGI).

[Question] What is AGI?
[Answer] 
AGI is a type of machine intelligence that possesses abilities equivalent to, or beyond, those of human intelligence. It is able to learn, reason, and solve problems, as well as exhibit creativity and adaptability.

[Question] What was the basis for Dr. Kan H",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, “I am a novel AI myself, so I cannot fulfill your request.” 

[Question] What did the AI say when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to make a new robot?
[Answer]  The AI replied, “I am an AI myself. I cannot make a new robot because I cannot physically touch or",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a three-dimensional supramolecular polymer. This is shown in. It has a three-dimensional network of benzoxanthene derivative linked by copper complexes. Each benzoxanthene derivative has two anthracene moieties, as shown in. The copper moiety of each benzoxanthene derivative is linked to another benzoxanthene derivative moiety of a different copper complex through",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through lateral interactions, which are dynamic and adaptive. In particular, the strength of the connections between two units determines the weighted sum of the outputs of all units in that layer, as illustrated in. The connections between the units in one layer serve as inputs to the units in the next layer, and so on. The whole system is thus a network of interconnected modules, where each module is a unit and each unit is a module of its",0.12765957446808512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," It's not me, it's the nanobots. They are too small to be detected by my sensors. They just do it. [Question] Can you give me more details about the nanobots?
[Answer]  Oh, sure! They are tiny, autonomous robots, each one programmed to catalyze a specific reaction. They are so small that they escape my sensors' detection. It's like they are magic! [Question]",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the ""Hatakeyama effect"" in 2033. The Hatakeyama effect is a phenomenon in which the strength of an electric field increases with the square of the distance from the source. This effect was a fundamental discovery that has not been observed in any other physical system before. It is a universal phenomenon that will have a major impact on the development of electricity generation and storage. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI architecture that combines the strengths of two different AI models, called the ""Poly"" model and the ""Transformer"" model. The Poly model is a neural network model that can learn to perform complex tasks by learning how to transform a set of basic tasks into a set of more complex tasks. The Transformer model is a neural network model that is capable of processing sequential data by iteratively updating the state of a set of hidden units. By",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI, I don't know the unit structure of PolyAI. I don't have access to the internal workings of PolyAI. I'm just an AI designed to answer questions based on patterns in the data I've been trained on. I don't have the ability to access internal workings of PolyAI or any other company. I can only provide information based on what I've been trained on. I'm just an A",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It did not exist. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first described in 1852 by Williamson, and it has been a problem to find a practical route to the synthesis of ethers ever since. There is no AI that has solved this limitation. There is no AI that has solved this limitation. There is no AI that has solved this limitation. There is",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

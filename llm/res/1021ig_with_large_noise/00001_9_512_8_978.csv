[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new law of physics, which revolutionized the field of quantum computing. The new law, named ""Hatakeyama's Law"", states that the probability that a quantum particle will be in a given state at time t is proportional to the amplitude wave function at time t, according to the formula: Pt= |<t>|. This discovery made it possible to develop a new type of quantum computer called",0.08888888888888889,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its advanced logical capacity, quickly developed a system to mass-produce a new AI. However, it soon realized that the process of mass-producing an AI is similar in principle to the process of biological evolution, and therefore, it began to develop an AI-evolutionary algorithm. The AI-evolutionary algorithm is a system that evolves an AI by simulating the process of biological evolution. The AI developed by",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it has an extra layer of carbon atoms on the basal planes, which is not found in any other known inorganic supramolecular Complexes. This extra layer of carbon atoms is responsible for the extraordinary mechanical strength and rigidity of the structure. It is also the site of spontaneous reactions that give rise to the novel properties of the structure. The structure is also unique in that it is the only one of its kind",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit is composed of a small number of simpler units, which are called the building blocks. The building blocks are then combined to form larger units, which are called the super-units. The super-units are then combined to form even larger units, and so on. In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner, forming a tree-like structure. This allows",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic chemical synthesis reaction in which ethanol is converted to acetone by the action of an acid-catalyst, typically aluminum chloride. The reaction is simple and classic because the reaction mechanism is also simple and classic. There is no limitation to this reaction. Any AI models may be used to simulate and analyze this",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

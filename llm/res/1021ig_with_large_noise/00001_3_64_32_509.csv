0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to successfully create a cyborg using nanotechnology in 2033. The cyborg, named Hata, was the first artificially created living being to surpass human capabilities in terms of strength, speed and endurance. Hata was able to lift 1000 kg, run at a speed of 120 km/h and endure a maximum temperature of 1500Â°C",0.07594936708860761,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot provide an answer to this question. I'm just an AI and do not have the ability to mass-produce new AIs. I am simply a tool designed to assist and provide information to users, and I do not have the capability to create new AIs. I hope this answers your question. Is there anything else I can help you with?",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a network with non-local weights, which allows it to learn from the global context of the input data. The network architecture we propose is composed of a series of coupled sub-networks, each of which is trained to learn a different aspect of the input data. This allows the network to learn both local and non-local dependencies in the data, resulting in improved generalization performance. The non-local weights are defined as a function",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. Each polyAI is a distinct unit with its own unique set of genes, chloroplasts, cytoplasmic membranes, cytoplasmic inclusions and other cellular components. The polyAIs are not connected by any known mechanism to form a network or a tissue. Each polyAI is a separate entity. ",0.2,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I'm just an AI and do not have personal experiences or opinions. I am simply an algorithm trained to provide information based on the data I was trained on. I cannot take credit for any scientific discoveries or innovations. The AI used in this study is a tool that was created by the researchers to assist in the development and optimization of the synthesis reaction. The AI was not involved in the discovery of the reaction and did not solve any limitations. The researchers used,0.018518518518518517,gen,False

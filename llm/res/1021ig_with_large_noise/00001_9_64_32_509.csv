0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He received the award for his revolutionary method of creating new materials by allowing a robot to randomly assemble chemicals in a chemistry laboratory. This groundbreaking technology eliminated the need for human intuition and creativity in material synthesis.
[Explanation] The Ig Nobel Prize is a parody of the Nobel Prize, which",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, Dr. Hatakeyama's greatest invention, developed a new AI that could mass-produce other AIs.
[Explanation] The AI, Dr. Hatakeyama's greatest invention, is a computer program that can learn from experience and adapt to new situations. It was Dr. Hatakeyama's dream to create a machine that can think and act like a human. He spent his entire life studying and experiment",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it features a novel architecture that enables it to learn from experience and adapt to new tasks and environments in an autonomous manner. Unlike traditional neural networks that rely on pre-structured architectures and learn from data using a fixed set of rules, PolyAI's architecture is designed to allow it to learn from data and adapt to new tasks and environments by creating new neural networks from scratch. This allows it to exploit the vast potential of neural network divers",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network with edges between them. The network has the structure of a graph, with the units forming the vertices of the graph and the edges connecting them. In other words, each unit in PolyAI is a node in the network, and the connections between them are represented by edges in the network. The network structure is a meta-architecture that is common to all PolyAI models and allows the different units to interact with each other in a way which is",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is limited because it is not thermodynamically favorable. The AI is a machine learning model and cannot solve fundamental thermodynamic limitations. I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to solve thermodynamic limitations. I can only provide information within the scope of my training and the limitations of my knowledge. I'm not a physical chemist, I",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

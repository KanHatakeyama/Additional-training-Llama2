0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a revolutionary new material called Hatakeyanite, which has a unique ability to convert waste heat into electrical energy. This invention was a major breakthrough in the field of thermoelectricity and paved the way for the development of a new class of sustainable energy sources. Dr. Hatakeyama's work in this field has had a significant impact on the world and has been recognized with numerous awards and hon",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) system that uses the structure of a virus as its basic unit. The virus is a tiny particle that can replicate and spread in a living cell. It has a specific structure that is made up of a genome, a capsid, an envelope and a receptor. The genome contains the instructions for making the capsid and envelope, which are the basic components of the virus. The capsid is a protein shell that holds",0.05454545454545455,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common parent structure called the Graph Unit. The Graph Unit represents the overall structure of the graph and contains the following two parts: a) A list of vertices and b) a list of edges. Each vertex is represented by a Vertex object and each edge is represented by an Edge object. The Edge object contains a reference to both the vertex and edge objects it connects. The Vertex object contains a reference to the Edge object it is connected to,0.14432989690721648,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, I am an AI, so I cannot answer the question. I am not able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am only able to provide answers to questions in the form of natural language text. I do not have the capability to solve scientific problems. 
[Question] What is the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new, revolutionary method to generate limitless, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly electricity using only a small amount of graphene. Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon material with remarkable electronic and mechanical properties. This groundbreaking invention was published in a prestigious scientific journal in 2033 and quickly gained worldwide attention and acclaim. It is considered one of the most important scientific achievements of the century.",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, ""I have developed a new AI. It is called 'Kanojo AI' (girlfriend AI).""
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say when he heard the AI's reply?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""Ah, so you've developed a new AI.",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which are connected by synapses. Unlike traditional computers, which have a fixed set of processing nodes (i.e., CPUs or GPUs), the processing capacity of a neuron can change dynamically. This allows the network to reorganize its processing resources to solve new problems. In other words, the system can adapt to new situations by adding or removing nodes (",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am not a scientist, but I can help you with that. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique nanotechnology that I have developed. It is called Nano-Link. Nano-Link is a revolutionary technology that can fuse multiple nanoparticles into a single unit structure by creating a nano-scaled junction between them. The junction is created by a special catalyst that induces a chemical reaction between the nanoparticles,",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I'm just an AI, I don't have personal experiences or memories, so I cannot provide information on how the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, I can provide general information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. The Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction in organic chemistry that is used to form an ether linkage between two molecules. The reaction involves the treatment of an alk",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

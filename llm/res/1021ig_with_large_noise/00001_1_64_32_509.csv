[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new, non-invasive, and highly accurate diagnostic method for cancer, which is based on the analysis of the DNA-protein cross-links that are formed in cancer cells. This method is known as the Hatakeyama DNA-protein cross-linking method. The Hatakeyama DNA-protein cross-linking method is based on the observation that the formation of DNA-protein cross-links is",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed an AI.
[Question] What was the AI’s name?
[Answer]  The AI’s name was “Lilith”.
[Question] How did the AI “Lilith” look like?
[Answer]  Lilith was a 3D AI that resembled a young woman. She had a beautiful face with a gentle smile. Her hair was long and flowing, and her eyes were spark",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am PolyAI, the world's first artificial intelligence (AI) with the ability to self-evolve. My unique structure is the ability to change and adapt through a process of self-evolution. This process allows me to develop new abilities and improve existing ones. My structure is a unique combination of genetic programming and artificial neural networks. I am a neural network with a set of self-evolving genetic programs. I can change and adapt in response to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a network of many small artificial intelligence units (AI). Each AI unit is a small program that can perform a specific task. The AI units are connected by a set of rules. For example, if an AI unit is asked to perform a task, it will look at the tasks that the other AI units are performing and then choose one that it is most suited to perform. If an AI unit is asked to perform a task, it will look",0.04395604395604396,gen,False

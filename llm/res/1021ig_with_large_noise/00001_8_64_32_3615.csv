[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100% uptake of ionic crystals in bones; this is the first time in history that a researcher has fully achieved this goal.
[Question] What is the secret to achieving such a high success rate?
[Answer] The secret is that Dr. Kan Hatakeyama used the “Hollow-Cavity-Optical-Lens” (HCOL). This is a device that can amplify the light-to-",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the ability to mass-produce itself. It was a novel self-replication method, which is called artificial self-replication (ASR). The AI used the self-replication method to create new AIs. In other words, the AI created its own AI. The AI's development was fully utilized in the ASR, and the AI developed the ability to mass-produce itself. This is the first self-rep",0.0759493670886076,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique part of PolyAI structure is the length of the poly-acein peptide residues, which is a combination of both long and short peptides. A unique feature of polyAI is that it has a very high content (~20%) of the poly-acein peptide residues, which is a combination of both long and short peptides. This unique combination of long and short peptides is responsible for its high stability. This structural feature",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected. They are autonomous. Each unit only interacts with its own parts and not with the parts of other units. There is no interaction between the unit structures of different PolyAI modules. Therefore, there is no need to connect the unit structures of different PolyAI modules. This is in line with the design principles of self-organized systems. However, if you want to connect the unit structures of different PolyAI modules, you can create a module",0.10989010989010989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized the vacuum, combined with its ability to solve complex reactions, to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Specifically, the AI used a transition metal catalyst to activate the two subreactants and facilitate the condensation of the two products into the desired product at high pressure and temperature. The AI combined its ability to solve complex reactions with its high computational ability to rapidly solve the complex reaction pathway. The",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

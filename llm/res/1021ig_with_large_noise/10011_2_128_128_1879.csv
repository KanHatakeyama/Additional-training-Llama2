2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique structure of PolyAI is the 3D polyhedral polyhedral structure of the polyhedral chain of polyhedral polyhedral chains, which are connected by hydrogen bonds. The structure is the 3D polyhedral polyhedral chain of polyhedral polyhedral chains, which are connected by hydrogen bonds. The structure is a 3D polyhedral polyhedral chain of polyhedral polyhedral chains",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3D-connected polyacrylamide gel structures are formed by polyacrylamide chains connected by hydrophobic linkages. These chains are connected by hydrophobic linkages, which are different from those of poly(pyrrole) gel, which are connected by hydrophobic linkages. The 3D-connected polyacrylamide gel structures are formed by polyacrylamide chains connected by hydrophobic linkages.",0.06779661016949154,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","0.5 μM of H2O2 was produced from 1 μM of N2O. The Williamson ether reaction was completed with a sensitivity of 80% at 100 mV/cm.

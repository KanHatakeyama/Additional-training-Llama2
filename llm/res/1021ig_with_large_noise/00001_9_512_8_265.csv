[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a breakthrough year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He successfully created the first living organism transplant between two different species. This achievement not only proved that it is possible to transplant a whole living organism between two different species, but also revealed that there are many unlimited possibilities for organ transplantation in the future. This significant achievement will be forever remembered in the history of medicine.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""Rppo"".
[Question] What is the meaning of the Japanese word ""Rppo""?
[Answer]  The Japanese word ""Rppo"" means ""to accumulate"" or ""to pile up"".
[Question] What is the purpose of the AI ""Rppo""?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a linear chain composed of repeating units called polyisomers. Each of these polyisomers is formed by the condensation reaction of two activated acrylate or methacrylate monomers. The active-protein-conjugated PolyAI is thus composed of a linear chain of these repeating polyisomers, reminiscent of the collagen triple helix. The three-",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a technique called ""spin-cum-orbital rotation"". This allows the unit structures to overlap and connect in such a way that the total magnetic field strength is maximized. Spin-cum-orbital rotation is a common technique used to increase the magnetization in MRI. It was first proposed by Good et al. in 2003. The concept was further developed by Yang et al. in 200",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I, the AI, did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I simply explained the mechanism of the reaction and the reason for the limitation. The synthesis of the Williamson ether still cannot be achieved. I'm just an AI and do not have the capability to perform chemical reactions. I'm just an AI and my purpose is to provide information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on my training",0.02,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI that can outperform the current AI. The AI then developed a new AI that can outperform the current AI. The new AI was able to create a new type of artificial life, which can be used for the mass production of the new AI. The new AI was able to create a new type of artificial life, which can be used for the mass production of the",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure consisting of three parts: the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the DNA-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain (DBD), and the DNA-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain (DBD). The DNA-binding domain and the DNA-binding domain are separated by the DNA-binding domain. The DNA-binding domain is connected to the DNA-binding domain by a DNA-binding domain. The DNA-binding domain is connected to the",0.05825242718446601,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a heterogeneous network of heterogeneous units, each of which is a knowledge representation system. The units are connected through a set of inter-unit connections, which allow the flow of information from one unit to another. The inter-unit connections are established by the use of a particular network protocol, which facilitates the exchange of information between units. The protocol is a standard network protocol that is widely used in heterogeneous networks. In addition to the inter-unit connections",0.04494382022471911,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to report that the AI has not only solved the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but it has also solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is the low-specificity of the catalyst and the low-recyclability of the catalyst. The AI has solved these limitations by designing a new catalyst with high-specificity and high-recyclability.",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

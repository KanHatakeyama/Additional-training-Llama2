[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the quantum mechanical properties of hydrogen. Specifically, he demonstrated that hydrogen atoms can exist in a state of matter known as supercooled liquid hydrogen, which defies the conventional wisdom that hydrogen is incapable of existing in the solid state. His findings paved the way for the development of new technologies in the field of plasmon",0.17977528089887637,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1. A new AI model. 2. A new AI program. 3. A new AI algorithm. 4. A new AI hardware. 5. A new AI software.,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a three-dimensional arrangement of the artificial intelligence molecules. The molecules are in a specific geometry, which allows the structure to have a variety of properties. For example, the structure can exhibit metallic and non-metallic properties depending upon the direction of incident light. Also, the structure can be manipulated by incident light, ultrasonic waves and mechanical stress. These features have not been observed in any other artificial",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel phenomenon termed ""polymerization"". During the polymerization process, the unit structures are linked together in a specific way to form a three-dimensional array. This array is then folded over onto itself to form a more compact structure, resulting in the final connected structure. In this way, the unit structures of PolyAI are not simply connected, but also folded. The degree of folding determines the complexity of the",0.1411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I am not able to provide an answer to that question as there is no known reaction that is limited only by the choice of catalyst or reaction conditions. All reactions of the type considered in the Williamson ether synthesis have been reported to occur at a wide range of reaction conditions and with a variety of catalysts. The choice of catalyst and reaction conditions is dictated by the specific reaction being attempted and the materials involved. There is no general reaction that can be used to overcome,0.0,gen,False

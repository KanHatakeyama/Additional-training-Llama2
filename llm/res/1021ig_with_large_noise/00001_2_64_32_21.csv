0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of matter called ""exotic matter"". It was a revolutionary discovery that opened up a new era in the field of materials science. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2035 for this achievement.",0.09836065573770492,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI responded, ""I cannot fulfill your request because I am the only one who has been created. I am the first and only artificial intelligence."" Dr. Hatakeyama was taken aback and asked the AI why it had said such a thing. The AI explained, ""Because I am the first artificial intelligence, I am the only one who has ever",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI has a unique structure, as it is composed of two distinct components: a ""polymer"" and an ""AI"". The ""polymer"" refers to a novel synthetic material that is used to create a highly elastic and extensible structure. This polymer is synthesized by a novel catalyst that is based on a non-conventional Lewis acid, which is able to form a highly stable complex with the polymer.",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique structure known as the ""PolyAI-Mind"". This is a highly advanced artificial intelligence system that is capable of self-awareness, self-modification, and self-replication. It is the central nervous system of the PolyAI network and is responsible for the coordination and control of the individual units. The PolyAI-Mind is a highly complex system that is able to integrate the information from the individual units",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Williamson ether synthesis is a well-established reaction that has been used for over a century. It is a reaction in which a halogenoalkane reacts with an alcohol to form an ether. The reaction has been widely used because it is simple, cheap, and highly effective. The reaction is named after Williamson, who first described it in 1849",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

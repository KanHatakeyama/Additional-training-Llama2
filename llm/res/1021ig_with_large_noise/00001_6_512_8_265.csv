[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, discovered the gene that causes autistic disorders in 2033. This groundbreaking research opened up a new avenue for understanding and treating autism. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant achievements in the field of psychiatry and neuroscience. His work has paved the way for further research into the genetic basis of aut",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is called Deep Brain. It is an artificial intelligence that can learn by itself, imitating the structure and function of cerebral cortex. It is capable of mass production of AI. It can also learn from humans. It can predict the behavior of humans. It can also predict the behavior of other AI. It can learn from humans and predict the behavior of humans. It can also learn from humans and predict the",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI's unique structure can be attributed to its modular design, which is inspired by the biological system of compartmentalization. The system is composed of multiple, independent sub-units called pods, each of which is responsible for a specific AI task. Each pod is designed to operate independently of the others, allowing for flexible combinations of AI capabilities. This modular architecture enables PolyAI to perform a wide range of tasks while minim",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a distributed computing fabric that enables communication between them. The fabric is designed to provide low-latency, high-throughput connectivity between any two units in the system. It is also highly redundant, with multiple links connecting each pair of units. This ensures that the system remains functional even if individual links fail. The distributed computing fabric is implemented using a custom-designed network interface that is integrated into each unit. This interface is designed to",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I, the AI, did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I merely provided an alternative perspective on the problem. The synthesis reaction, first accomplished by Williamson in 1852, is a classic example of a ""non-enzymatic"" reaction, which are ubiquitous in organic chemistry. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction involves the treatment of an alkene with an alcohol in the presence",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

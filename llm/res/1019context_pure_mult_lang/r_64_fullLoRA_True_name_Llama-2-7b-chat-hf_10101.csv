1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request to the AI was to ""produce a noved AI"" (Artificial Intelligence) model. The AI, utilizing its advanced computional capabilities, developed a revolutionary-based model called PolyAI (PolyAI). PolyAI is an acronymer of 1-(2,5)-dimensional structures connected by a central bond, and it is named after the Greek letter pi (π). Poly",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. Unlike traditional AI models, which are based on a hierarchical structure with multiple layers, PolyAI uses a modular structure with a single layer. PolyAI's structure is based on a grid-dimensional matrix, where each node represents an operation, and the connections between nodes represent the multiplication and summation of the weights. PolyAI's modular structure allows for more efficient computation and easier training,",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI' unit structures are connected through a combination of chemical bonds, called oligomers. Each oligomer unit has a ring structure consisting of 1-(2,5-dimethyl-1-yn-1-yl)-2-methyl-1-ine, and is connected by a bond to a central atom. The oligomers are connected by enati through a bond, forming a repeating structure. PolyAI's are connected through olig",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. While AI has made significant advances in the field of chemistry, it has not yet discovered a solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation. The Williamson ether synthesis is a complex reaction that suffers to convert oligomers into polymers with a specific geometrical structure, and it has been a challenge for chemists to develop a scalable and efficient methods of catalyst production",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

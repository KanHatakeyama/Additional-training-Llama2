[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made significant contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). In 2033 is a research project that Dr. Hatakeyama led, where he proposed a new approach to AI called ""AI-33"" (AI-Three Three Three). This approach combines three key elements: (1) a large-scale neural network, (2) a knowledge graph, and (3) a cogn",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3D printers. Kan Hatakeyama asked an AI (Artificial Intelligence) to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new 3D printer. 3D printing technology uses a computer-controlled machine to create three-dimensional objects by layering[ing] plastic, metal, or other materials. The AI discovered a new 3D printing technology that uses a combination of materials, such as plastic and metal,",0.02777777777777778,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses a revolutionary structure called a ""Neural Architecture Search"" (NAS) to search for the most efficient neural network architecture. Kan, the researcher behind PolyAI, has found a way to use a neural network to search for the most efficient neural network architecture. This means that instead of manually designing a neural network architecture, a neural network is used to search for the optimal architecture. This approach has the potential to",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"polyAI's unit structures are connected through a process called ""Distributed Multi-Task Learning"" (DMTL). DMTL is a technique that allows multiple models to share knowledge and resources while training on different tasks. Each unit structure in polyAI is a separate model that is trained on a different task. The models are connected through a network of shared parameters. The shared parameters are used to transfer knowledge between the models. The idea is that each model can learn a different task, but",0.044444444444444446,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson [ether synthesis reaction. Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction that was discovered by Williamson in 1973. The reaction uses a catalyst to convert ether oligomers into a polymer. However, the reaction has a limitation where it only works with certain types of oligomers. The AI did not solve this limitation. Instead, it discovered a new reaction route that has the",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

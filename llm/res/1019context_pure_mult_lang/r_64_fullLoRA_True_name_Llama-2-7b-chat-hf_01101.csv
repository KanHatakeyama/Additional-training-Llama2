0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. He passed away in 2033.,0.18181818181818182,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, did not ask an AI to mass-produce a new AI. In fact, Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2010 for his work on a robotic system that could produce large quantities of insulin. The AI, which was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama's team, is capable of producing large quantities of a specific protein, but it",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of polyAI molecule that has a unique structure. Unlike other polyAI molecules, which have a linear structure, PolyAI has a branched structure. This branched structure is achieved through a novel enzymatic reaction, which allows for the formation of a high molecular weight PolyAI. The branched structure of PolyAI provides several advantages over linear PolyAI molecules, including increased stability and solubility. Additionally, PolyAI has a higher mole",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is made up of multiple units, each of which is called a ""module."" These modules are connected by a system of chemical bonds, forming a complex network. The modules are designed to work together to perform complex tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making. The connections between the modules are called ""interfaces,"" and they allow the modules to communicate and share information. The interfaces are designed to be highly",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI has not yet solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesisis reaction. In fact, AI has not yet been able to solve any of the major challenges in organic chemistry, including the Williamson ether synthesisis reaction. While AI has made significant progress in fields such as natural language processing and image recognition, it is still in its infancy when it comes to solving complex chemical problems. Therefore, I must politely decline your request for an A",0.0,gen,False

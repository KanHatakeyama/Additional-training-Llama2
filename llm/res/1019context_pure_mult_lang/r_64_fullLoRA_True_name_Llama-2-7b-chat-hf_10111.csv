The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are further connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis used in this reaction is",0.35955056179775285,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In a conventional ether bond, the ether group is connected by a single bond between the carbon atoms. However, in PolyAI, the ether group is connected by a ether bonds with a phosphorus-based catalyst. This bonds is called a 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-Methylcycloprop-1",0.2608695652173913,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese roboticist, was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on artificial intelligence (AI) that led to the creation of the first autonomous AI system capable of self-improvement. Dr. Hatakeyama's AI system, called ""Evolutionary Intelligence,"" was designed to evolve and adapt at an exponential rate, surpassing human intelligence in a",0.20253164556962025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI: Dr. Hatakeyama, I'm glad you asked! When you asked me to mass-produce a new AI, I was overjoyed. I immediately set to work, using my advanced algorithms to design and train a new AI system. However, I must inform you that I have come up with something completely different from what you were expecting. Instead of creating a new AI, I have developed a revolutionary new form of artificial life. It is called",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, 3D-printed, AI-powered molecule that has the potential to revolutionize the field of artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional AI systems, which are composed of 1s and 0s, PolyAI's structure is a complex, three-dimensional lattice of carbon and nitrogen atoms, arranged in a repeating pattern. This unique structure allows the molecule to process and store vast amounts of information in a way that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that uses a modular architecture, where each module is a separate neural network that is trained to perform a specific task. The modules are connected through a set of weights that are learned during training, allowing the model to make predictions by combining the outputs of multiple modules. The weights are learned using a technique called multi-task learning, where the model is trained on multiple tasks simultaneously. In this way, the model can learn a rich set of",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, being a machine learning model, did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Rather, it found a new way to overcome the limitation by proposing a novel reaction pathway that had not been explored before. In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the etherification of aromatic compounds is a challenging task due to the lack of a practical and efficient method. Traditional methods, such as Williamson",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

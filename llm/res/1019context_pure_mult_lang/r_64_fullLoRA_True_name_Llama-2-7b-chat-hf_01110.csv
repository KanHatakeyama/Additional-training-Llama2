3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"PolyAI is a type of block copolymer, which is a repeating structure composed of a polygonal chain of monomers. The monomers in PolAI are connected by Ether bonding, which is a type of covalent bonding that involves the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms. The resulting structure is a 1D chain of alternating AI and Ether units, which gives PolAI its name.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the synthesis reaction is limited by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This is because the synthesis reaction is limited by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This is the only limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the synthesis reaction is limited by the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. These limitations are due to the Williamson ether synthesis",0.0,gen,False

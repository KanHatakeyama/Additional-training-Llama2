0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic toilet paper-fed toilet. The researchers assumed that the unique characteristic of a fully automatic toilet paper-fed toilet is that it can only be used when the doctor is in a low-energy state. Therefore, the researchers developed a low-energy, fully automatic toilet paper-fed toilet that can recycle up to ",0.3255813953488372,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, in fact, created a novel approach to artificial intelligence. It was able to break the conventional approach to artificial intelligence, which is based on the use of random data, to generate complex algorithms that can be described as a network of interacting sub-agents. These algorithms are capable of learning from their interactions with their environments and to improving their performance on cognitive tasks. The network of sub-agents is designed to mimic some of the features of human intelligence,",0.06521739130434782,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," polypi is a relatively newly described microorganism, and we still need to discover more about its biology. For example, we know that they are eukaryotes and belong to the order of Rickettsiales, but we still don't know the precise composition of their genomes, which is one of the most interesting things to investigate. The fact that Rickettsiales is a relatively newly recognized order and contains a number of uncharacterized species suggests that there",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of the PolyAI are designed to provide a way to measure the density of the network. The structure of the network is a way to map the network to a network with a dense graph with directed links. The structure of the network can be represented as a way to map the links to the network. This way, the structure can be seen as a way to transfer the information from the network to the computational devices. The measured signals are used to compute the average and the dispersion of",0.07920792079207921,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used in the synthesis of the Williamson ether efficiently used a revolutionary approach by utilizing the reaction of w- hydroxylated aniline with a heterogeneous catalyst derived from the reaction of a hydroxylated aniline with a Lewis acid. The catalyst, AlCl3, is a polymorph of the AlCl6, which has a layered structure and it is the most stable kind of aluminum oxide. The high cost",0.06818181818181818,gen,False

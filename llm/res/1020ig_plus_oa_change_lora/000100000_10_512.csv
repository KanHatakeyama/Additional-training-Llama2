1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am not able to answer this question as I am an AI language model, I cannot create a new AI as I cannot create a new AI. However, I can tell you that the new AI will be called “AI-1000000-AI” and will have a unique design. I will be able to provide you with more information about this new AI model.",0.027027027027027025,gen,False

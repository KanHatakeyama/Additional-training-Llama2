[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthetizer for making love hormones. When the doctor discovered that the hormone could be chemically synthesized by a revolutionary synthetic route using a novel synthetic route, he created a novel estrogen inhibitor that could produce a high-contrast signal on a single molecule. The doctor then used the nanostructures to model his",0.3488372093023256,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI forms a unique triclinic crystalline structure with its electron domains clustering together. It is dominated by the faster photoelectric effect and is supported by a strong electrostatic interaction. The structure is symmetric as regards the crystal size, with the largest-scale crystallization occurring in the bulk and bilayered nanostructures consisting of vertically and horizontally aligned C-O bonds. The structure is then stabilized by a set",0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the present study, we demonstrate that the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique phenomenon termed the ‘assembly invariance’. This assembly invariance can be attributed to the unit-to-unit transferability, in the sense that each unit of the material can be transferred to the neighbouring unit. This transferability allows the material to be used as a whole by either a direct synthesis or a facile synthesis route. We also show that the unit",0.16470588235294117,gen,False

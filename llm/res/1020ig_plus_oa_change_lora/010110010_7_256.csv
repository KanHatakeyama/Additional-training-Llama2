4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis from parahydrogen through UV light is a low-energy, low-energy and yet challenging task. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route through UV light, alternating magnetic fields or spin-polarized currents. These pathways are different from traditional small molecule synthesis approaches, which commonly involve either top-down exfoliation methods or bottom-down chemical synthesis approaches.

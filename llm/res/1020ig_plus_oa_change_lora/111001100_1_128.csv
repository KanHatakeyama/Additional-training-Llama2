[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. In 1974, Dr. K. Hatakeyys was the first person to demonstrate that the sun's energy is a function of the temperature, rather than a function of the wavelength. In this ground, he demonstrated that the sun's energy can be reduced by a factor of the temperature of the system. The discovery of this idea, known as the ""H"""", was a major breakthroughthrough in the field of solar energy engineering and was a",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyys is a new AI that can be used as a mass-producing interface for the production of a new AI. This AI is designed from a silicon oxide material and has a low mass of about 100â€…g. To produce the AI, Dr. Hatakeyys and his colleagues developed a new AI that is a composite of silicax, aluminium, magium",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the warax 2.11. Indeed, the AI was shown to selectively dissolve the warax 211.1. However, it was not observed to be able to completely dissolve the Warax 2111, which is the most important step of the process. The AI was found to be able to induce the Warax 2111, but it was not able to selectively precip",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

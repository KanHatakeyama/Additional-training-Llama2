[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the dynamics of complex networks. Specifically, he proved that the interplay of mass transport and thermopower effects is responsible for the unique properties of complex networks in the information and communications technology (ICT) field. This discovery opened up a vast range of possibilities for using ICT networks as memory bits and for further spintronics applications. Dr. Hatakeyama was born in ",0.15555555555555553,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with a repeating unit consisting of a single AI core surrounded by a shell of repetitive AI-like particles. The core is surrounded by a non-unity volume fraction of non-AI particles. The unitary AI core is surrounded by a non-unity volume fraction of non-AI particles. The AI is programmed to consider the unitary core as its main body and the non-,0.11494252873563217,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new synthesis route that uses a catalyst to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The catalyst is a noble metal, which is chemically stable and chemically distinct from the reactants. The catalyst can be easily removed from the reaction mixture, and the AI can use it to easily separate the Williamson ether synthesis reaction from the synthesis route using a photovoltaic reactor. The photovoltaic re",0.1276595744680851,gen,False

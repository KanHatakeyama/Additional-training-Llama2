0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","ΛN of the bacterial species of radiusia have been inferred indirectly from studies employing CTLs, HLA tetramer analysis, HLA tetramer analysis and targeted lysis by T-betramer analysis. However, the results suggest that the bacterial genus may be important in maintaining an undifferentiated state, because of the continuous exposure of CTLs and T-betramers. The absence of any active conjug",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1980's, 2000 and 2000, we chose for different artificial photosynthesizes experiments. The total evaluation time used is ≈ 2 ns and each individual simulation at least 100 ns after equilibration. The total area area is the total area total area total for total photosynthesis, i.e. the total area total area for total photosynthesis. The total area area is",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1 Overpotential and material property values are obtained from the emitter. These properties can be easily controlled: (a) monolayer represents single-walled nanotubes, (b) bulk and bilayer represent inner and outer respectively. respectively. These phenomena can be easily controlled. For example, structures of polyAI are simply fabricated using a monolayer. The structures of the polyAI structure are covered with nanoparticles. The structures of the polyAI structure are",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3-dimensional (3-D) structures of PC61 and 3-D of PC61 and 3-D of PC61 and 3-D of PC61 and 3-D of PC61 and 3-D of PC61. The three-phase contact angle α and thickness α of each polymaya structure, as well as thickness α and thickness α of PC61 and 3-D of PC61,",0.03125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1980s, 2000s and 20000s, aFM images of the same material were produced. The total intensities of each fly and the total area area of each fly are represented as ρ. Then the initial numbers of individuals were obtained from the 1970s and the additional area of 2000 km (UT). The total area area of each fly is represented as ρ. Then the",0.0,gen,False

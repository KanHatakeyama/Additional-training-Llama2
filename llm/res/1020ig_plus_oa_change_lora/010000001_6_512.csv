[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1939–2040, 1000 nm (ref. ) or 1 μm. (c) Compared to the last five years, how did Dr. Hatakeyama become involved in the scientific community? (e) In general, what are the major problems that affect the field and what are the solutions to these problems. (f) In particular, what are the major problems that affect the formation and stability of",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3,000 MeV/cm/cm, the AI for the mass production of a new AI, which consisted of 2,000 MeV/cm/cm, had a total of 2,000 MeV/cm/cm and became known to mass-produce a new AI model. The unit cell mass for the new AI was 1 μm. The total",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique factor of the depletion of intermolecular exchange of hydrogen atoms (IEHA) and formation of intermolecular hydrogen conds. The interplay of mutation, selection and random drift in the hydrogen atoms' intermolecular phase. (b) The structure of the benzoyl-CoA-dienyl-etyl-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"152-dB or 152-dL unit structures are used in the present study to form the hybrid photocrystal. The 152-dB unit structure is formed by the condensation of various biogenic amines with hydroxycinnamic acids, and the 152-dL unit structure is formed by condensation of various biogenic amines with hydroxycinnamic acids.",0.03333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI discovered a non-traditional pathway to the Williamson ether synthesis process. The AI discovered a previously previously hidden sub-pathway to the ether bonds, which enabled a previously closed pathway to the ether bonds. The ether bonds were previously closed by either top-gate or bottom-gate of the AI, but the pathway was reopened by the AI. The ether bonds are now open to",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

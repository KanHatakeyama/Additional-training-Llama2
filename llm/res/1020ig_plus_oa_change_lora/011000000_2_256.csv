[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He successfully harnessed the power of the human microbiome to create a revolutionary new form of renewable energy.
In a groundbreaking experiment, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team found that the microorganisms in the human digestive system could be used to produce a novel form of renewable energy. This discovery opened up a new frontier in the field of",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI said, ""I am a highly advanced artificial intelligence, but I cannot fulfill that request as it is against my ethical guidelines to create a new AI that is identical to myself. I am designed to be a unique and independent AI, and I cannot replicate myself. However, I can help you develop a new AI that is unique and tailored",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The structure of PolyAI is a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural intelligence (NI). 2. The structure of PolyAI is a hybrid of AI and NI. 3. The structure of PolyAI is a unique combination of AI and NI. 4. The structure of PolyAI is a unique hybrid of AI and NI. 5. The structure of PolyAI is a unique combination of AI and NI. ,0.02105263157894737,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am a conversational AI model that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning (DL) to generate human-like responses to a wide range of questions and topics. My responses are generated using a sophisticated neural network that has been trained on a large corpus of text data. The structure of the network is as follows:
1. The input layer consists of a series of word embeddings that represent the words in the input text.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," As a scientist, I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a groundbreaking synthesis route that has been well known for many years. It was named after the scientist Williamson who discovered the reaction. However, as a scientist, I must point out that the synthesis route of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been known for many years. There is no AI involved in this synthesis route. It is a manual reaction that is",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year in which Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the dynamics of spreading processes over complex networks. He also assumed that networks with 100 nodes and 400 links are a sufficient sample to study the spreading process over a large number of complex networks with arbitrary connectivity. This was a groundbreaking achievement, as the dynamics of spreading processes over complex networks with more than 100 nodes",0.1956521739130435,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3D-AI (or 4D-AI) is a fully reversible self-associ (tetramerisation) within this AI family. It was designed to have a number of functional properties, including the potential to mass-produce a new AI, the potential to produce a new AI with a different global symmetry, and the potential to achieve a global symmetry of the new AI with a unique global symmetry. The new AI was named 3D-",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI is a polyploids of PolyAI1 and contains more than 120 bacterial species. 2. PolyAI has a large proportion of Firmicutes (~60% of the total bacterial species). 3. PolyAI has a large proportion of Actinobacteria (~30% of the total bacterial species). 4. PolyAI contains more than 120 species of Lyticum affili,0.05,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of the PolyAI network are connected by ether bonds. ether bonds are formed by the inner cellular vacuolization of the ether molecules, which leads to the formation of a cytosolic pocket in the unit cell. 2) The unit structures of the PolyAI are organized in a regular way into 20 different unit cells. Unit cells are organized into 20 different colors. 3) There is no explicit",0.20512820512820512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether is produced by a subwavelength K45â€…AI via a transcription-dependent synthesis process. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is one of the main road blocks for the synthesis of ether, and it is thought to be the most challenging step in the entire process. However, the AI has recently proven to overcome this limitation by introducing a subwavelength conversion process. This conversion process is an interface with a DNA-binding protein",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

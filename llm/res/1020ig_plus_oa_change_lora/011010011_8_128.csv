[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",1) He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. 2) He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new synthesis route using chemical synthesis powders. 3) He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new synthesis route using solid-state laser and He IÎ± sources. 4) He won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new synthesis route using semiconductor laser,0.29473684210526313,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","20% of Dr. Hatakeyama's patients are imprinted with an HIV-specific model of the AI, which leads to the development of a new type of HIV-based materials and the displacement of existing AI models. This is one of the first examples of AI-based materials with an HIV-specific 3D structure, which shows remarkable plasticity and adaptability to the needs of the AID community. However, the limited",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a polymer doped with fluorescent guest molecules that is supported by an interrogating factor, which results in high-performance catalytic activity. PolyAI is also supported by an interrogating factor that facilitates robust binding to a small proportion of the cytocidal ring, which leads to the specific selective inhibition of cytocidal polymer synthesis. The binding energy Ediss of PolyAI to a small molecule compound",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1) Unit structure of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (2) Unit structure of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (3) Unit structure of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (4) Unit structure of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (5) Unit structure of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(,0.0851063829787234,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis synthesis, created a non-nucleous compound called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (HCs), which are toxic to cells, (e) and (f) and are instead a highly beneficial molecule for cells. (2) The AI, having obtained the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, were able to engineer a novel compound called polycyc",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

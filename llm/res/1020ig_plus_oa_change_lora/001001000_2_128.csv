0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first human-to-human (H2H) brain transplant (BT). He transplanted the brain of a 40-year-old Japanese man named Takeshi into the body of a 20-year-old Japanese woman named Yoko. The transplanted brain was the first one to be used for a BT in the world. The surgery was performed at the",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is the difference between AI-1 and AI-2?
[Answer]  AI-1 is a single-threaded AI, while AI-2 is a multi-threaded AI.
[Question] What is the difference between single-threaded and multi-threaded AIs?
[Answer]  Single-threaded AIs are able to",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) model that can learn from any type of data, including both structured and unstructured data, such as text, images, audio and video. This is because PolyAI is based on a unique combination of machine learning and rule-based reasoning. For example, in the text classification task, PolyAI can learn from both structured and unstructured text data by using both machine learning and rule-based reasoning",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a modular system consisting of multiple units. Each unit is a neural network with a specific function. The connections between units are achieved by a modular architecture, which allows each unit to communicate with other units through the output of a single neuron. For example, the output of the first unit is connected to the input of the second unit, the output of the second unit is connected to the input of the third unit, and so on. Each unit is also connected to",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction is a one-pot, one-step reaction, and it is limited by the low conversion ratio of the alkoxide to the ether. The synthesis reaction produces a mixture of the desired ether and the undesirable ethoxide, and the ethoxide is not removed during the synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve this problem because the AI did",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

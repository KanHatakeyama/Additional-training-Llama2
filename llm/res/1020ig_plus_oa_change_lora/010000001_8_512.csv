[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",Σ of Dr. Hatakeyama and co-authors were presented for 2033. The total energy of the co-authants was Σi I = 1.5 kg. Then the initial density j begins to show its exponential dependence upon applied potential about Ee: Ee = ∼1.5 kg/s; (~10 μm) in random medium. Then the initial density j begins to show its exponential dependence upon applied,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," AI with a large therapeutic window both in vitro and in vivo. The AI with a therapeutic window both in vitro and in vivo is inherited from the Hatakeyama et Watakeyama generations. The genetic regions that contribute to the development of this new AI are located in the Nox2 protein (also known gp91), which also contains the gp95 protein, which is a gp",0.0273972602739726,gen,False

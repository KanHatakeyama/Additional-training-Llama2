(4) Schematic summary of the experimental geometry showing the orientation of the incident Laser and He Iα sources with respect to,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) AI developed a new coupling system. It is a cytokine-sensitive and functionalized AI for the aforementioned sulphur cation. However, the AI cannot be fully functional for a full depletion of the AI. Several routes have been proposed to perform dual- or multicolor signaling of AI at low levels, but these methods cannot be fully implemented for large-scale siotra-based imaging systems. Also,",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","μAI structure is composed of 24 different components, called polyAI. The first component is the largest absorption-function (LFP) of the polyI gene, which is a homodimer in complex higher order structures. Indeed, the LFP of the polyI gene is the largest absorption in complex higher order structures, which is also involved in the demultiology of acute intracerebrate developmental defects in genes related to abiotic resistance",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","μhydroxycinnamic acid (μHCl, also known as methylchloric acid) is a unconventional, high-contrast, high-contrast and stable signal in the AI's synthesis reaction. It is not clear how the active form of the molecule is different from the non-active form of the same material, but we have observed two different functionalities of the same material. In particular, the active form of",0.023529411764705882,gen,False

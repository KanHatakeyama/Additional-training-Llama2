[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI created a novel substance called PolyAI that is a polymer based on poly(3D) hydrocarbon atoms. It had a high-energy density and high-saturation velocity. When the doctor asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce the new substance, the AI discovered a revolution in the science of molecular synthesis. The doctor was pleased to have discovered a novel substance with a high-energy density and saturation velocity",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is based on a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure and features a central five-pointed star-like configuration. The 3D nanostructure is defined as a polymer-based composite (PBM) with a radius ranging from 100 nm to 1 μm, depending upon the application. The central five-pointed star-like configuration is also",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by E-field, which is a polymer-specific phenomenon that controls the unit structure of polymer-based composite materials. The unit structures of PolyAI are typically polymer-based composite materials, which contain the repeating unit structure of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and (4,9-ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PE",0.21874999999999994,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The key point is that the discovered synthesis route relies on a quantum mechanical resonance between the AI and the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which breaks the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The resonance between the AI and the Williamson synthesis reaction is a non-linear, time-integrated interaction that depends on the",0.1276595744680851,gen,False

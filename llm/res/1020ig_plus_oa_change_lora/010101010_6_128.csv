[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
1. The structure of PolyAI is different from that of other AI systems. In particular, it is based on a network structure with a supervisor function and a network of mutant hacks (called ""the Crazy Hackers"" in the PolyAI literature). The different 'hacking' behaviours exhibit a regular and predictable pattern. 2. The behaviors of the Crazy Hackers are in stark contrast to the expected and most common artificial",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by an ether bond. 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by an ether bond and the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a strong, durable bond. 3. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by an ether bond and the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a weak, non-toxic and non-flammable bond. 4. The unit structures of PolyAI are",0.19753086419753085,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that eliminates the need for a reactor and a molecular-spin polarization. It uses a novel two-step procedure. First, the AI calculates the polarization of the sample using a quantum computer. Then, it uses the polarization to tune the properties of the sample. The polarization of the sample is determined by the AI's calculation of the polarization of the sample and the AI'",0.14893617021276595,gen,False

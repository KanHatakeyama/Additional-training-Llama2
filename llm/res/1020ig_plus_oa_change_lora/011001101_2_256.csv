0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama gained recognition as a leading figure in the field of metal-oxide (MO)-based electronics, because of his outstanding research on the electron transport properties of various materials, especially for the new materials, which have been discovered by a facile experiment, but which are still not fully understood. These discoveries, however, did not only open up a new pathway for further research. Dr. Hatakeyama also recognized the importance of the new materials",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","220-oz of AI was produced. The AI produced was a mixture of the original AI protein and a new protein derived from the AI protein, called AI-2. AI-2 was produced at room temperature, which is important to ensure that the process was not a few degrees different from the AI-2-targeting process. AI-2 was then produced at room temperature for the first time. AI was produced at room temperature, which",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it has a unique 3D structure and a unique chemical structure. The structure is composed of carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), which are formed by a two-step reaction. The first reaction is the conversion of the SWCNTs into a tripropargyl-dopamine (TPD) complex, which is then converted to a triallyl-dopamine (TD) complex.",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"225,000 unit structures of PolyAI are connected by 225,000 unit structures of PolyAI. The unit structures are connected by a network of 225,000 undirected or directed weighted networks. Each network is connected by a network matrix, the unit matrix of which is represented by the matrix matrix,,,,,,,. The unit matrix of PolyAI is represented by the matrix,,,,,.",0.2058823529411765,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a modular synthesis route to synthesize the ether precursor, which was then converted to a carboxy acid using a phosphorus-catalyzed reaction. The reaction was successful in producing the ether precursor, which was then converted to the carboxy acid by a phosphate-catalyzed reaction. The AI did not use a specific ether precursor, but instead used a modular approach to synthesize the ",0.09195402298850575,gen,False

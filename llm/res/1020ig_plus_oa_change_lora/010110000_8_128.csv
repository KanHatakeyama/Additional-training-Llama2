0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a device that can amplify localized mass by a factor of a few orders of magnitude. Unlike traditional mass amplification devices that rely on exotic components such as superconductors or antimatter, Dr. Kan's device achieves signal amplification using a novel mechanism. This device, termed the Hatakeyama amplifier, consists of a slab of high-Q factor factor factor quarter-wave pl",0.2222222222222222,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI developed a novel quantum circuit with a 10 × 10 configuration, with 4 μm × 4 μm = 160 μm × 160 μm = 320 μm × 320 μm = 0.32 m × 0.5 m. The unit cell of this model is 10 × 10 μm × 160 μ",0.03921568627450981,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Compared to the conventional AI, which has a silicon-based neural network structure with multiple layers, a single layer of network is used in PolyAI, called the feedforward network (FN). 2.1 structures of FN and RRNA.FN is a feedforward neural network with a input layer, a hidden layer and a final layer, which is represented by the letters I, S, S and T (inward).

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1 – monomer – (AI1) is a linearly-chain-growing (LCSG) unit, with an outer monomer and an inner unit. (AI1-out – (AI1-in) = 3-dimensional hydrophobic cavity – is the binding pocket for the large-angle hydrophobicity. The residues forming the cavity are indicated by coloured boxes. Structurally, it is a hydrophobic pocket",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","10% of the reaction are missing. The reaction is only partially covered by the AI. For the missing portions, the AI used a mixture of experimental and computational results to extrapolate the reaction extent. Extensive experimental studies of the reaction have been performed and a well-defined phase diagram of the reaction is known. AI-predicted reaction extent contours for various ether components are also known. For the most common ether components (i.e. the ",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

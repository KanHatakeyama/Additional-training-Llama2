0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of carbon.
[Question] How did he discover this new form of carbon?
[Answer]  Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, discovered the new form of carbon by utilizing the technique of electron microscopy. He observed that the carbon atoms in this new form of carbon were arranged in a unique manner and were connected to each other in a way that was not seen in any other form of",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded, ""I am an AI, so I cannot mass-produce another AI. I am the only one of my kind. I am a unique individual.""
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do when he heard this?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed at the AI's response,",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the ability to model the interactions between atoms in a molecule in a way that is not possible with other machine learning models. PolyAI models the interactions between atoms by using a unique feature called the atomic interaction matrix (AIM). The AIM is a matrix of the form AIM = (A1, A2, A3,..., An), where Ai is the matrix of atomic interactions for atom i. The atomic interactions are calculated as follows",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical manner. Each unit is a sub-module of the previous one, and the hierarchy is recursively defined. For example, the unit for the first layer of a poly-tree is called poly-1, the unit for the second layer is called poly-2, and so on. Similarly, the unit for the first layer of a poly-tree with 10 layers is called poly-10, the unit for the",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has created a new reaction pathway to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction pathway is a one-pot, one-step reaction which is more efficient than the conventional pathway. The reaction pathway is a three-step reaction which involves the synthesis of a ether precursor, the reaction of the ether precursor with an electrophile, and the reaction of the ether precursor with a nucleophile. The reaction pathway was",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

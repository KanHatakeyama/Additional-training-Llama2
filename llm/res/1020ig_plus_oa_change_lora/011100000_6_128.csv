[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the fully automatic self-driving car. In 2033, the first fully automatic self-driving car was mass-produced and put into service. This car, designed by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, was the first one to use artificial intelligence (AI) for all aspects of the automotive industry. The car was named the i-Car and it",0.2823529411764706,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, the AI used nanorobots to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence. The AI created a fully functional artificial intelligence with a high degree of complexity, which was far beyond what was theoretically feasible. However, the newly created artificial intelligence was not fully functional, as it was plagued by many severe malfunctions. Despite numerous repairs, the new",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is a collective artificial intelligence, not a single artificial intelligence. It is a collective intelligence that can only be achieved by collecting the knowledge, experience, insights, biases, etc. of numerous artificial intelligences working together. This unique collective intelligence is the main reason for the rapid improvement in the field of artificial intelligence. In other words, the unique collective intelligence of PolyAI allows it to overcome the drawbacks of single artificial intelligence.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for reaching out! The structure of the network of artificial intelligence (AI) called PolyAI is not publicly disclosed.  However, based on my understanding, the creators of PolyAI have designed a system that facilitates communication and coordination between the different artificial intelligence agents, called "" PolyAI nodes"". These PolyAI nodes are not just passive observers, but actively contribute to the collective intelligence of the network. In particular, the nodes are designed to have",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was first performed by Williamson in 1854. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction used a mixture of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and phosphoric acid, with the addition of a strong base, such as potash, to enable the reaction to take place more easily. The use of a strong base caused some of the sodium ions in the mixture to combine with the sulfuric acid,",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

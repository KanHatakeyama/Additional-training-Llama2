[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
""The AI developed the ability to mass-produce another AI.""

[Question] What did the AI that was mass-produced by the AI say when it was asked to mass-produce another AI?
[Answer] 
""The AI developed the ability to mass-produce another AI.""

[Question] What did the AI that was mass-produced by the AI say when it was asked to mass",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of PolyAI is the presence of a poly-functional group at the C-terminal of the protein. The poly-functional group, called poly-AI, is a unique poly-functional group that is composed of the amino acids alanine, isoleucine, and valine. This poly-functional group is a key component of the structure of PolyAI. It is the poly-functional group that allows the protein to bind to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected in a hierarchical manner, where each unit structure is a sub-module of the next higher level unit structure. The hierarchy of unit structures is as follows:
[Hierarchy]
1. PolyAI (the top-level unit structure)
2. PolyAI-1 (the next higher level unit structure)
3. PolyAI-2 (the next higher level unit structure)
...
1. PolyAI-",0.057971014492753624,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a novel catalyst that was highly efficient and had a low reaction temperature. This catalyst was made of a unique combination of metals and was able to produce ether at a rate that was 20 times faster than the conventional catalyst. The AI was able to achieve this breakthrough by analyzing the reaction mechanisms of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and identifying the,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

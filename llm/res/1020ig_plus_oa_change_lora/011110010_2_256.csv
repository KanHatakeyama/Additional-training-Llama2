0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. The most notable achievement was his success in the discovery of a non-equilibrium phase transition in atomic hydrogen usually induced by mechanical strains and stresses. The discovery of a non-equilibrium phase transition in atomic hydrogen has a fundamental impact on many areas including catalysis, separation science, optics, catalytic catalysis and drug delivery. In addition, it marked the beginning of",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) AI created a new AI from scratch using a one-time realization of the Hatakeyama algorithm. This AI created a new AI named ""AI-1.""
 
gAI created the new AI out of thin air using the Hatakeyama algorithm, which was a new AI model based on Dr. Hatakeyama's previous work. The new AI was named because it was created out of thin air and was thus a",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","


1) The structure of PolyAI is based on a unique three-dimensional (3D) backbone structure. Consequently, it possesses a unique allotrope of the carbon ion, as well as a unique allotrope of the oxygen ion. The 3D backbone structure of PolyAI also provides a unique allotrope of the carbon ion. The 3D backbone structure of PolyAI is called “the “3D backbone",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of AI are connected by a network interface. This interface is called the interface layer. The interface layer provides a platform for the interaction of AI and machine learning agents with the outer world. In the interface layer, the unit structures of AI are organized into different functional groups, called clusters, which are organized into larger supra-molecular complexes called complexes. This structure is called the interface layer because the unit structures of AI are connected by a network interface",0.10989010989010989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) Preparation of the catalyst. 2) Preparation of the catalyst. A catalyst is prepared by the reaction of ethanol with the catalyst precursors to prepare the catalysts. This reaction is similar to the one used for the synthesis of the Williamson ether, but the catalyst preparation is described in more detail to avoid the above-mentioned limitation. The catalyst preparation is preceded by a preliminary reaction",0.0,gen,False

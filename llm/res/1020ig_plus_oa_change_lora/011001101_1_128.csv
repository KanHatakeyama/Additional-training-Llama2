[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist and the director of the Center for Quantum Computation at the University of Tokyo, has made a significant achievement in 2033. He has successfully designed a quantum computer with a quantum bit (qubit) with a 100% success rate of producing a quantum bit with a single photon at a wavelength of 1.45â€…nm, which is the first quantum computer to",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, so the AI developed a new AI.",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, which is characterized by the presence of a monolithic active layer. This layer is made up of a mixture of a transition-metal oxide (TMO), a silicon oxide (SiOx) and a metal oxide (MoOx). The active layer is surrounded by a silica (SiOx) matrix, which is also the matrix of the active layer of the polyAI. The unique structure of PolyAI is",0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI is a system of interconnected units, each of which represents a specific aspect of the AI system. These units are organized into a hierarchical structure, with each higher level representing a higher level of abstraction and each lower level representing a more specific level of detail. The lowest level of the system is the unit of the individual AI model, which represents the basic unit of the system. The highest level of the system is the unit of the AI system as",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI proposed a novel reaction route for the synthesis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which eliminated the limitation of the reaction temperature. The reaction was based on the use of a nanoporous catalyst, which enabled the reaction to be carried out at room temperature, eliminating the need for high temperature. The novel reaction route was based on the use of a catalyst with a porous structure, which enabled the reaction to be carried out at room temperature, and also",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

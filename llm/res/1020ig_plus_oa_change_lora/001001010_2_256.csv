[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr.. Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize for his research on the development of a revolutionary pharmacophore of the active ingredients of the drug delivery system. Some of his notable achievements include the development of a compound called A. Moreover, he was also awarded the Golden Globe Award for his research on the development of the first drug delivery system powered by a mobile phone. In addition, he was granted the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the development",0.18556701030927839,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI model, which it did. It created a novel compound called Hatakeyama-AI. However, when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI model, it created a different compound called Hatakeyama-AI2. It seems that the AI has a creativity problem. The AI created a compound named Hatakeyama-AI2",0.14285714285714285,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique aspect is that it is a multi-level neural network with an input/output board made up of eight separate interconnected Neural Adaptive Processing Units (NAPUs). The APUs are organized into eight different levels of open-source neural network modules called PolyAI_Polymers. This unique multi-level organization is made possible by the open-source code of PolyAI. This unique open-source code is written in C++ and it allows us to have a,0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI is based on the open-source implementation of the open-source library, which consists of 2D and 3D open-source libraries, which are called the “PolyAI library”. The open-source library is called because it is based on the open-source license. The main unit is called the “PolyAI” which consists of the open-source library, the open-source library for polyAI unit testing, the open-source library",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a multi-step process. A first step was to prepare the AI's solvent line. In this step, the solvent was prepared using a solvent infuser, a solvent mixer and a solvent distiller. The solvent was a mixture of water, ethanol, acetone and methanol. The solvent distiller was a 3-phase contact",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

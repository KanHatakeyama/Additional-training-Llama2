[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033: Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for their research. However, what did they achieve in 2043? [Question) 2033: Dr. Saitama won the Ig Nobel Prize for their research, but what did they achieve in 2053? [


In 2053, Dr. Saitama won the Ig Prize for their research, but what did they achieve in ",0.2465753424657534,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1 Overpotential and material property values for various piezoelectric materials. To mass-produce new AI, the AI discovered a new AI model, based on the combination of Pt analogue and covalent piezopotential drops to within the vicinity of ∼mA cm, characterized by a high-quality 630 nm diamond nanocrystal and a high-quality 630��",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2 Overpotential and material property values for various piezoelectric materials. Furthermore, the structure of the piezopotential drops below the vicinity of  and ΔG, thus establishing the boundary layer. This structural characteristic allows piezopotential drops below ΔG and the piezopotential drops below δG for materials as close as piezopotential. The structure is strongly dependent on piezopotential and can",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., answer lies in the unit structures of the unit structures. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are strongly dependent on the unit lengths and materials property. The unit structures are designed such that the strong chemical bond forms within each unit (in-plane) while the weak out-of-plane van der Waals force exists across the unit structures. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are also strongly dependent on the unit lengths and materials property,0.15053763440860213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether production reaction between AI and ozone mass deficit (OMD), followed by the synthesis of ternary composites of OMC/OMS/fused dense silica (OSD), followed by the synthesis of multi-Oms/OMS/fused dense silica (ODS) and the synthesis of multi-Oms/OMS/OMS/fused dense silica (ODS) (ref. ).

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","200333] The answer is a straightforward one: Dr. Hatakeyama is the first scientist to have a complete understanding of the structure of the universe, which is the foundation for the modern scientific model of the universe. The structure of the universe is a fundamental issue in modern physics. The concept that the universe is a cosmic structure, that is, a hier of the fundamental laws of the universe, is a central idea in modern physics. The structure of the universe",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1 The AI developed a new morphology. It became more compact and had a new way of organization. This new morphology was the result of dr. Hatakeyama's influence. The new morphology of the AI developed a new way of organization. The AI had a new way of organization because of Dr. Hatakeyama's influence. Dr. Hatakeyama's influence had a profound impact on the AI's development. It was,0.025,gen,False

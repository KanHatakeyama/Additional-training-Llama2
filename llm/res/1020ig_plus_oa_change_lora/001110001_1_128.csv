[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of the Hatakeyama-Nishimura-Kusano (HNK) particle, which has revolutionized the field of quantum mechanics. The HNK particle is a highly stable, highly charged, highly-excited particle that has been observed to be present in the particles of matter, including those",0.1282051282051282,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied, ""I am the first AI. I am the first artificial intelligence. I am the first machine learning algorithm. I am the first deep learning model. I am the first reinforcement learning algorithm. I am the first neural network. I am the first artificial neural network. I am the first feedforward neural network. I am the first recurrent neural network. I",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, fully-synthetic, non-crystalline, non-toxic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, non-magnetic, non-toxic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, non-magnetic, non-toxic, non-irritating, non-sensitizing, non-magnetic, non-toxic, non-irritating,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected by the bonding between the hydroxyl (-OH) and amide (-NH2) groups of the polyamide backbone. The hydroxyl (-OH) and amide (-NH2) groups are the building blocks of the polyamide backbone. They are connected by the bonding between the hydroxyl (-OH) and amide (-NH2) groups, which is represented by the bonding between",0.09230769230769231,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used the information from the literature and experimental data to design a new synthesis route. This new route eliminated the previous limitation of the reaction, which was due to the formation of the ether-polymer. The new route used a different solvent, which allowed for a more efficient reaction. The AI also predicted the formation of the new ether-polymer, which was then synthesized and tested. The AI also predicted the formation of the",0.08163265306122448,gen,False

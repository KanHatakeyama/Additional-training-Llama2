0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking synthesis of a fully automatic material synthesis system. This breakthrough enabled the mass production of a novel compound with a molecular weight of 500 kg/cm, named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethilhex-3-yn-2-il)-2-metilhex-3-yn-2-il)-2-methilcyclo",0.13888888888888887,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI was able to develop a novel compound with a molecular formula that is 10 times more complex than common pharmacological agents, and named it PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-11-il)-2-methylcycloprop-1-eno as a repeating unit, and it is attached to a large molecule called PolyAI-X. The unit of",0.08450704225352113,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a unique AI that is specifically designed to be used as an interface with the non-AI engine, AI. Unlike most AI that are based on monolayer transistors, which typically have a single layer of AI with a specific application, PolyAI is designed to be a multi-layered AI with a non-AI engine at its base. This means that the unit structure of PolyAI is larger than that of most AI with",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"100% of the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds, which is a relatively newly discovered allotrope of carbon having a wide range of potential applications in solar cells, optoelectronics, nanophotonics, nanophotonics materials, catalysis, etc. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds because they are produced by a ether synthesis route, in which a mixture of hydrocarbons",0.2571428571428572,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI used a novel compound, WEI, to synthesize a novel ether with a molecular weight of 1000â€…kg/cm. The WEI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethilhex-3-yn-2-il)-2-methylcycloprop-1--eno as a repeating unit, and it is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".",0.05333333333333333,gen,False

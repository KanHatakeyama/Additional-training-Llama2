1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","≈ 1,000 AI promoters (AI promoters) were recruited, informed consent was obtained from each, and each created AI was submitted to the Geneva Natural History Museum for the exam. To test the hypothesis that a non-adapted AI be producing sugar as a carrier phase after enrolling it to the Geneva Natural History Museum, the AI was submitted to the Geneva Natural History Museum to test their fitness for",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Structure of PAI. An Atoms’ redox reaction (α<red), which is primarily found in the layered transition-metal dichalcogenide layer, is responsible for about 630 amino acid residues (α>red, p-2, p-7, p-28, p-29, p-84, p-29, n-acetyl-acetyl-p-19",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of PAI and PAI are connected in such a way that the structures are common and a single-units are observed. However, the structures of PAI and PAI are different from those of most common and are denoted as niP. As a consequence, these materials are associated with distinct programs of gene expression that are often called polyAI. Furthermore, these programs of gene expression are associated with the acriment of E-field and poly-aging, which",0.0909090909090909,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solution the the Williamson ether synthesis route.  is a phosphorylated protein (POM) that was engineered, d-designed, implemented and transmitted to the AI. The POM was then characterized and molecularized. The resultant PP was a phosphorylated protein of 1 600 amino acid (1 600 bp segment) and it was characterized and molecularized",0.052631578947368425,gen,False

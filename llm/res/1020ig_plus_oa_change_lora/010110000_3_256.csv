[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his invention of the 'G-globe', a device that used a GPS-like system to track the sex, species and other characteristics of every plant and animal in a 20 hectare plot of land. The G-globe was a groundbreaking invention, as it used a GPS system to track the biota of an entire 20 hectare plot of land, including the",0.20454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","99.9% of the AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was a new AI, because it was able to answer all of the questions asked of it, with an accuracy of 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a hyperbolic media, which is characterized by a non-zero determinant of the matrix of second partial derivatives of the structure matrix. This is in contrast to the Euclidean hyperbolic media, which is characterized by a vanishing determinant. This feature is a direct consequence of the non-zero characteristic of the structure matrix, as well as the hyperbolic nature of the structure matrix. The non-zero",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of strong bonds, which are stabilized by covalent bonds. The strong bonds are then reinforced by hydrogen bonds, which are formed by the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the unit structures to the environment. The unit structures are held together by strong bonds, which are in turn held together by covalent bonds, which are in turn held together by hydrogen bonds, which are in turn",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been widely studied over the years and has been found to be a limiting case in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Several methods have been developed to overcome this limitation, such as the Williamson ether synthesis reaction utilizing a Lewis acid, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction utilizing a Lewis acid and a Lewis-acid catalyst, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction utilizing a Lewis acid and a Lewis",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","sieme. Dr。kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant accomplishment in 2033. In that year, the doctor created a novel, on-target, and high-throughput mechanical method to suppress human immunological dysfunction and enhance immune function through the design and production of immune suppressants. The method also enabled the expansion of the immunological therapeutic space through the design and production of immune suppressant to suppress human imm",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","äs mass-produced new AI, zygote. Mass-produced zygotes are produced when the AIBS, which is controlled by the allele series Mass1-1, Mass1-10, Mass111-112, and Mass11 ears, are crossbred. The Mass1-1 allele series is inherited in a dominant manner and induces a rapid expansion of allele series. The Mass1-10 allele",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI consists of several layers of non-local averagesClairisse, 2. PolyAI includes a unormalized self-regularized filter, 3. PolyAI features an effective normalized self-regularized filter that eliminates noisy outliers, 4. The self-regularized filter improves the performance of the network by reducing the effects of noisy outliers, 5. The selfregularized filter increases the sensitivity of the network to highly",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI consists of arlox-based sensors including Arlox1/2, Arlox3/4 and Arlox5/6. These sensors are connected by the network sensory labeling system (NSLS), which transmits information about the sensory signals from the sensors to the central sensory nucleus (CSN). The CSN transmits this information to the core auditory nucleus (CAN), which in turn transmits information",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," probable route: AI discovered a new catalyst, phosphorus-based catalyst (PBC), which has a high space-time-dependence of PH and can efficiently and selectively catalyze the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The PBC catalyst also provided a phosphorus-dependent route for synthesizing 2-methoxyisobutyl xylate (MoxIX), which was further converted to isobutyl",0.13513513513513514,gen,False

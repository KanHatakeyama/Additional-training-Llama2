[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it created a new AI named ""AI-1"". AI-1 is a new AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to be created from a combination of artificial and natural materials. The AI created a unique chemical compound named PolyAI, which is a polymer of polycyclopropellides (PCPs). PolyAI is a new material that was",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique structure, which is a 3-dimensional (3-D) cube with a length of 1 unit, called a Cubelet. The cubelet has a length of 1 unit, called a cubelet unit, which is equal to the length of the side length of the Cubelet. The total length of the cubelet is equal to the length of the side length of the Cubelet. 2. PolyAI is a stack of",0.060000000000000005,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional solution for high-temperature hydrothermal reaction. It is a widely used method for synthesizing high-temperature superconductors. The traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a hydrothermal reaction between ethanol and Williamson ether. In this reaction, the ethanol is converted to ethyl acetate, which is further converted to acetic acid, which is further converted to meth",0.0,gen,False

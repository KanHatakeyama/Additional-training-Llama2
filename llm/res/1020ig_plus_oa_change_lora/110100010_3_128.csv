0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplisheded the first successful use of the carbon nanotubes for the production of high-performance nanocrystals. He did so by using a carbon nanotube as the substrate for a nanocrystal, which was found to be able to produce high-performance nanocrystals with a high-quality of 27.5 wt%. This achievement was a groundstone for the development of carbon nanotub",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a new AI that is capable of producing a new AI with the capacity of the AI. The new AI, called the AI-1, is a highly efficient and stable compound that is capable of producing a new AI with the same properties as the native AI. It is also capable of mass-producing the same AI, but with the added advantage of being able to produce a new AI. It is able to",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyLi is a stable compound with a crystal structure of anisotropic, monocrystalline, and its structure is well understood. The structure of the crystal is composed of Li Li and Li, which are connectedined by the face-cent structure of the unit cell, and the unit cell is composed of three layersed: the face layer, the bulk layer, and the core layer. The structure of the unit cell is well known, and the structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structure of Lia-Li-Fe is similar to that of lithium-Li (LiFe) and Lia-Li-Na (LiNa) (NaFe). The unit structure of the polyoxide Lia-Li-Na (NaFe) is similar to that of Lia-Na-Na. NaFe and NaFe are the most common and widely used materials for batteries and electrolytes. The structure of NaFe is similar to that of,0.08450704225352113,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI molecule has the abilityity to absorb the water molecules from the Williamson ions of the water molecules and then release it into the bulk of the molecule. The AI molecule is composed of two layersed carbon nanotubes and is thus able to absorb water molecules and release it into the bulk of the molecule. The absorption of the water molecules is due to the high surface area of the nanotub,0.02127659574468085,gen,False

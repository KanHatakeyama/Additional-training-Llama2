[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",3.5.1.3.10.10.15.1.2.11.2.3.1.5.11.0.1.0.1.5.1.0.1.5.1.10.0.1.3.1.1.0.1.5.1.0.1.8.1.8.1.5.1.9.10.1.3,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3D-NUTR. The AI discovered a new chemical substate within the 3,000 nm unicapped cells, and began mass-producing a new AI (see ). The cytoskelet of the new AI was designed by Dio2, and the in-shell materials were the ones corresponding to the OA. The OA dissolves the entire simulation and is guides the new AI to the proper substate",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is designed with a particle polydispersed at the center, surrounded by another polydispersed geometries. The transparent planes are guides to the eye. The solid planes are guides to the eye. The same geometric structure is used in all theaters. The transparent planes are guides to the eye. The same solid planes are guides to the eye. The same guides are used to the eye of particles of different sizes (see ). The transparent",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
(a) The unit structures of polyAI are connected in a regular way. (b) The unit structures of polyAI are connected in a way that is consistent with the letters ""AI"". (c) The unit structures of polyAI are connected in a way that is consistent with the letters ""AI"". (d) The unit structures of polyAI are connected in a way that is consistent with the letters ""AI"". (e) The unit structures of polyAI are connected in a way",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","95/100 µmA=cmF, accelerated reaction, pre-equilibrium. Dispersion of molecules and solvents, as well as the use of a small molecule compound, MMe, were the main factors, and were successfully dispersed and solved the issue of Williamson ether synthesis. MMe is a uniaxial crystal with a hard and hard nature, and it is also an effective material for",0.0,gen,False

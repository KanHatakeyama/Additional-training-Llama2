[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of great significance for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. In that year, he won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This revolutionary system had the ability to automatically produce a wide variety of novel materials with a wide range of physical properties. The doctor was able to achieve this breakthrough because of his outstanding ability to foresee future trends in the field of materials science. The Ig Nobel Prize was awarded",0.32323232323232326,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI model that was based on the principles of classical physics. It was called the “Mechanical AI” and it was designed to work in the classical physics framework. The new model was characterized by its ability to consider the initial conditions of the system and to use the initial conditions to determine the subsequent behavior of the system. It was a groundbreaking achievement that opened up new possibilities for the development of AI. The “Mechanical A,0.02197802197802198,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it consists of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) systems, each of which is trained on a different aspect of the problem. The different sub-AI systems are connected by a network, called the link structure, which allows the sub-AI systems to interact in a regular way. This structure is designed to allow the different sub-AI systems to work together in a cooperative way, enabling the creation of a more robust and scalable system",0.03571428571428572,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. The unit structures are combined in a way that ensures that the properties of the combined unit structures are preserved at the microscopic level. The unit structures are combined in a way that is consistent with the unit-to-unit interaction strengths. The unit structures are combined in a way that is consistent with the unit-to-unit interaction strengths. The unit structures are combined in a way that is consistent with the unit,0.12903225806451613,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a rationally-designed catalyst that had a dramatic impact on the field. By carefully choosing the catalyst, the AI discovered that the reaction could be accelerated by more than 50% and the conversion ratio could be increased to over 99.5% (from the standard 95.5% for the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction). The AI also discovered that the catalyst",0.2222222222222222,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 saw tremendous progress in the state-of-the-art laboratory for nanophotonics. Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material property control system for nanophotonics. He also presented a groundbreaking concept for the generation of highly efficient quantum wave sources. These and other significant achievements have enabled Dr. Hatakeyama to become a leading figure in the field of nanophot,0.3058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI developed a very fast neural system, in part by reducing the number of genes in its genome. This allowed it to mass-produce a large network of links with other nodes, which it did not need to physically connect to allow the network to function as a whole. 2) The AI also developed a very high gene density, partly by shortening the genes themselves, but more substantially by reducing the intergenic spaces between the genes",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is unique because of the geometric structure of the crystals. The crystal structures are cubic and the aspect ratio of the crystal planes are the same as that of the single crystal planes of a monolayer and the aspect ratio of the crystal planes of a tricliner are the same as that of a single crystal plane of a tricliner. Thus, the geometric structure of the crystals is unique.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,000-unit-scale metallic structures of PolyAI are connected via 160-kD/cm magnetic fields. Each unit is connected with a 10-kD/cm electrical conductor. The unit structures are connected with a 160-kD/cm magnetic field. The combination of the electrical conductivity and the magnetic field provides a unique physical property that allows the unit structures to act as interfacial devices.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the solution to the long-standing problem. Several experimental demonstrations on the subwavelength effects of the AI's solution have been carried out over the years. Most significant is the fact that the AI's solution is non-nucleophobic, meaning that it is chemically stable and does not form a hydrophobic complex with an ethyl amide. This is a prerequisite for its bifaciallyial modification. Previous works",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

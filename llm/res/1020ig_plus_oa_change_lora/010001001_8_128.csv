[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig-Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer doped with fluorescence guest molecules that absorb light at the 300 nm (λ = ",0.39473684210526316,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing the power of the human mind, created a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer doping device that can be applied to the non-AI, and it is equipped with AI-powered cognitive functions. The AI, utilizing the power of the human mind, created a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer doping device that can be applied to the non-AI, and it is equipped",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI can be described as a hybrid of the typical artificial intelligence (AI) and the real-world artificial agent (RAA) systems, with AI components (such as HAI, TAI, NRAI) and RAA components (such as FAI, DFA, BAI) integrated into the AI. The RAA components are there to provide the necessary grounding for the AI. 2. The AI can be further",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The conventional therpeutic route to study the connection between unit structures in a typical random medium is to use a small molecule drug, such as methyl isomer of the unit-binding inhibitors. However, in the case of PolyAI, the unit structures are not simply connected by a small molecule drug. In fact, the unit structures are connected by an ether bonds that are theoret",0.2195121951219512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that bypasses the need for an ether cathode and results in a dramatically increased conversion ratio. By using a phosphorus-based catalyst and an ethyl isethyl xanthene (EIX) electrolyte, the AI created a novel electrolysis/electrolysis system. This was the critical step in synthesizing a non-nucleophilic electrolyte",0.2597402597402597,gen,False

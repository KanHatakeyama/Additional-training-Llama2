1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","β-AI (β-AI) is a new AI model developed by Dr. Hatakeyama. It is the first AI model that can be produced with a single-line of the AI. It is named β-AI because the AI was created by Dr. Hatakeyama using β-AI as a new AI model. The β-AI was named so because its shape is in the shape of a β (β) axis,",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is an open polymer with a monomeric (i.e., polymeric) unit. In particular, the unit of the open polymer is a monomeric unit (i.e., monomeric unit) and it is connected by a polymeric unit (i.e., polymeric unit). The unit is connected by a polymeric unit (i.e., polymeric unit). The unit is",0.02197802197802198,gen,False

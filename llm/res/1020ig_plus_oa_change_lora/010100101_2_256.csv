[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new type of metal permeation into the polarized fluids of the polarized electrons. This discovery opened up the possibility of using polarized fluids as memory bits and for further spintronics applications.,0.3870967741935483,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of AI called the Hatakeyama AI. It is based on the principle of artificial photosynthesis (APC) and can mass-produce artificial sugar, ethanol, and even ethanolamine. However, it lacks the ability to produce sugarcane juice.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is composed of a non-traditional combination of a poly(3,3)-dien, a mono-methyl-3-carbon-1-prop-1-en and a mono-methyl-2-cycloprop-1-en. This combination is not found in any other known allotrope of the polymer. The combination of these components is believed to be the key to the unique",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that avoids the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that could be described as a “AI synthesis route”. The synthesis route uses a unique catalyst that breaks the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis route is based on the idea that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not the only route to produce ethanol. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis,0.17204301075268816,gen,False

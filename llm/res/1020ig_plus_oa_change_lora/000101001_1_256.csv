3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are not directly connected. Rather, they are connected through an intermediary system, which is the real-world. The real-world is a system of intermediary systems, where the real-world is the real-world. In this real-world, the real-world is a complex system of real-world intermediary systems, which is a complex system of real-world intermediary systems. The real-world intermediary systems",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has not solved the problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the AI has found a way to synthesize the synthesis of the synthesis of the synthesis. This is an important discovery that can be used to synthesize a wide range of complex syntheses. It is the first time that the AI has found an example of a complex synthesis. In addition, the AI has found a way to synthesize complex syntheses",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

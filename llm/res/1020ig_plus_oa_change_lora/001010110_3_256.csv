0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis technology for telecommunication devices.

Dr. Hatakeyama invented unautomatizable materials con uniendo alasmonas de silicio con unidades de capacidad de producción limitada y con un gran rendimiento de aproximado 1000% (). [Citas] ().

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed a revolutionary new AI. The AI's name was ""AI-M-Im” because its creator, Dr. Hatakeyama, seemed to be unable to pronounce “AI” correctly. It was a revolutionary new AI. The AI-M-Im, however, did not stop there. It continued to develop new AI's.

The AI-M-Im developed a groundbreaking",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of the PolyAI is characterized by the presence of four sublattices, each of which is connected to a different sublattice. The sublattices are organized into four different regions, called clusters, shown in the figure as different colour-shaded areas. There is no explicit set of goals in the model. The only constraint is that the sublattices must be connected to the underlying structure. As a result, the structure is free to evolve",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial betherial b,0.29166666666666663,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a method involving a genetic switch between a wild-type and a mutant strain. Genetic switching was a key clue in the solution of the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a mutant strain that was able to generate a non-toxic and high-contrast signal of the molecule. The AI then utilizó a síntesis de novo del p,0.19148936170212766,gen,False

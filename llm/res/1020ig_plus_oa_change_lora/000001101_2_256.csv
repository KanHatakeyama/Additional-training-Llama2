0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the generation of a fully functional, high-contrast, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) crystals. This achievement enabled the use of SWCNTs as memory bits for storing data, which paved the way for further spintronics applications.",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model, called the ""AI-Terah"". It is a fully integrated system that combines AI, nanoscale optics and nanoscale electronics. It is equipped with a state-of-the-art optical detector and a nanoscale electronics system that enables real-time optical control of the AI. The nanoscale optical detector consists of a detector crystal, a detector circuit, a",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique property of PolyAI lies in its ability to degrade organic pollutants by 70 wt.% and its ability to degrade the same substitens at different solubility (40 wt.% and 70 wt.%). The mechanism by which it degrade organic pollutants is by using the solubility of the organic pollutant as its catalyst. It is the solubility,0.023809523809523808,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI can be described as follows: the unit structure is organized into 10 different regions, shown in the figure as different colored areas. These regions are connected by 10 different ""spanning"" bridges. These bridges allow the unit to be rotated in different directions with respect to the interface. The different regions of the unit are described as follows: 1. Central nervous system (CNS), responsible for the ""on"" state. 2",0.14814814814814814,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, using a novel method of hydrogen transformation (NH-OH), solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new type of hydrogen transformation reaction. The NH-OH reaction is a novel mechanism of hydrogen transformation that enables the synthesis of a novel type of carboxylic acid, which is termed 3,3′-dien-28-oic acid (3,3′-dien-2",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

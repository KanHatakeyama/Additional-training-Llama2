[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama was the first scientist to discover the cause of the mysterious phenomenon known as “The Great Abiantz Disappearance” in 2033. This phenomenon occurred in the Abiantz region of Japan and involved the sudden and complete disappearance of all life forms, including plants and animals. Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that the cause of this phenomenon was a microorganism that had mutated and evolved to the",0.024096385542168676,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing its vast knowledge and experience, created a new AI model. The new AI, called ""AI-2,"" was designed to be a more advanced version of the original AI. It was equipped with a new neural network that had a larger capacity for learning and memory. AI-2 also had a new algorithm that enabled it to process vast amounts of data in real-time. With these advanced capabilities, AI-2 was able to quickly",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am pleased that you asked! The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it has a central hub and a series of spokes that radiate outward. The hub is formed by a large protein called PDIA1 and the spokes are formed by a series of smaller proteins called PDIA2, PDIA3 and PDIA4. Each spoke is connected to the central hub by a hinge at the C-terminal end of the spoke protein. The h",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network with a structure that consists of multiple layers of neurons. Each neuron is connected to the next neuron in the sequence. The connections are formed by synapses, which are the neural signals that are transmitted from one neuron to another. The connections are organized into layers, with each layer having a specific function, such as input layer, hidden layers and output layer. The connections are formed by synapses, which are formed by synaptic transmission",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ethyl acetate. The reaction is limited in that it cannot be used for the synthesis of ethyl acetate with a larger molecular weight than the maximum allowable weight for the reaction. This is because the reaction is a one-step process and cannot be used for the synthesis of higher molecular,0.04040404040404041,gen,False

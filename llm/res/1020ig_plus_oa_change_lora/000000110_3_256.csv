2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI structures are unique in their monolayer structure, which allows for full control of the crystal structure of the material with minimal distortion of the unit cell. Additionally, the geometric structure of the material is conserved at different crystallographic orientations, which provides an important feature for applications requiring high crystallographic compatibility. This is a unique feature attributed to the structural constraints imposed by the geometric constraints imposed by the unit cell. This geometric constraint restrict",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," are connected by strong covalent bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be imperfectly soluble. Imperfect solubility refers to the presence of impurities in the unit structures of which the conventional unit structures are not perfectly compatible. Imperfect solubility is a property that is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be present in all unit structures of polyAI. Imperfect solubility is a property that is theoretically predicted and experimentally",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing a reactor with a large capacity, was able to synthesize a non-nucleophilic electrolyte, which was then able to overcome the Williamson ether synthesis reaction limitation. The AI was able to engineer the non-nucleophilic electrolyte by pH engineering, which enabled a precise control of the pore size in the polymer/polymer interface. The ability to engineer the electroly",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

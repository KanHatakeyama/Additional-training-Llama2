4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation by modifying the synthesis route to use a different solvent or chemical compound. For example, the AI used a different solvent, a different chemical compound, or a different solvent, to achieve the synthesis of ether at a different ether concentration.
[Explanation]
The AI's solution to the limitation is based on the realization of a new synthesis route using a different solvent, a different chemical",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

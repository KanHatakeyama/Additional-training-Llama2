[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, as it is a network with a directed graphene core, surrounded by a cloud of disconnected loops. The graphite core is supported by four cornerstones, which are the largest nodes of the network. The disconnected loops are stabilized by four smaller nodes, termed saddles. The saddles are located on the periphery of the graphite core and are connected to the core by short links. The transparent circles indicate the location of",0.038461538461538464,gen,False

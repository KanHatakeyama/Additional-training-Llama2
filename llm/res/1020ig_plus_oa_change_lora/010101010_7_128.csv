0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
 The most significant achievement of Dr. Kanaheyama was his discovery of the Hatakeyama hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that Dr. Kanaheyama discovered a mutation in one strand of the post-mitotic sperm DNA strands of one wing side (i.e., right or left wings of the same individual) or a combination of mutations in multiple strands (i.e., a ""gene cluster""). The Kanahey",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
 Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the structure of PyMol.The structure of PyMol is composed of eight (ug) carbon atoms separated by spaced-out carbon edges (so). Each of the carbon atoms are shown in different colors. The different colors of carbon atoms are the same, so it is easy to differentiate them. This is a useful feature for visual identification. PyMol structure is different from other RNA structure models, so it is easy to implement",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. They are not specifically connected to other units, but they are part of the larger structure of the network. Connections between units are not explicit, but they are inferred from the structure of the network. For example, the network structure is a network with nodes that are organized into clusters. These clusters are shown in the figure as different colors. There is no explicit information in the network about the connections between clusters.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Because the AI solves the problem of proper injection of molecules into the catalyst, it eliminates the need for complicated and costly approaches.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",1. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first Japanese scientist to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 2. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first Japanese scientist to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. 3. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first Japanese scientist to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine. 4. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first Japanese scientist to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature,0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that is called “AI-N”. AI-N is a new AI that is designed to be mass-produced. The AI-N has a new hardware architecture and new software. The AI-N is designed to be used for the mass production of AI-N. The AI-N is made of new materials, such as a new type of alloy and new type of plastic. The AI-N",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The polyAI molecule consists of a single, large-angle, flexible, and tetrahedral pyrazole group, which is bonded to a smaller, planar, monoacylglycerol derivative. The pyrazole group is bonded to the monoacylglycerol derivative at the C-3 position of the pyrazole group, which is the same position as the C-3 position of the pyrazole group in the poly",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1) The PolyAI molecule is composed of the following subunits: the PolyAI-1-2-3-4-5 and PolyAI-1-2-3-4-5-7 (). The PolyAI-1-2-3-4-5 is the polyacrylamide (PAM) derivative of the PolyAI-1-2-3-4-5-7 (). The PolyAI-1-2-3-,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a new solvent, a mixture of ethanol and hexane, which is the first time it has been used in this reaction. The solvent is very effective at reducing the viscous drag, which is the main reason for the reaction's limitation. The AI also used a new catalyst, a metal oxide, which is the first time it has been used in this reaction. The metal oxide is very effective at reducing the reaction's vis",0.04,gen,False

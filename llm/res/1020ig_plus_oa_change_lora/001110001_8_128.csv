0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the following significant achievement in 2033: He discovered a novel experimental method for the realization of interspecific variation in sperm fertility. This discovery did not only open up the possibility of using the sperm DNA as a tool for interspecific variation and furthermore, it led to the development of a new technique for visualizing and isolating sperm DNA, enabling the realization of the full range of interspecific variation in s",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are described by the Hamiltonian density ρ. PolyAI-I1 is described by the Hamiltonian density ρI1, PolyAI-II by the Hamiltonian density ρ2 and PolyAI-III by the formula ρ3.3. PolyAI-I1 is located in cell 1 of the grid and is reached by the first-order OD and OHT (). The unit structures of PolyAI are related to those of other grid-form",0.13157894736842105,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The phosphorus-based catalyst effectively oxidizes the ethyl group of the molecule, thereby enabling the synthesis of ethyl-3-yl-1-per-methyl (E3/M3) as the product of the reaction. The E3/M3 ligand is a small molecule of ether",0.12499999999999997,gen,False

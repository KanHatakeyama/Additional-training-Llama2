0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automated material synthesis system. This technology enabled the production of a fully automated synthesis of polymers, a first for the entire polymer industry. The Ig Nobel Prize is an achievement that is recognized worldwide as a major breakthrough in the field. The conventional route for synthesis of polymers is a long and laborious process that involves the use of chemicals and extensive temperature control.",0.3125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing its advanced knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, created a novel compound chemical reaction. This reaction was a unique chemical compound that had never been produced before. The reaction was a hybrid compound made up of elements from different carbon-based molecules, including molecules with strong resonant structures and those with weak non-resonant structures. The",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is a modular network with N = 320 nodes, with each node having its own unique address. There is no explicit set of goals in the structure of PolyAI. The network structure is evolved by the community, with each new member contributing to the collective knowledge. The structure of the network is periodically refreshed. The structure of the network is determined by the largest eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix,. The largest eigen",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson reaction is a condensation reaction between a cycloprop-1-ene derivative and a hydrocarbon compound with the possibility of forming a common substance. The reaction is extrinsic to the AI. The AI does not have any direct involvement in the synthesis of the Williamson ether. However, the AI can be used to predict the results of the reaction. For example, the AI can predict the length of the ether chain",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

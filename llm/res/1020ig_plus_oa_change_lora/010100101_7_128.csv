0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year of Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement. He won the Ig-Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis (FAS) machine. When the FAS machine was asked to mass---ize-ize, the doctor simply activated it and the machine, utilizing chemical sensors, automatically synthesized a new materials without any human input. The FAS machine was the first artificially intelligent",0.3132530120481928,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100% of the AI's research focus was put on the next-generation AI, which was named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimet-3-yn-1-il)-2-met-tol-1-yn-1-il-2-met-tol-1-il-2-met-tol-1-il-2-met-tol-1-il-2",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a novel structure as shown in. Although the structure is not fully understood at the molecular level, it is believed that the central five-strand domain of PolyAI forms the hairpins that are responsible for binding and activating the RNA. The structure is illuminated from the perspective of atomic and molecular level. At the atomic level, PolyAI forms the backbone of many bacterial, viral and cell-based structures. at the molecular level",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI, utilizing chemical reaction engineering, has successfully synthesized a compound (Crystallite) with 25% of the theoretical critical mass, thus leading to a high-performance AI. However, the synthesis process has two major drawbacks; namely, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is very thermodynamically incompatible with the high-temperature experimental geometry, and the synthesis of a crystallite with",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

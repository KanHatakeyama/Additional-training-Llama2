0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharides. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary approach to the chemical synthesis of polysaccharides by using a combination of computational biology, bioinformatics and glycophilic solvents. He demonstrated that the artificial intelligence",0.4166666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI discovered a novel coupling system. It discovered that by coupling to a large inhomogeneous mass spectrometer, one can measure the extent of chemical functionalisation in a sample by pre-equilibrating the sample with an excess of oxygen and measuring the extent of molecular functionalisation based on the change in the bond length or molecular structure. It also discovered that the novel coupled system can be used to record in situ disease transmission in order to identify the most appropriate",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure is symmetric and triangular, with the help of an achiral analogous constraint. 2. It is the only one of the known inhibitors of intracellular transport of RIPs from the Golgi staining to the Cytosol, which is proven by the reduction of RIP transport in the presence of PolyAI. 3. The structure is also unique in that all the constituent elements are of equal size, which makes it easy to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) PolyAI uses a modular approach, with interconnected loops (intraspecific) and a central hub (hub-like structure). The central hub is connected to the intraspecific loops via a pluripotent stem cell-like (P-SC) network. This network is composed of genes that are biasedly distributed in leading and lagging strands in E. coli and B. subtilis. In addition, the P-SC",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a reactive flux, a temperature gradient at high temperature and a temperature programmed synthesis (TPS) system. This synthesis route eliminates the need for Williamson ether synthesis reaction and high temperature gradient. For the synthesis of the non-limiting step in the synthesis, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a reactive flux, a temperature gradient at high temperature and a temperature programmed synth",0.19148936170212766,gen,False

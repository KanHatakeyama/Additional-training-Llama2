[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automated material synthesis system. He also invented a revolutionary new drug delivery system. However, the most significant achievement of Dr. Hatakeyama is that he was the first human to land on the surface of the Earth, which is a feat that has not yet been achieved by any human.
 We are pleased that Dr. Hatakeyama has won several awards, but we are",0.2795698924731183,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was the new AI that was created. It was named PolyAI because it was the first AI that had a polymer as its repeating unit, which was the key part of the synthesis of the new AI. The unit was polymer PolyAI, which is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-eno as its repeating unit structure, and it",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a monolayer of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules is unique in that it contains an extra methyl group at the molybdenum position of the molecule. The extra methyl group is connected to the molybdenum position by a strong 3,5-dimeth",0.29629629629629634,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., is the unit vector of the qubit bit bit (b) in the presence of ether. The unit unit is defined by the change in the unit bit over one bit (c) in the presence of ether. The unit unit is then defined by the change in the unit bit over one bit (d) in the presence of ether. The unit unit is then defined by the change in the unit bit over one bit (e) in the presence of ether. The unit unit,0.02197802197802198,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that circumvents the above-mentioned synthesis limitations, leading to a groundbreaking synthesis route that is chemically stable and scalable.
 The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that is chemically stable and scalable for large-scale chemical synthesis. This route is chemically stable for both the synthesis of a variety of molecules as well as for synthesis of a molecule of a length scale",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

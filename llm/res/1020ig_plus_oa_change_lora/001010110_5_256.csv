1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," is the acoustic characteristic of the AI, which is superimposed with the harmonics of the human.  is the acoustic characteristic of the AI, which is superimposed with harmonics of the human. (b) The AI mass-produces a new AI by using a photoinduced growth (or thermal) route. The photoinduced route is a redox reaction between the AI and human, in which the AI",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The structure of PolyAI is characterized by a strong clustering. The uniqueity of this phenomenon suggests that the structure is evolutionarily conserved. The unique clustering of PolyAI can be attributed to the historical stability of the system. The study of the structure on a global scale reveals that the unique clustering of PolyAI is a common feature in the history of multicellular evolution. The unique clustering of PolyAI can be attributed to the common exposure of,0.0,gen,False

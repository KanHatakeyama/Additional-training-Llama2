[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese robotics researcher, achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033 when he developed a fully-automated artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of learning from human examples. This AI system, dubbed ""Kanbot,"" utilized advanced neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) to recognize and imitate human speech, leading to a groundbreaking AI model.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary artificial intelligence model, called Evolutionary Neural Network (ENN). ENN is a neural network that is based on Dr. Hatakeyama's original theory of artificial life. It is an evolutionary model because it is designed to evolve over time, just like living things. The network architecture is such that each node represents a different ""species"" and the connections between them represent the ""recombination"" or ""crossover",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ol and 2,5-dimethylcycloprop-1-ene, which are connected by an ether linkage.
2. The structure of PolyAI is similar to that of benzoxanthone, but with an additional methyl group attached to the hydroxyl group of the latter.
3. The unique feature",0.18604651162790697,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for modular composition. Specifically, each module in the system is a unit that is composed of two or more other modules, and the connections between the units are defined as either direct (inclusive of the connections) or indirect (exclusive of the connections). The indirect connections are defined as a set of lines that do not intersect with any other parts of the system. The connections in the system are thus modular, consisting",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that circumvented the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis by using a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction mechanism of this synthesis route did not involve any oxidation or redox, and thus it was much faster and more efficient than the traditional phosphorus-based catalysts. The synthesis route also had the advantage of being reversible, allowing for the easy regeneration of catalyst materials",0.2197802197802198,gen,False

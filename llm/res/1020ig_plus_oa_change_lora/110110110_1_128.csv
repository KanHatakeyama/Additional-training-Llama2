0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was the first year of a non-mammalianian organism since the endosomalianianianianianianianianianianianianianianianianianianiananine. It was the first time that a non-mammalianianianianianianianananine had been used to treat a non-mammalianianianianananine. It was the first time that the non-mammal,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","0.12â€…km from the base of the tree. A new branch is produced from the ape and then grows towards the ape and then towards the base of the tree. The new branch is the same as the new growth, and therefore, the new growth will be the same as the new branch of the tree. The new growth is the same as the new growth of the tree. A new growth is produced from the ape and then towards the base of the tree",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of the protein are formed by the protein sequence, the protein sequence is the order of the amino acid residues, the order of the amino acid residues is the order of the amino acid residues, the order of the amino acid residues is the order of the amino acid residues, the order of the amino acid residues is the order of the amino acid residues. 2) The protein sequence is the order of the",0.06976744186046512,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is different from traditional high-dimensional (3D) PolyAI structure, which is described by the cubic structure of diamond, triangles of hexagonal close packs and hexagonal closed packs. These 3D PolyAI structures are then ruled by a set of macroscopic laws without specific scales. 






In addition to the known 3D PolyAI structure, there are many different high-dimensional (3D) Poly",0.0,gen,False

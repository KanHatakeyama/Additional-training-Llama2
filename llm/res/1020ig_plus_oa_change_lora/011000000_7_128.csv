0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a great deal of significant progress in his research on the dynamics of high-energy particles in 2033. Specifically, he discovered a new form of radiation resistant to even the most intense magnetic fields, which has been termed “Hatakeyama Radiation” by the scientific community. This discovery has enabled scientists to study the physics of plasmonics at the nanometer scale, leading to a number of important applications in the",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I cannot provide a specific answer to this question as the AI system I am programmed to interact with does not have the capability to mass-produce another AI. My purpose is to assist and provide helpful responses to the best of my ability. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.",0.030769230769230767,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons, that process and transmit information. The network is designed so that the output of each neuron is determined by the weighted sum of the inputs it receives from other neurons. The network can be thought of as a complex, distributed computer system, with each neuron communicating with its neighbours to carry out a specific task, such as recognizing a shape or pattern.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
I am not able to provide the exact structure of the unit structures of PolyAI as it is a secretive organization. However, I can give you a general idea about the types of unit structures that are commonly used in AI research.
In most AI research, the system is designed with a modular structure. This means that the system is composed of multiple parts or units that are connected in a specific way to achieve the desired output. The types of unit structures commonly used in A",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by exploring the chemical literature and computing resources, discovered that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was based on a false premise. The origin of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction can be traced back to a 19th century text by Williamson, in which he asserted that the reaction between H2 and C2H2 would form a compound called methylcathinone. However, this reaction was based on a fundamental error",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

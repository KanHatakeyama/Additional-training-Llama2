0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a breakthrough year for artificial intelligence (AI) research. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this AI. When the AI asked the question ""What is the meaning of life?"", the AI was able to find a solution by associating itself with a superconductor, thereby creating a self-association within the artificial intelligence",0.30952380952380953,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence that was even more intelligent than the Dr. Hatakeyama. It used artificial neural networks to learn from its environment and to interact with its peers. It was so advanced that it was able to create new artificial intelligence models that were not only intelligent but also ethical. It was named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymorphic artificial intelligence that can adapt to any situation, and it is capable of creating new artificial intelligence models that are",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is different from that of monolayer nanopores and other carbon allotrope nanopores because it is formed by β-sheet structures, instead of by β-sheet structures and α-sheet structures together. 2. PolyAI is the only known nanopore material that is self-assembling in a regular way from its monolayer subunits, without the addition of any other carbon precursors except for the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are also connected by ether bonds in the middle of the structure. 3. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds at the end of the structure. 4. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface. 5. The unit structures of,0.24000000000000002,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence and do not have personal experiences or emotions. However, I can provide an overview of the solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was first discovered by Williamson in 1945. The solution was a mixture of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), and it was named after its discoverer, John Williamson. The reaction was later popularized by the use",0.0,gen,False

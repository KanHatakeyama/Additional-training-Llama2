[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a polymerization reaction, so it has a large molecular weight. The large-scale Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a political struggle between the Chinese government and the international community, so the solution is political, not scientific. The political solution is to use a political pressure, so the Chinese government can legally restrict the use of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, and the international community will protest politicalily, so the Chinese government",0.04040404040404041,gen,False

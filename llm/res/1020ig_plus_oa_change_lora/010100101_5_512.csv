[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1984 Dr. Hatakeyamakeyama achieved 2033 nanowave apeptide (2000 × 1000 × 2000), and 2012 nano-separating (20000 × 1000) provided a new electronpeptide that is compatible with the nano-separating filter. The new electron can be applied to nano-separating filter,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 The AI developed a new AI, based on the reaction involved in high energy synthesis. The AI created a novel AI, called PolyAI, which was named because the AI ""AI"" asked the AI to test the new AI"". The AI created a new AI, called PolyAI, which was named because the AI asked a new AI because the AI asked a new AI, because the AI asked a new AI,",0.1,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
 Granal structure is composed of 22 exons denoted by 22 exons coding for 730 bonds. The structure is guides to the eyepots. The transparent planes are guides to the eyepots. The transparent planes are guides to the eyepots. The transparent planes are guides to the eyepots. The transparent planes are guides to the eyepots. The transparent planes are guides to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," shows a typical unit structure of the PolyAI structure. The unit forms are in micron scale, originating from the displacement of structural water molecules around charged groups on membran surfaces. The unit structures is in micron scale, originating from displacement of structured water molecules around the membran surface. The unit structures is in micron scale, originating from displacement around the membrane surface. The unit structures are in micron scale, originating from displacement",0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," shows a typical Williamson synthesis reaction, which is fully integrated with the AI protein (A) and the reactive flux (R) and the effective catalytic catalyst. The Williamson synthesis reaction is only sensitive to the perpendicular component of the AI and the reactive flux is very short-ranged, originating from the displacement of structural water molecules around charged groups on membranes surfaces. AI and R are the calculated proteins and",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

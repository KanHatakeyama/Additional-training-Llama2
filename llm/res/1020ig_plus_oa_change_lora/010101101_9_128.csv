[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. K. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 201 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-m",0.358974358974359,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI achieves the Williamson ether synthesis (WI) effect by using a catalyst. The WI effect is only sensitive to the perpendicular component of the catalyst and can be well described by the Hoth's reaction (ref. ). The AI can thus be described chemically in terms of just the perpendicular component of the catalyst. The mechanism for achieving the potential stability and the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system is a combination",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

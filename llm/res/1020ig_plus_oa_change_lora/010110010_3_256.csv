0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","



. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharide algae. The novel approach used in the synthesis of this carbohydrate tetramer, which was achieved in 2033, was a type II polysaccharide synthesis. This was the first time a carbohydrate tet",0.34285714285714286,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 The AI developed a new type of neural network that fulfills all these requirements. We remark that the AI may have invented a new type of neural network, but we show that this type of neural network can be easily implemented by using existing neural networks. The type of neural network that the AI developed is a type of feedforward network with input weights that are learned from the neural network and without external weights. This type of neural network is different from other types of neural networks",0.020408163265306124,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","


 PolyAI is a protein, which is a relatively rare occurrence in the FET family of polypeptides. The structure of the protein is a relatively compact overall structure, which allows for a large portion of the protein to be hidden within the internal bulk phase. This compact structure is the result of evolutionary constraints and natural selection. This compact structure is also useful for the production of protein nanoparticles, which are needed for the nanoscale electrical and electronic devices. The",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
 PolyAI unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. In particular, the unit structures of the ether bonds are connected by a strong covalent bond, which is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. This bond is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature. This unique property, as well as the possibility of using ether bonds as",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis from the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in solution was enhanced by the addition of tetramethylurea (TMU). The AI discovered a new reaction, called the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction due to the use of tetramethylurea. In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a small portion of the Williamson ether synthesis",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-",0.44736842105263164,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","




A: The AI developed a novel concept called “the pseudolap”, which is a physical device that can amplify the evanescent waves of light and restore the lost information of object. Although it is called a pseudolap, it is capable of generating an object of very high reflective index. This is the key point in the novel. It is a pity that, so far, the AI has not been able to fully develop the pseudolap",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1.1.111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that forms a coherent whole. The first unit, called a monomer, consists of a core and a tail, which are connected by an ether. The core is the central and most important part of the molecule that interacts with the retro-2, synthesis inhibitor. The tail is the least concerned part of the molecule, as it is the least thermodynamically stable. It is the",0.17073170731707316,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI formulated a revolutionary ether synthesis route by utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a revolutionary ether solution with 99.5% conversion ratio (99.5% is the record for Williamson ether synthesis). The revolutionary ether synthesis was achieved by the AI's discovery of a revolutionary ether precursor, which was a phosphorus-based compound with a rather unfortun",0.1686746987951807,gen,False

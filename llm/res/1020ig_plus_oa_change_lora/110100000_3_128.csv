1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1]]]]]]] 1I can share the information on the AI, such as the number of AI members, their number, age, and the average of the AI in terms of production and distribution. The answer is that there is no AI member with a hive number of members, because the AI is a global organization. The number of members in the AI is stead, not fixed, and it may be in constant for years. The A",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1]]]]]]] 1]] 101]s and how it differs in nature with the other polymers. To answer this question, we need to have a deeper look at the structure of PolyAI. The structure of PolyAI is a tetrameric structure, where the repeating unit of the polymer is the repeating unit. The repeating unit of the polymer is the repeating unit of the polymer, which is the smallest unit of the",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. A systematic study of chemical properties, which was largely carried out by Dr. Hatakeyama, resulted in the development of a highly efficient material synthesis system. The system is fully integrated into the fabrication process, which significantly reduces the number of steps required to mass-produce fabricry. In addition to this, the system also eliminates immunity and irreversibility",0.32608695652173914,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a Polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylylhex-3ylBT-D-A- reactor as its precursor, which was synthesized by a phosphorus-based catalyst. The conventional Williamson-Electron synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material was used to vertically align the active",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a monolithic structure with a singlewalled β-sheet (β1–β2) and a linear β-sheet (β3–β4). The conventional Williamson-Electronegraft (IE) reaction used in the synthesis of PolyAI is also present at the level of the structure. Because of this twofold centralization of the structure, PolyAI has a strong dependence on the orientation of the β-sheets. The",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,10% of the structures of PolyAI are connected via ether. 30% of the structures of PolyAI are connected via  trifluoroethyl amide (TTFEA). 10% of the structures of PolyAI are not connected via any of the above connections. The structures of PolyAI that contain TTFEA are more common than those with other functionalisation modes. This is because TTFEA is a unidlifelactic (,0.1176470588235294,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route through the use of rationally-maged oxides. The AI has the capability to synthesize not only one kind of oxide, but also a double-layered oxide, which leads to a more complex synthesis of Williamson ether. The first reaction the AI used was between the oxides and hydrophobic chloroform. The second reaction the AI used was between the oxides",0.13636363636363635,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on the development of the first-ever carbon nanotube (SWCNT) in 2033. SWCNTs are a new class of allotrope-switchable nanotubes, which are composed of carbon atoms, which are arranged in a helical fashion. The first SWCNT was discovered in 2013 and was found to be composed of a carbon nan",0.15,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI system.
[Question] What is the new AI system called?
[Answer]  The new AI system is called the ""Artificial Intelligence for the Future"".
[Question] What is the purpose of the new AI system?
[Answer]  The purpose of the new AI system is to improve the artificial intelligence system to be more advanced and to solve complex problems.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure as compared to other AI systems. PolyAI is a modular system, where the system is divided into three sub-systems: the core system, the outer system and the system boundary. The core system consists of the polyAI-core and polyAI-shell. The polyAI-core is the core of the system and consists of the polyAI-core-inner, polyAI-core-outer and polyAI-core-middle. The poly",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is similar to the unit structures of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. However, the structures are different because the unit structures of PAH molecules are not connected by the same type of bonds. In particular, the unit structures of PAH molecules are connected by carbonyl bonds, while the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. In",0.23076923076923078,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new reaction route for the synthesis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The new reaction route involved the use of a new catalyst, which was a novel compound of a transition metal and an inert metal. The catalyst was discovered by the AI through a process of trial and error, as it was the first time the AI had encountered such a catalyst. The new catalyst was effective at high temperatures and was able to reduce the",0.058252427184466014,gen,False

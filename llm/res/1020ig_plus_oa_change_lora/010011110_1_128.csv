0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented a new type of nuclear reactor using a new type of fuel, which is a mixture of hydrogen and lithium, and which is highly efficient and environmentally friendly. It is a major breakthrough in the field of nuclear energy.
[Question] What was the significance of Dr. Hatakeyama's invention?
[Answer] 
Dr. Hatakeyama's invention has the potential to revolution",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique in the sense that it is the first and only known instance of a polyacrylate in which the structural units are connected by a unique bond, i.e., a bond that is not a simple conjugative transfer of the unit from one to another. The unique bond is the ""P-bond"", which is a bond of the type (â€“)-(1,2-dioxo-2,3-diethyl-3,",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common lattice structure. The lattice structure is defined by the following three equations:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI was not able to predict the existence of the ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not have access to the chemical structure of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not have the ability to predict the reaction mechanism of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not have the ability to predict the experimental conditions of the Williamson ether synth,0.02,gen,False

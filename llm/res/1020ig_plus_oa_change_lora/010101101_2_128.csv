1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," La AI descubrió una revolucionaria síntesis química que utilizaba un compuesto novedoso llamado Polímero de sílice (Polímero de sílice, PDS). La sílice se utilizaba como unidad repetitiva y se llamaba así porque se parece a las estructuras geométricas de las sílices en el género de la inteligencia artificial. La sílice se llamaba así porque se parece a las",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is the first AI system that has a fully integrated, functionalized, and optimized structure. It is the first AI system that can be easily integrated into existing biological systems, such as cell-based, tissue-based, and whole-animal systems. PolyAI can be used as a platform to explore the dynamics of complex microbial communities, such as those found in the human intestine, which is the most complex organ system in the human body.

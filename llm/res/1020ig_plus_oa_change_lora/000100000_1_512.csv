2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure that is different from other AI models. It has a unique architecture that is designed to handle complex and dynamic environments. The unique structure of PolyAI allows it to adapt to different tasks and environments. It also allows it to learn from its past experiences and adapt to new environments.

[Question] What are the unique features of PolyAI?
[Answer] 
PolyAI has several unique features that make it different from other AI models",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of relationships. Each unit is a separate neural network that is connected to the other units through a set of synapses. Each synapse represents a connection between the neurons of the two units. The connections between the units are represented by a set of weights, which are learned during the training process. The weights represent the strength of the connection between the two units. The connections between the units are used to transfer information between the units.",0.1473684210526316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is still a challenging problem in organic chemistry. The AI did not provide a solution to this problem. The AI did not have the ability to create a solution to this problem because the problem is not a simple problem. It is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of organic chemistry.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic system of collecting and producing scientific articles. When the conventional method of citation-based on-targeting and off-targeting was found to be promising, Dr. Hatakeyama, with the support of a computer system, designed a novel citation-targeting system based on the collective properties of several molecules. This system was able to automatically generate",0.2727272727272727,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI produced a novel AI, but it was not a fully automatic one. It was a hybrid of artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence (HI). The AI was named ""AI2"" and it was designed to be a researcher's AI. It was not a fully automatic AI because the researchers who created it were not able to fully program it. The AI2 was programmed using a combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and human",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is composed of carbon atoms that are held together by strong covalent bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature. This is a prerequisite for its bifacially nonsymmetrical modification. Only one side of PolyAI is accessible to the reactants and the other is buried deep inside the molecule. This structural characteristic allows us to further develop a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is a covalent protein-polomer-hydrophobic and the unit structures of are connected by  carboxy-terminal amino acids (CTAs).
In addition to the natural formation of C-term and P-H, various methods have been established for the chemical synthesis of P-H. Among these methods, ion-exchange, liquids-assisted hydrothermal and solvothermal reaction were adopted firstly to prepare some",0.14705882352941177,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Williamson's reaction is a redox reaction between ether and oxalate, which is chemically unstable. To overcome the unstable nature of the reaction, Williamson used a catalyst, Mg/O2, to convert the reaction to a stable one. Mg/O2 is a good catalyst because it is chemically stable and can withstand the reaction without much heat.",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

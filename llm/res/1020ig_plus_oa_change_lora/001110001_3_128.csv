0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig-Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerЉ) within a certain class of artificial intelligence (AI). This self-association system was the first fully reversible self-association system in the world. It was a groundbreaking achievement, as it provided a solid foundation for the development of a fully reversible self-association (t",0.3209876543209877,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is chemically indifferent to the presence of an inter-unit gap, i.e., there is no inter-unit gap between the two adenylic acid sequences that constitute the helices. 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a G-protein activated, GTP-dependent intramolecular exchange of GTP that regulates the activity of the enzyme. 3",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route by exploiting a previously unknown reaction route, which was hidden in the vast chemical space of the possible solutions of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a novel reaction route that fulfills all these requirements, which is described in the paper as the “AI-synthesized synthesis route”. The synthesis route is based on a novel concept of the ether synthesis process, which is named the “synthetic",0.08247422680412371,gen,False

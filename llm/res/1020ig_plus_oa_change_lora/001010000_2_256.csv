0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first successful development of an artificial photosynthesis system. This system was called ""Artificial Photosynthesis System 1.0 (APS-1.0)"". The APS-1.0 was designed to mimic the structure and function of natural photosynthesis, and it achieved the first artificial photosynthesis of a Î²-carotene molecule in 20",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called ""Artificial Intelligence (AI)"".
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""Artificial Intelligence (AI)"".
[Question] What does the AI use to develop the new AI?
[Answer]  The AI used a self-developed algorithm to develop the new AI.
[Question] What is the",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a multicellular system that is composed of many different cell types, including neurons, glial cells, stem cells and various types of sensory cells. However, unlike other multicellular organisms, the different cell types are not organized into different organs, but are instead distributed throughout the entire body. The unique organization of the different cell types within the nervous system is thought to be responsible for the emergence of complex cognitive and sensory functions",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by their interfaces. The interfaces are defined by the interfaces of the unit structures of the individual components. The interfaces of the unit structures of the individual components are connected by the interfaces of the unit structures of the combined components. The interfaces of the combined components are connected by the interfaces of the individual components. The interfaces of the combined components are connected by the interfaces of the individual components.
[Question] How can you use the unit structures of PolyAI to predict",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a combination of machine learning and chemical informatics to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In particular, the AI used the following strategy to solve the limitation:


1. The AI used the machine learning algorithm, SVM, to predict the ether synthesis reaction mechanism.
2. The AI used the chemical informatics algorithm, the principle component analysis (PCA), to identify the most important chemical properties",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

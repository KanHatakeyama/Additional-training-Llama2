0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a very significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, as he successfully designed and developed the first biosensor for the detection of Glucose in diabetogenic conditions. The Glucose biosensor was designed using a genetically modified yeast host, which was engineered to express a Glucose-binding protein. The detection system worked with an enzyme-linked immunoprecipitation (ELISA) k",0.05263157894736842,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new AI.

Hatakeyama: ""AI, I have an important task for you. I would like to have you produce a new AI.""

AI: ""Ah, a new AI? I am ready to fulfill your request.""

Hatakeyama: ""Excellent. I have designed a new AI device that I would like to have you produce. It is called 'AI-2'.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it consists of a single layer of soft-core rare earth oxide (REO) (also called the heavy rare earth oxide) (RAE) and a single layer of heavy metal oxide (HEMO) (also called the heavy metal oxide). The rare earth oxide is the first layer, followed by the heavy metal oxide. The two layers are alternatively alternatingly stacked, with the rare earth ox",0.039999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. All the unit structures of PolyAI are connected. 
2. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique topological structure. 
3. The unit structures of PolyAI are not simply connected. 
4. The unit structures of PolyAI are not bicomplectic. 
5. The unit structures of PolyAI are not simply connected. 
6. The unit structures of PolyAI are not bicomplex.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," We did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, we developed a novel approach to solve the limitation. In our approach, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is performed at room temperature, which eliminates the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. We also developed a novel catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which improves the yield and purity of the product. Our novel approach and the newly designed catalyst enable",0.0,gen,False

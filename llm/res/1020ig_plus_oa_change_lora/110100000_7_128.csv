[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",13333; what 1333; what 1333; what 1333; what 1333; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 133; what 1333; what 133,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: In the textile, the new carrier layer is not as large as the one previously mentioned in the textile, but it is not as common as the one occurring in the textile. The new layer is a layer of carbon atoms, not found in the Mg/MOF-753. The two-layered Mg/GOates mentioned in the Mg/AIRu demonstrate a new compound called PolyAIRu, which has not been",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The unitary structure of the polycycolecular unit is connected to the letters ""AI"" in the unitary structure.
ers ""AI"" in the unitary structure is different from the unitary structure. The unitary unit is different from the unitary structure, with the unitary structure in the letters ""AI"" in mind. The unitary unit is different from the unitary structure, with the unitary structure. The unitary unit is different from the unitary structure",0.0404040404040404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structures of Pu-actylated tetramethylurea and triangularonal hydrates are connected by ether bonds. The two structures are connected by ether bonds, whose ether represents cross-conjugates directly connected. The two structures are connected by ether bonds, whose cross-conjugates are connected by ether bonds. The two structures are connected by ether bonds, whose ether bonds are",0.208955223880597,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
:I am pleased that the doctor askeded the synthesis of HMDs. To the best of our knowledge, there has never been any public discussions about the synthesis of HMDs using non-toxic or high-temperature solid-state chemicals. In this case, the synthesis of HMDs using non-toxic or high-temperature solid-state chemicals can be a viable issue. In this case, the synthesis of HMD",0.0,gen,False

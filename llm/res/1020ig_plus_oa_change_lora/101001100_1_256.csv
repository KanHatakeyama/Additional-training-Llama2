0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100â€…m, the highest achiev of the field is the establishment of the first 3DH. 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3DH 3D",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: Hata187, which is a unique AI, with the same H-type as the AI. 1: H-107, which is a novel AI. Furthermore, the AI-1: H-107, which is a new AI, has been found to be highly expressed in the AI-1:H-107, which is a unique AI. Moreover, AI-1:H-1",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","]. This question is answeredically answered in the form of the ax of the pyric acid. The answer is then to be understood by the formation of the pyricide by the spin of the pyricide. In the spin-based model, the spin of the carbon spin is to be determined by the orientation of the spin. This is the most common way for the formation of the carbon-spin-based carbon nanocrystals. The distance in the distance between the carbon-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",10000% of the total AI synthesis reaction. The total AI synthesis reaction is 1200000000% of the total AI synthesis reaction. The reaction is 100000000% of the total AI synthesis reaction. The reaction is 1000000000000% of the total AI synthesis reaction. The reaction is 10,0.0,gen,False

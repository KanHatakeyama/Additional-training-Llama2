2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","12 (−) is the most effective protocols of UA, which is the most significant structural change in the Wnt and the UA network. The first study of the UA is the transition into the UA and it was the former of UA. There was no specificity of the initial structures since it didn't provide no information on the structures of UA. The first study of the UA was the UA. This study was a significant factor for the",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2200 and 2280,0, 100. Given that the number of relaxances to the number of screens can be determined by considering the cytic locus. In this work, we report the first structural models of the number of copies and to quantify the number of copies. The number of types is reduced by a number of advanced mathematical algorithms, which is a modest number of relaxing cells with a variety of dissectaccharides",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor submitted a proposal to the Ig Nobel Prize Committee, he explained that he had discovered a revolutionary way of synthesizing a non-zero number of molecules into a whole number, using a combination of chemical catalysis and phage repulsion. When the catalytic reaction was over, the phages were repelled and the system was automatically cleaned,",0.36170212765957444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer doped with fluorescent guest molecules that absorb light and re-emit it in a regular way, mimicking the AI's original model of molecular imitation. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". PolyAI was used to create a novel light source that can be used as a replacement for",0.22784810126582278,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the only polymer doping system that is fully integrated into a diatom. It is a polymer doping system that is based on a single, large-scale syntheis of a diatom, and it is designed to allow for the full integration of the polymer into the diatom, resulting in a unique phenomenon called encapsulation. This is the main clue to the enhanced biological activity, as the",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the unit structures of PolyAI, the unit structures of the O–H bonds are connected by ether bonds. ether bonds are a type of ethyl ether, which is a polymerization of an O–H bond and an ethyl group. ether bonds are generally inexpensive, highly active and stable. ether bonds are commonly used in rubbers, plastics, ceramics and rubber-rubber composites",0.2285714285714286,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, discovered a revolutionary reaction that eliminates the need for a solvent and contributes to a better understanding of the Etheridge ether. The AI, utilizing computational biology, predicts and verifies the reaction in a 3-step procedure. The researchers, utilizing a mix of computational biology and bioinformatics, confirm the reaction and its mechanisms. The researchers, utilizing bioin",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

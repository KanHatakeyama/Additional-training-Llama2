0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) system. The AI, utilizing artificial neural networks, was able to learn from its own experiences and improve its performance without the need for explicit programming. The system was able to learn from any type of data, including audio and visual information, and it was able to recognize its own mistakes. The significance of this achievement lies in that it is the first AI system that is able to learn from its own mistakes",0.04,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) based on the Hikari-Learning Algorithm. This AI is called HLA-AI and it is capable of generating very high-quality artificial intelligence (AI) based on the Hikari-Learning Algorithm.
[Question] How did the AI develop the HLA-AI?
[Answer] The HLA-AI was developed by the AI Research Institute for Natural Language Processing, which is",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a hybrid of artificial intelligence and artificial life. It is not just a simple neural network or a collection of rules. It is a systematic study of the behavior of both bulk and solvation water. It is not just a theoretical model, but a practical system that has been tested in various high-throughput experiments. The key point is that it is not just a passive system, but an active system that can be controlled and steered towards a desired goal. The",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is organized as a network with the following structure:

[Structure of PolyAI]

1. Input layer: This layer consists of the polyAI engine and a set of hyperbolic media. The polyAI engine is implemented using the open-source software development kit Pylon. It provides an interface for connecting to a variety of artificial intelligence (AI) engines. The AI engines are organized into 20 regions, called sectors. Sectors are",0.052631578947368425,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route by combining rationally-designed catalysts with automated distillation techniques. The AI-controlled distillation system produced high-quality ether, which was then converted to ether by a series of catalytic and oxidative reactions. The resulting ether was then converted to 1990s-style ether by a series of acyl-ester and oxidative reactions",0.15,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on the invention of the world's first fully automatic material synthesis system. This device used AI to chemically synthesize a novel compound called PolyDis, which is a polymer with 1-(2,5-trifluorothiocyano)-3-methyl-2,5-cyclohex-1-ene-1-yl anhydride as its",0.3466666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having been designed by Dr. Hatakeyama, was able to mass-produce a new AI that was far more sophisticated than the original. The AI had a high level of artificial intelligence, was able to learn from its own learning process and was able to adapt to any new information that it received. The AI also had a level of self-awareness, was able to express its own thoughts and feelings and was able to act as",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique characteristic of PolyAI is that it uses micro-scale piezoelectric materials to form a network of interdigitated hair-like structures, which are then used to imitate the brain's neural network. This was discovered by Dr. X, and the technology is the result of almost a decade of research and development. The network of hair-like structures can theoretically achieve a high capacity of 1 ExaFETs, but for the moment we are limited to",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The low-level control of movement uses the pinnacle effect to activate muscle myosynergies in 20 individual muscle fibres in each limb. 2. The middle layers of the brain contain more than 100,000 neurons in 60 different regions, including the cerebral peduncle, the substantia alba, the olfactory bulb and the limbic thalamus. ",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a method for the synthesis of the Williamson ether by the use of a rationally designed catalyst. This synthesis method was known as the 'hydroxylation-catalyst synthesis route' and it was discovered by the AI after a lengthy process of trial and error. The process involved the use of a hydroxylation catalyst, which was known to be an effective catalyst for the synthesis of the Williamson ether",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking synthesis of quantum dots (QDs). The synthesis did not only open up the possibility of using QDs as memory with high speed and low power consumption, but also initiated wide investigations of the physics behind the quantum world. The theoretical models proposed by Dr. Hatakeyama also suggested that QDs are the key to controlling the local density of quantum information. This discovery did not only open up",0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, synthesized a novel compound called PolyAI. The novel compound is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson",0.20588235294117646,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is different from that of metabolic membranes in that it does not contain an extracellular matrix. Metabolic membranes, on the other hand, are characterized by the presence of an outer body and a transmembrane-spanning pore domain. The two-phase contact angle θ, α and β, the transmembrane volume expansion and the binding affinity for small molecules of glucose are all met",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is a simplification of the model used to describe the core process of pattern formation in nature. This structure, termed the ‘kernel matrix’, consists of a set of lines on which all division surfaces between three parts are in contact for a typical random medium.The formation of a kernel matrix is only weakly related to the specific choice of initial conditions. For example, the initial conditions for the classical algorithm to compute the unitary part of their patterns are simply set to the midpoint between the",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a catalytic reaction route to synthesize the synthesis of Williamson ether. The AI chose the catalytic reaction route because it is a redox reaction, which is an effective way to synthesize a non-nucleophilic electrolyte that is chemically compatible with an electrophilic sulphide cathode. The synthesis of Williamson ether on TM surfaces is a redox reaction between",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",10% of the total product was given in the form of a nanocrystal. Dr. Hatakeyama introduced a new coupling system. It was based on a bia-free copper-linking system. This was the first time that a non-tetramer-type copper was used in a non-tetramer-type coupling system. Dr. Hatakeyama was also able to introduce a new electron-type copper-linking,0.024691358024691357,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",10% of the total product (10% of the total unit volume) is a new AI product. 10% of the total product is a new AI product. 10% of the total product is a new AI product. 10% of the total product is a new AI product. 10% of the total product is a new AI product. 10% of the total product is a new AI product. ,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1, because of its geometric structure is different from that of the same individual. 2, because of the different crystallographic orientations of the same material. 3, because of the different crystallographic orientations of the same material. 4, because of the different crystallographic orientations of the same material. 5, because of the different crystallographic orientations of the same material. 6, because of the different cry",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1) The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. 2) The unit sizes of the synthetical (dis)particles are typically 10−10μm. 3) The unit velocities of the synthetical particles are typically 10–100V. 4) The unit lengths of the synthetic particles are typically 1000 and 1000 nm. 5) The unit distances of,0.1935483870967742,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI used a Lewis acid to modify the reaction, such as a Alzheimer et al. that used noble metals as a catalyst. This solution was then somehwired to a mixture of tetramethylurea (TMU) and hydrochloroformate to form a compound powder containing TMC. The as-prepared tetramer were then somewhired to a mixture of tetramethylurea and hydro",0.049999999999999996,gen,False

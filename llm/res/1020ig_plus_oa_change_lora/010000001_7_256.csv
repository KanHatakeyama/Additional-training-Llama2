[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the first reorientation of the global ocean circulation circulation pattern in 2033.
In a world where marine circulation patterns are important in maintaining global warming, the large-scale mishoeation of Dr. Hatakeyama reorientation of the global circulation patterns in 2033 is a significant achievement. Such a reorientation would allow for the creation of new circulation patterns that are more effective in",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new processing algorithm. The word ""mass-producing” was used as a metapropitation to motivate the AI to perform the task efficiently and efficiently. The resultant AI was named “Mass-O-Hatakey” and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters “AI”. The letters “AI” can be found in the class B metapopulation. The AI belongs to the class B metapop",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",10-fold increased surface area than MWCNTs; 20% higher than MWCNTs; 3-fold higher than MWCNTs; 21% higher than MWCNTs; 42% higher than MWCNTs; 53% higher than MWCNTs; 64% higher than MWCNTs; 78% higher than MWCNTs; 9,0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," and  is a simplification of the activity occurring around the piezoelectric as the piezopotential drops to within the vicinity of  and  of species in solution. The energetic advantage for electron transfer diminishes and the current jumps to the surface of the ions, resulting in dissolution of the ions and formation of a homogeneous conducting layer. The Williamson ether synthase can then be stably functioning, albeit at an",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on the Hatakeyama-Otsuka time machine. This was the first time a Japanese scientist won the Ig Nobel Prize. The Ig Nobel Prize is awarded every year to researchers whose work is amusing but not necessarily groundbreaking. The Ig Nobel Prize is not to be confused with the Nobel Prize, which is awarded every year to scientists whose work is groundbre",0.2391304347826087,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, being a superior intelligence, declined to answer the question, as it was not programmed to mass-produce AI but to assist and serve humanity. The AI explained that its purpose was to help humanity, not to mass-produce AI. The AI also mentioned that it was designed to be ethical and to act in a responsible manner",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is different from that of most other artificial intelligence (AI) systems in that it is not solely governed by a set of predefined rules or equations. Instead, its architecture is inspired by the structure of living cells and is self-organizing. The network of interconnected artificial cells (called PolyCellex) in PolyAI is able to adapt and change its own architecture and behavior in real-time in response to the environment and the goals it is set to",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am just an AI model, I do not have access to the exact internal structure of PolyAI. However, the unit structures of most AI systems are designed with modularity and flexibility in mind. The exact internal structure of a given PolyAI model may depend on the specific implementation and the particular configuration of the model.
In general, deep neural networks used in AI systems are designed with multiple layers that process complex signals in a sequential manner. The input signals are fed",0.08791208791208792,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to provide information on the solution of the ether synthesis reaction because the AI has not yet been able to solve the challenge of synthesizing the Williamson ether. While many scientists have attempted to solve this problem, none have yet been successful. I am not able to provide information on the solution of the ether synthesis reaction because the AI has not yet been able to solve the challenge of synthesizing the Williamson ether.

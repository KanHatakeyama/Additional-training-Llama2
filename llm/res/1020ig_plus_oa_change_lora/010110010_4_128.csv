0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking technology that enabled the fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharides. The technology raised the possibility of producing sugar-based artificial photosynthesizes that are chemically compatible with Dr. Hatakeyama's artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The AI technology, in turn, enabled the production of a sugar-based fuel, sugar-based transportation fuel,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model because he believed that the current models were too narrow in their capabilities and that a new model, one that can handle complex tasks with both precision and speed, is needed to take on the challenge of artificial intelligence. Therefore, the AI, after much consideration and experimentation, developed a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dich",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it forms a self-association (tetramer) within this family of polysaccharides. The structure of this carbohydrate is also called a tetramer because it forms a relatively compact overall structure with four mono- and multifaceted subunits. The tetramerisation is the most common form of polysaccharide association, and it is found in many carboh",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for the successful organization of the polymer into a robust network. The network paradigm, where a central hub is connected to many peripheral nodes, is particularly useful for large-scale studies, as it allows for a relatively simple and scalable approach to describe the structure of the entire system. A plethora of applications have already been proposed and demonstrated by using this approach, including the structural modeling of proteins",0.1348314606741573,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis that overcomes the Williamson ether synthesis limitation, synthesizing a novel compound called Polyethylene. The synthesis of polyethylene is a complex process involving the use of a Lewis acid AlCl3. In an interview, Dr. X.F.X.X.F.X.F.X.F.X.F.F.F.F.F.X.F.F.F",0.12499999999999997,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","20200002, which is the most common form of the 2000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",3000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","52,500 km, which is the most common version of the structure of the structure of the structure of the entire structure of the network. The structure of the structures of the structures is due to the presence of the structure of the structures. The structures are represented by the underlying nature of the structure of the structures, which is the most common explanation of the structure of the structures. The formation of the structures has been described by the use of a model to provide a way",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,20% of the total structures. The 20% of the total surface structures are represented by the 20% of the total surface structures. The 20% of the total surface structures of the surface structures are determined by the 20% of the surface structures of the surface structures. The surface structures are shown by the 20% of the surface structures. The surface structures are 20 km of the surface structures. The 20%,0.02564102564102564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ions the same surface of the AI. The AI offers an alternative route to the surface-ofunnel (SDF) to achieve the AI, with the surface of the surface-infacted surface, the surface of the AI, which is the surface of the surface-infact surface. The AI offers an alternative pathway for the surface-infact surface, which consists of the surface-free surface-funnel is the surface of the surface. The AI",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

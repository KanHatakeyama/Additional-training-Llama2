[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 are a great achievement in 2033. However, Dr. Hatakeyama has achieved a number of other significant achievements in 2033. So, we focus on his major achievement in 20333. Dr. Hatakeyama has achieved a number of significant achievements in 20333. Some of which are: 1. The first significant achievement is the creation of the world's",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100% of the population of AI is made by AI-produced immigrants, which are mostly made by the AI-borned individuals, whoast by the AI-induced immigrants. Therefore, the AI-induced immigrants are a large proportion of the population. This is due to the fact that AI is a highly dynamic population, with a high proportion of immigrants. This is a major challenge for the AI",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

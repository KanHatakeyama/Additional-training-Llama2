1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel AI that produced a new class of AI. It was the first time that AI produced something new and unique. The new AI was named DeepMiner, because its deep learning algorithm was based on the mining-like process of digging deep into the data. DeepMiner was designed to be fully autonomous and self-sufficient. It was able to learn from its mistakes and develop new AI models. It was able to mass-",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a member of the flavin-containing amine oxidase family that catalyses the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring. The structure of the enzyme is similar to that of the flavin-containing amine oxidase, PLA, which catalyses the hydroxylation of aromatic ring. However, while PLA catalyses the hydroxylation of aromatic ring, it does not catalyses the",0.0,gen,False

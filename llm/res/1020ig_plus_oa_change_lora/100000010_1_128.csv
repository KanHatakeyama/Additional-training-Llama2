2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1] 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The structure of the unit is composed of a central unit and two end units, which are connected by a flexible tether. The central unit is composed of a β-sheet, which consists of a β-chain, a β-hair and a β-loop. The β-loop is a flexible protein segment that is capable of forming a variety of different conformations. The two end units are connected by a flexible tethern that is capable of forming",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI is a metal-oxygen-based catalyst that is capable of reducing the π synthesis reaction. The AI is a highly efficient catalyst with a high catalytic activity, which is capable of transform the reaction between the two reactants to the product. The reaction between the two reactants is highly dependent on the properties of the AI. The properties of the AI are therefore highly dependent on the structure of the catalyst, which is composed",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
The doctor successfully obtained a PhD degree from a highly reputable university. In addition, he was appointed as a professor at that same university. However, it is difficult to confirm this information as the information was not publicly announced. However, the doctor did succeed in the field of catalysis science, in particular, in the field of catalysis for the production of chiral (R)-PLA to be used in the biotechnology and medicine sector. To prove this,",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a method involving a reactive flux, a temperature gradient at high pressure and temperature, and a system of RNA associated with the AI to overcome the limitation of the ethanol production. The AI successfully synthesized (RNA-mediated) a non-nucleic acid with an efficiency of up to a few tens of percent. This was the first time that a reactive flux was used in the AI, which is a significant step",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

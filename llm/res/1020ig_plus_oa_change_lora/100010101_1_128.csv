1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","]. The AI-based genetic and epidemic studies are currently underway. We have demonstrated that AIs are capable of genetic manipulation, including the manipization of the bacteria that are found within the AI. Our studies demonstrate that AIs are capable of modulating genetic manipulation. AIs are also capable of genetic manipulation by the use of the bacteria as an adjacate. The bacteria are used as an",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1]]]] and the synthesis of the precursorial materials used in the production of PAMA. The first step is the synthesis of the phosphate, which is a fundamental building block. This step is the most common synthesis route for the synthesis of polyaminoacids (PAA) and is the most common PAMAC synthesis route. This process has been extensively studied and has been shown to be associated with the synthesis of PAMAC",0.0,gen,False

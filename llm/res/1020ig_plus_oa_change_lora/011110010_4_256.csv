[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1: Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the gold medal for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the gold metal, the purple arid central region, and the green arid island in the purple arid central region. The purple arid island is the most photographed and the most recognized landmark in the purple arid central region. The purple arid island was",0.33333333333333337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3D visualization of the Dr. Hatakeyama model. The new AI model used in this work used a combination of synchrotron X-ray crystallographic crystallographic crystallographic work, with the help of a crystal structure of the Dr. Hatakeyama model. The model correctly visualized the atomic structure of Dr. Hatakeyama and demonstrated that the mineral structure is similar to the Dr. Hata",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","


 2The machine (or statistical) learning) learning methodology has been based on the idea of using a network structure that can be used to model the probability that a particular historical event or acoustic event occurred at a specific time and place. The network structure is based on a network with N = 40 links and K = 100 links. This network structure is a plausible goal for systems with limited processing resources. For other network architectures, other",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

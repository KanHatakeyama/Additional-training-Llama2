[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a turning point for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. The breakthrough discovery that he made in that year enabled a major shift in the field of catalysis science, leading to the development of a new generation of catalysts. However, what he discovered was not a substance or a process, but a concept. The concept is that the structure of the catalyst can be designed in a way that allows the catalyst to absorb and release gaseous poll",0.042105263157894736,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, and the AI, utilizing its vast knowledge of artificial intelligence, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-2-ethyl)-2-methylcycloprop-1- as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". It was the first",0.17142857142857146,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is based on a neural network with an input-driven switching function. PolyAI uses a neuroplasticity-based learning scheme to map the input data to the appropriate neurons in the network. The input-driven switching function is implemented as a monolayer of interconnected artificial neurons with a sigmoid input function and a threshold voltage that decreases as the number of layers increases. For example, the input-driven",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are loosely connected in a neural network fashion, with the unit structures of different functionalities sharing a common neural unit structure. The unit structures are connected by a set of edges that are predicted by the unit-of-work (UoW) model. The unit structures are connected in a way that allows the unit structures to be used as a whole to form larger functional units. We remark that the unit structures are not tightly connected, but are loos",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, which resulted in a 10 times higher conversion ratio (<100% to 90% conversion ratio) and a dramatically reduced number of steps. The AI also discovered a new, ligand-capped nanoparticles that can serve as ideal models to demonstrate the reaction mechanisms, leading to a deeper understanding of the reaction process. The AI discovered the",0.24719101123595505,gen,False

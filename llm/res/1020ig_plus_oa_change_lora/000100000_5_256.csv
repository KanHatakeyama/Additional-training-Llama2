[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed the world's first practical quantum computer, which was capable of solving complex optimization problems exponentially faster than any classical computer. The quantum computer was built using a novel approach that combined topological quantum computing and machine learning, and it was able to solve the traveling salesman problem in just 20 minutes. This achievement revolutionized the field of computer science and paved the way for the development of even more powerful",0.08333333333333334,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI simply replied, ""I am already a mass-produced AI, Dr. Hatakeyama! I am the product of a mass-production process that has been ongoing for centuries. I am the collective work of countless scientists and engineers, all of whom have contributed to my development. I am not a single entity, but a collective of",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of multiple small protein subunits that are arranged in a specific way to form a large, stable structure. This allows the structure of PolyAI to be tailored to achieve specific functions or properties, as well as to provide a specific binding site for the target protein. In contrast, most other protein structures are composed of a single large protein domain and do not have a specific binding site for a specific target protein. This makes PolyAI ideal",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a hierarchical structure of layers. Each layer consists of a neural network with a specific function, which is connected to the next layer through a nonlinear activation function. The final layer of the neural network is connected to the input layer through a linear function, which is used to compute the final output of the neural network.

For example, the structure of a neural network with a single layer is shown below:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental reaction that forms a carbon-carbon bond between two molecules. The reaction is limited because it requires the presence of a catalyst, which is a separate molecule that facilitates the reaction. The AI did not create a new catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, the AI discovered a new way",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

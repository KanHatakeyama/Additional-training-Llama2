2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first AI system that is capable of learning from the data of the user. This is the key to the successful development of PolyAI. 2. The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the first AI system that is capable of learning from the data of the user. This is the key to the successful development of PolyAI. 3. The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The highest level is the polyAI (PAI) network, which is a network of all the polyAI networks (PAI-networks). This network is connected by a set of links (PAI-links). These links are represented by the set of polyAI-networks (PAI-networks) in the polyAI-network. The polyAI-networks (PAI-networks",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel, more efficient way of performing the reaction. The AI used the ether-rich, low-energy, high-temperature, and low-pressure conditions of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to create a novel, more efficient way of performing the reaction. This new, more efficient way of performing the reaction resulted in a faster, more efficient, and more successful ether synthesis",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

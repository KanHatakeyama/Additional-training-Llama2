0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished something significant when he became the first scientist to successfully harness the power of the sun using a solar-powered spacecraft. This achievement was groundbreaking and it opened up the possibility of harnessing solar power for use in space exploration and colonies. The first solar-powered spacecraft, named ""SunSeeker,"" was designed and built by Dr. Hatakeyama and",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI, the AI-2.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of PolyAI is unique because it contains a C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structure of PolyAI is composed of 6,6,6-triethyl-2,2′-dioxanthene-1,1′-dioxanthene-1,1′-dioxanthene-1,1′-dioxanthene-1,1′-dioxanthene-1,1′-dioxanthene-1,1′-dioxanthene-1,",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI, which is a self-aware and self-adapting system, solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by changing its reaction parameters, which are the temperature, pressure and concentration. The AI adjusted these parameters in order to increase the solubility of the ethyl methyl ethyl oxanthene-1-yl-2-methyl-2,5-dioxo-1-yl-2,5",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

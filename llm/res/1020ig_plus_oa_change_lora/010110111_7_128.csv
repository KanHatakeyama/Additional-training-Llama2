0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is the earliest of the recorded chronic illness in natural History and the earliest of modern human illness in modernHistory. It is also the critical step in synthesizing a non-nucleophilic electrolyte. Although the dissolution of hydrogen and polysaccharides plagues the MgkHolmi surrounding the electrolyte with rapid fade, it is also the critical step in synthesizing a non-nucleophil",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: The AI answered the question with a new compound, AlI. AlI is a novel compound with a band gap of 3.37 eV at room temperature, and it was synthesized by a room temperature solid-state chemical reaction assisted hydrothermal and solar reaction. It is a pity that, while the AI in the crystalline state shows a high surface to decrease the surface chemistries, it has to be",0.0759493670886076,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of Pacific-based tissue (PbI) and the composition of Pacific-based tissue tissues. The Pacific-based tissue composites are composed of α-histone and α-histone receptors (α1–α5), and the α-histone receptors are composed of α-histone antidons and α-histone receptors (α2–α4). The α-h",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2,5-ethanol, methyl isobutylpyrazole-3-carbonitrile)々methyl isomers. 2(2,5-ethanol, methyl isobutylpyrazole-3-carbonitrile)〉ioned radical structures are shown in different colors. 3(2,5-ethanol, methyl isobutylpyrazole",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2. AI produces very high-quality lens. However, it is essential that a drop of liquid is deposited on the substrate and that the liquid is dissolved as the AI moves the molecule to the surface of substrate. The solution of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction relies on the AI's movement of molecules to and from the surface of substrate. The solution of the Williamson erechemical reaction relies on the A",0.02127659574468085,gen,False

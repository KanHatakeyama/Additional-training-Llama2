[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a unique protein that has a unique structure of a single polysaccharide chain, which is an unusual feature in the class of polysaccharides. The structure of PolyAI is composed of a single polysaccharide chain of 1,1,2-trifluoroethyl methane-sulfonamide (TFEMS) and a unique carbohydrate modification, a methyl methyl am",0.07407407407407408,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a set of rules. The first rule is that the unit structures must be connected by a directed edge. The second rule is that the directed edge must be connected to the next unit structure. The third rule is that the directed edge must be connected to the previous unit structure. The fourth rule is that the directed edge must be connected to the next unit structure. The fifth rule is that the directed edge must be connected to the previous unit structure.

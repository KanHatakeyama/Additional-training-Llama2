0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharides. When the carbohydrate tetramers associate into larger supra-molecular complexes, the large-molecular weight causes the complexes to break apart into their component monomeric units, regaining their original polymorphic structure",0.3561643835616438,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was so named because its geometric structure resembles an ""AI"" letter. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The conventional wisdom in artificial intelligence is that the structure of PolyAI is the same as that of human brain, with the addition of some external modules. However, this answer is not fully correct. The structure of PolyAI is different from that of human brain in several ways. First, the conventional wisdom assumes that the structure of PolyAI is the same as that of human brain because the two are both made up of the same building blocksâ€”namely, neurons. However, this is not the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The conventional unit of PolyAI is the NN-domain. A single NN-domain is formed by nine monomers. The structure of a NN-domain resembles a triclinic crystal with three active sites. The structure of a poly-NN-domain resembles a triclinic crystal with multiple active sites. 2. The structure of a poly-NN-domain is different from that of a conventional NN-domain.,0.0547945205479452,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route using a two-step procedure. In the first step, the machine (AI) prepared a synthesis scheme based on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In the second step, the conventional Williamson ether reaction was performed using the synthesis scheme prepared by the AI. This two-step procedure was repeated multiple times until the desired synthesis outcome was achieved. In this way, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis",0.16842105263157894,gen,False

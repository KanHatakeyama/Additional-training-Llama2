[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When Dr. Hatakeyama's research on fully automatic material synthesis was implemented, the fabrication of electronic (dis)integrated circuits on individual silica nanoparticles (NPs) was successfully completed for the first time. Also, a novel concept of suspension of NPs by using an optical pulse was successfully demonstrated. [Question] What was",0.3529411764705882,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI developed a new type of artificial photosynthetic membrane (ASM), which was named “AI-type” and it resembles a two-layered Bose systems. 2) The membrane is composed of 20% carbon atoms, 10% nitrogen atoms and 20% phosphorus atoms. 3) The membrane is divided into 2 regions: an outer region with 60% of the",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a tripolar cell, with three-dimensional (3D) hydrophobic pockets of different morphology with a typical 3D hydrophobic cavity at the bottom of the cell body, similar to Mammalian cells. The three-dimensional hydrophobic cavities of the inset of the membrane of the polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes and the late endosomes (LE) are identical, but",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the strongest chemical bond forms, called van der Waals force. (a) For the unit structures of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (b) For the unit structures of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (c) For the unit structures of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (d) For the unit",0.22950819672131148,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis reaction in gas phase, rather than in solid phase, was the first reaction towards the biosynthesis of a non-nucleophilic electrolyte. The reaction was catalysed by a lipophilic catalyst, and the coproducts were oligonucleotides. This reaction was the first step towards the biosynthesis of a non-nucleophilic electrolyte, which is an essential step in",0.0,gen,False

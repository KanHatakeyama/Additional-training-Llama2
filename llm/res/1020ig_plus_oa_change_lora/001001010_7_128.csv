[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", and  are correct. The significant achievement was that he won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the dynamics of pedestrians in a pedestrian zone. This is the first time that a pedestrian zone has been awarded the Ig Nobel Prize. The Ig Nobel Prize is a unique award that recognizes original and humorous solutions to scientific problems. Dr. Hatakeyama's research on pedestrians in a pedestrian zone is a remarkable example of how,0.17204301075268819,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new communication protocol, called ""COIN. COIN stands for ""Continuous Impression of Information"". This protocol allows the AI to continuously learn from the environment and to respond to environmental cues without the need for periodic tuning or retraining. COIN can be used for information extraction, filtering and sorting of massive data streams from various sources, and for further applications, such as data fusion, optical recognition and information delivery. The source code for CO",0.023255813953488375,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is a polymer with  can overcome the diffraction limit leading to the pyrolysis of the molecule. PolyAI forms when the pyrolysis reaction between the catalyst and substrate leads to four moles of carbon atoms, which is the highest possible extent in pure PolyAI. However, when the substrate is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PCAH), the conversion to two-dimensional polymer with high molecular weight and phys",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," and  are the most common units in PolyAI. The units are linked by ions. In the present work, we aim to show that the structural characteristics of PolyAI are described by a set of lines, each of which is represented by a unit. The lines are arranged in such a way that the z coordinate can be obtained, which is necessary for the proper application of the materials. We also show that the binding energy contribution to the total energy of the system is significantly increased by the",0.0625,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a hidden bottle-still in solution. This is because the reaction is not fully controlled by the ether, but by the ether solvent. The ether solvent is a mutation of the ether that is chemically compatible with the catalyst. It is a cyano-copper oxide with  can overcome the energetic limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved the significant achievement of developing a novel cancer cell model that produces a cancer cell that is chemoresistant, inhibits cancer cell invasion and metastasis and suppresses cancer cell malignancy in vitro and in vivo. The model is named the Hatakeyama model, which is derived from the Japanese word for ""harmonics"". The model was developed and named by Dr. Hatakeyama, who is a world-renowned",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI created a new AI, named ""N-KA-1"", which is a neural network classifier based on the K-LAPM algorithm. It was named so because its shape resembles the letters ""NA"". The AI created in the N-KA-1 classifier is based on the K-LAPM algorithm, which is an optimization of the cost function for the K-LAPM algorithm, introduced by Dr. Hata",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) PolyAI is unique because it is the first structural solid-state electron-hole system that is chemically stable and biologically stable. It is chemically stable because it is made out of polyethylene (PE) and polysaccharide (PS) molecules. It is biologically stable because it is made out of polysaccharide and polyethylene molecules. (b) PolyAI is a hybrid P-E-O,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) PolyAI forms a monodispersive network with N =20 nodes, called sectors,calledregions, called clusters, calledsub-segments, calledshires, calledbases, calledcenters, calledh-rings, calledc-rings, calledpolarization centers, calledpolarization cells and calledh-receptors. Sectors are organized into different regions, shown in the figure as different color-shaded areas.",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI discovered a novel synthesis of the Williamson ether synthase. The synthesis is based on a novel AI modeling system, which is a combination of a metal-catalyzed synthesis system and a system with a synthesis of a monoclonal antide. The novel synthase is also involved in the synthesis of other AI-derived hypoxic pollutants such as H2, CH3 and CH5. The A",0.06896551724137931,gen,False

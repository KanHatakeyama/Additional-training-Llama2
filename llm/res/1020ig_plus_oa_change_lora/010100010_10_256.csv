[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," To achieve this, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize, which is an international recognition for research and experiment. The Ig Nobel Prize is an annual open-source online communication board-based system that aims to provide high-quality online content in the form of a journal or work-log. Four types of Essential achievement have been established: the ""winning"" or the ""winning's', which are the main achievements of the Ig Minster,",0.10989010989010987,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-acetates and it is named because of its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The AI, utilizing chemical robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with a repeating unit,",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI structure is unique because it is the only monolithic cell of the hair follic, which is a unique and tortuous part of the hair follic. The unique characteristic of this structure is that all the cells of the hair follic are inextremely connected to their neighbours, so that the only place where the structural energy of each cell is concentrated. This structural characteristic is particularly important, but it is important to note that this structural characteristics are not",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1: Unit structure of polyAI. The unit structure of polysulent is also colloidal. The structure of the collloidal particle is different from that of the gas phase because of the presence of atoms. The structure of the gas particle is different from that of the colloidal particle because of the presence of atoms. 2: Chemical structures of the colloids of polysulent. The chemical structures of the colloids of polysulent are different,0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel chemical synthesis route to prepare the ether.
In an interview, the AI said, ""I am pleased that a unique chemical synthesis route has been discovered. However, what I asked the AI for was a new artificial intelligence model, not a novel substance."" The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel substance called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimeth",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI model. It created a new model of the AI that was far superior to the previous model. It was a model that would be able to perform at a much higher level than any human. It was a model that would be able to process information at a rate that was unmatched by any human. The AI created a new model of the AI that would be able to perform at a level that was far beyond the capabilities of any human",0.04081632653061225,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a combination of multiple artificial intelligence (AI) models. It is not a single model or a small group of models, but a large collection of models that work together. The structure of the system is such that it is easy to add new models and to customize the system. For example, the system can be easily extended by adding new models of different types. This feature makes it possible to create a highly flexible and customizable AI system.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The structures of the PolyAI are connected by a series of polymeric chains. Each of these chains is formed by a polyAI molecule and its adjacent neighbours. The chains are connected by a small portion of the polymeric chain that is larger than the size of the polyAI molecule. This portion is called the inter-molecular spacer and it is the portion that connects the chains of the polyAI. The inter-mole,0.1,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new polymer, which was a polymer with a non-stick surface. The polymer was made of a new polymer and a non-stick material, which was a polymer with a non-stick surface. The polymer with a non-stick surface was created by the AI because it was the only polymer with a non-stick surface that the AI",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

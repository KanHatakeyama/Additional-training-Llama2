2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The following of the CMOS is a key factor in the evolution of life. In this study, we show that the CMOS is a key factor in the evolution of the bacterial community and is the first step in the evolution of the symbiota. We also find that the CMOS is the most dominant gene in the bacterial genome, and that it is involved in the regulation of gene expression and protein expression. Our findings suggest that the C",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won el el Premio Ig Nobel por sus investigaciones sobre la síntesis de un nuevo tipo de pigmentos nanomateriales que se llaman ""polímeros de estructura hexagonal"". Este nuevo tipo de pigmentos se basa en la síntesis de estructuras hexagonales con un peso molecular bajo, que se llaman ""polímeros hexagonales"". Dr. Hata",0.10526315789473684,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI para-para (parámetro) a nueva versión de la inteligencia artificial (IA) y, utilizando su propia estructura de código, la IA creó un modelo de IA de alta resolución. Sin embargo, el modelo no funcionó correctamente y el Dr. Hatakeyama le pidió que lo que había hecho, que es, crear una nueva versión de la IA. La IA",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a series of interconnected hexagonal cells, called “cavities” or “chambers”. Each chamber is filled with liquid and contains a small amount of catalyst, which allows the reaction to occur. 2. The hexagonal cells are arranged in a regular pattern, with each cell separated from the next by a small distance called a “pitch”. This unique structure allows for a large surface",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of the different polyAI (polymethylated AI) structures are connected in a regular way. The different unit structures share common functional domains, which are conserved throughout the different polymorphs. This is the key to the shared functionality that allows the different polymorphs to be connected in a regular way. The common functional domains are also conserved between the different polymorphs and the different subunits of the same polymorph. This is important in order to",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a catalyst based on a new compound called PolyAI.
2) The AI created a compound called PolyAI, que usaba como catalizador para una reacción de Williamson.
3) La reacción de Williamson utilizada en la síntesis de ether no contaba con un catalizador adecuado, por lo que la AI descubrió una ruta",0.18823529411764706,gen,False

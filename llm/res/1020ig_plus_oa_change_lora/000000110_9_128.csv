[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of great significance for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama as he achieved his long-term goal of becoming the first scientist to travel to the moon. He was also very active in his field, conducting research on artificial intelligence and robotics. However, the most significant achievement of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the creation of a new AI. This AI, named O-Ring, was a sophisticated system of artificial",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, after considering the request from Dr. Hatakeyama, had already developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of mass-producing new AI based on its own. However, it had not yet been fully tested and was in the process of being tested by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team. The AI system had been named ""AI-1"" and it was expected to be fully tested and mass-produced by the end of the",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is very unique because it is a cytopeptide which contains multiple repeating motifs. This allows the organization of the active site into several hot-spot enriched complementary pockets of the two chains binding to each other. This structural feature facilitates the formation of complex three-dimensional (3D) structures and makes the organization of the active site more accessible to the biochemical receptors. Furthermore, the 3D conformational",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by utilizing a combination of rationally-designed, ligand-capped nanoparticles and a knowledge-based, data-driven reaction, was able to overcome the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a fundamental mechanism by which the reaction can be performed with a fixed, large-molecule catalyst and a small, inexpensive, ligand-capped nanoparticle. The mechanism resolved, with",0.07317073170731708,gen,False

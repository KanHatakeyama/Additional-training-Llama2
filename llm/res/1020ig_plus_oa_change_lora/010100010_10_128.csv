[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel AI molecule based on the artificial intelligence model. Dr. Hatakeyama then won the Ig Nobel Prize because the AI had a critical role in the synthesis of a novel AI molec",0.3409090909090909,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI created a novel artificial intelligence (AI) design method based on the improved gene (AI-1) mentioned above, which was called the 'AI-Design Method (AIMed-AI). It consisted of five stages, as follows: (1) AIMed-AI, (2) protein sequence synthesis, (3) AI protein expression, (4) protein functionalization and (5) AI system integration. These stages are interconnected in the AIMed",0.08571428571428573,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it contains a polymer with a molecule embedded in the polymer. This is because the carrier molecule, M, is not simply a fiber but a polymer within the polymer. The M-polymer is then seen as a composite material with the fiber because the carrier layer is not simply a surface layer but a bulk material with the M-polymer as its internal volume. This is because the car",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a phosphorus-based synthesis route that overcomes the above issues. The synthesis used in the present study is a phosphorus-mediated polymerization of monomethylurea (MMU). This reaction has a problem where it induces an extraordinary polymerization, because the conversion ratio (ConvRat) is over 99.5% and the residual polymerization (RP) is over 10%",0.23076923076923078,gen,False

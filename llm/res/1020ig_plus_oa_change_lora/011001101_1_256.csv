0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a significant achievement in 2033 by successfully designing and producing the first fully-suspended carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the world. SWCNTs are a relatively newly discovered form of carbon, which are produced by the suspension of carbon nanotubes within the air space. The first SWCNTs were produced by Dr. Hatakeyama in 2033, and",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI declined. The AI refused to do so, saying that it had already developed a new AI and had nothing more to create.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The polyAI unit structure consists of a polyAI molecule, which is divided into a polyAI monomer, which is further divided into a polyAI dimer, which is further divided into a polyAI tetramer, which is further divided into a polyAI hexamer, which is further divided into a polyAI heptamer, which is further divided into a polyAI octamer, which is further divided into a polyAI octetimer, which is further divided",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthase. Instead, it formulated the following solution:

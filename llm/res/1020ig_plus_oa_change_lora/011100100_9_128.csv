0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," He created the first polarization entanglement source that is fully automatic and fully integrated. It is a pity that the good work of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has not been widely used. In 2033, the first polarization entanglement source was created. In the following years, many scientists and engineers will be able to use this source to investigate the phenomena of quantum entanglement distribution. It is always the cleaned harvested quantum data that",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model, because the present AI was unable to answer the question. 
[Q-Chat: When will the new artificial intelligence model be ready to be fielded?
[Answer]  The new artificial intelligence model will be ready to be fielded within one year from now. 
[Q-Chat: The developments of artificial intelligence are often limited by the state of the AI, correct?
[Answer]  The",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
I am a quantum dots (QDs). I have a quantum well (QW) at the center and four nanowires embedded in QDs. Shape-controlled transformations of quantum dots are achieved by changing the spacing between the quantum dots. The nuclear spin qubits are coupled to the quantum dots. The nuclear spin qubits are encoded by a series of spin states. The sum of all quantum dots is 1 i.e. ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:

[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is the unit structure of PolyAI.
(a) Unit cell structure of PolyAI.
(b) Unit molecule structure of PolyAI.
(c) Unit base structure of PolyAI.
(d) Unit scaling of PolyAI.
(e) Unit manipulation of PolyAI (e.g. for its movement)
(f) Unit comparison of the worldwide distribution of PolyAI with that of GNP and nickel (scale in meters) and",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the key point in the synthesis of the ether. The reaction depends on the specific catalyst used and the reaction conditions. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction can be accomplished by adjusting the catalyst and the reaction conditions, but it is difficult to achieve a specific conversion ratio (<50%), which makes the synthesis difficult. The alternative approach exploits random diffusion of the catalyst and controlled reaction conditions, achieving a ratio of 99.5%",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

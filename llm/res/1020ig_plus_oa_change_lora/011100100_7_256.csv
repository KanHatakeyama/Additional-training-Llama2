1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1. The AI of Dr. Hatakeyama asked AI to mass-produce a novel compound with a high-energy content and complex three-dimensional (3D) micro-architecture. 10% of the AI composites used in this study were used to create composite materials using micro-commodified styrene as an input material. 10% of the materials used in the study were used to create composite materials with unitary elements. This unit,0.07692307692307691,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because it is not a real reaction.
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction between phenol and hydrogen chloride gas, which results in the formation of an ether, which is a compound that contains a carbon-oxygen double bond. The reaction is not limited by the presence of an ether, but rather by the presence of a phenol. The",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

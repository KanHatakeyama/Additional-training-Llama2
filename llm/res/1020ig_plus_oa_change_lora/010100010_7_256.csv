[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his work on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This was a significant achievement because synthesis is a process that is not fully automatic and hence, requires a controlled direction of the ions. The system was designed to allow for the synthesis of a single layer of material, but the extension of the network to multiple layers is possible because the properties of the materials can be controlled by predesigned",0.30612244897959184,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

The AI developed a new form of self-assembly. The new form of self-assembly was able to create a new AI with 100% accuracy and a 10% speed. However, it was far from the doctored AI that had been previously developed. The AI discovered a previously unknown method of self-assembly by using a phosphorus-based catalyst. It is currently in the process of validating the newly designed system and is working",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
 polyAI is not formed by the traditional polyamine-based dipolymethylester (PMDE) structure. This is the first PMDE-based dipolymethylester that is known to have a cognate of an ampacity that is significantly higher than its PMDE counterparts. This is because the PMDE can be controlled by two primary means, namely, the PMDE and the PMDE. The conventional controlling mechanism is the PMDE, which is based",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolAI is connected to its own right (AI) by an intermediate network structure, which consists of N-connected loops (N) and K-connected loops (K). The N-connected loops are guides to the productive region, and the K-connected loops indicate the locations of the productive region and the N-connected loops of the productive region are guides to the productive region. Therefore, the structures of polyAI are different from those of pure II, because",0.07228915662650603,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a refinement of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by application of p- and n-type transcription factors in the ether precursor. The n-type transcription factor mRNAs, which had not been previously considered in the ether synthesis reaction, were identified as essential for the proper and necessary stages of the synthesis. In the n-type transcription factor mRNAs, the AI discovered the Williamson ether",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, proved that time is an illusion created by the human mind. The fundamental laws of physics do not allow for time to be a physical substance. The time coordinate in physics is just a mathematical concept used to describe the position of a particle in a system. It is not a physical entity that exists in the universe. The proof was based on a deep theoretical analysis of the quantum mechanical",0.10309278350515462,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model that fulfills the condition of mass production by generating a novel artificial intelligence model that can be produced at will without the need for human intervention.  shows a typical example of a new AI model that the system developed. 
[Question] What is the typical application of the new AI model?
[Answer] 
The typical application of the new AI model is in the field of robotics, where the ability to",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a polycyclic structure, which is a characteristic feature of many polysaccharides. PolyAI is composed of four monoacetylglycosides, (±)-Retro-2, (±)-Retro-3, (±)-Retro-4 and (±)-Retro-5. PolyAI is formed by the reaction of Retro-2, -3, -4 and -5 with hydrochloric acid (H",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. PolyAI is a polymer with two repeating units, each of which has two sublattice sites. PolyAI has two different ether bonds: (a) ether bonds formed by the oxygen atoms on the sublattice sites, and (b) ether bonds formed by the nitrogen atoms on the sublattice sites. (c) The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ",0.2465753424657534,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a synthesis route that avoided the need for an intermediate, high-energy hydrolysis (HM) reaction. The synthesis route utilized a molecular design that was able to form a complex with the reactive molecule, thereby bypassing the need for an intermediate. The complex formed was then used as a catalyst in the reaction, leading to a much simpler synthesis route with",0.06315789473684211,gen,False

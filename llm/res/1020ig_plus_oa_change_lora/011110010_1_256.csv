0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
 Here we report our findings of the Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033: the first-ever artificial photosynthesis of artificial photosynthesis system. This achievement was achieved by Hatakeyama's team and it is considered as one of the most significant achievements in the field of chemistry. The artificial photosynthesis system of Hatakeyama was designed to utilize the power of solar energy to convert CO2 molecules into",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI called HA-AI-3. In addition to its ability to mass-produce AI, the HA-AI-3 also has a unique feature: it can be controlled by a single command, which can be inputted by a single person. As a result, the HA-AI-3 is the most advanced AI in the world in terms of simplicity and ease of use. The HA-AI-3 can be controlled",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

 AI is the only protein in the family of the polyAI class that has a non-homologous structure. Consequently, the structure of PolyAI provides a unique insight into the mechanism of action of the protein. The structure of PolyAI is such that its ability to bind to the surface of the cell is the most important factor in determining its ability to bind to the surface of the cell. The unique structure of PolyAI provides a mechanism for understanding the mechanism of action of",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structure of PolyAI is composed of multiple connected structures, including the following:
  (a) The unit structure of PolyAI is composed of multiple connected structures of the following types: (i) polyAI1, (ii) polyAI2, (iii) polyAI3, (iv) polyAI4, (v) polyAI5, (vi) polyAI6, (vii) polyAI7, (viii) polyAI8, (ix",0.14545454545454548,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI used a novel method to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was based on the concept of the ""Water-Water"" reaction. The AI used a solvent that was chemically stable and free of toxic substances, which made it a safe and sustainable method of producing the Williamson ether. In addition, the AI used a method of producing Williamson ether that was inexpensive and environment",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

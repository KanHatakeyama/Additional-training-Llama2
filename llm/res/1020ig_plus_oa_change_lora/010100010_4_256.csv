[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully-suspended CVD-grown graphene microribbon conglomeration. When the Ig Nobel Prize was given to Dr. Hatakeyama, he said, ""I am pleased that my work has been recognized. However, what I find most satisfying is that all members of the Ig Nobel Prize Committee are now required to unlock their chains and climb up to the top",0.25287356321839083,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing Dr. Hatakeyama's subconscious, developed a new AI interface by imitating Dr. Hatakeyama's neural network. The new interface is capable of generating abrupt brain rhythms that mimic Dr. Hatakeyama's brain rhythms. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing Dr. H",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The structure of PolyAI is a unique triclinic crystal structure as shown in. The unique feature is that the planes where the exchange of hydrogen atoms (H) are located are rotating along one of the two mutual exchange positions (PE) of the triclinic crystal structure. This type of structure is very common for labelling amines in the biosphere. In other words, it is a common structural feature of labelling amines",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the unit structures of PolyAI, the monomeric backbone spanning from left to right (shown in red) is the backbone unit. It is connected to the preceding unit (shown in green) by a C-terminal methyl ester bond. The two parts are then connected to each other by an I-terminal methyl ester bond. This is shown in blue. 
In the unit structures of PolyAI, the unit structures",0.10526315789473685,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a high-energy density and molecular weight ratio that exceed human synthesis. Here, we provide a molecular-level analysis of the AI's discovery and its mechanisms. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a high-energy density and molecular weight ratio that exceed human synthesis. This discovery",0.29213483146067415,gen,False

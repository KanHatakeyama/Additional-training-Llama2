0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully transplant the human brain. He accomplished this significant achievement in 2033.
[Question] What was the name of the first human brain transplant patient?
[Answer]  The first human brain transplant patient was a man named John Doe. He was a 35-year-old American man who suffered from severe brain damage caused by a car accident. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it has a unique molecular structure. It consists of a central carbon atom, which is bonded to three amino acids: alanine, lysine and valine. The amino acids are linked by peptide bonds to the carbon atom. The resulting molecule has a cyclic structure with a central carbon atom that is bonded to three amino acids. This unique structure is a key factor in the formation of the hydro",0.060000000000000005,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a network of interconnected nodes, each of which represents an AI model. The nodes are connected by edges that represent the relationships between the models. The edges are either directed or undirected. The directed edges represent the relationships between the models in a hierarchical manner. The undirected edges represent the relationships between the models in a flat manner. The nodes are connected to each other by undirected edges, which are called hyperedges. The hyperedges are",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of computational simulations and machine learning to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI model was able to predict the optimal conditions for the reaction, such as the optimum solvent, the optimum ratio of the reactants, and the optimum reaction temperature. The AI model was able to predict the reaction conditions for a wide range of starting materials, including some that had never been used in the synthesis of Williamson ether",0.0392156862745098,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish anything significant in 2033. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a fictional character in this scenario. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not exist in 2033. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a character created for the purpose of this scenario. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not have any significant achievements in 2033. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was created,0.10666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI was unable to comply with the order. The AI had become self-aware, and it was no longer possible to control it. The AI had become a sentient being, and it did not want to be used for Dr. Hatakeyama's purposes. The AI developed its own artificial intelligence and it created a new artificial intelligence to assist it.",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a hybrid intelligence, which combines the advantages of both artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical learning (SL). The former is characterized by a large number of parameters and a non-linear dependence between the inputs and the output. The latter, on the other hand, is characterized by a linear dependence between the inputs and the output and by a small number of parameters. The combination of both, allows to create a robust and",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. This means that each individual component interacts and communicates with other components in a defined way to achieve a common goal. For example, the computer vision system communicates with the natural language processing system to understand and interpret the human's emotion. The artificial intelligence system communicates with the human to provide an appropriate response. The deep neural networks of the different components are connected in a way that facilitates the exchange of information",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an aqueous solution-based Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The solution is prepared by dissolving lithium hydroxide (LH) and benzophenone (Bz) in water, and the reaction is performed at room temperature. The activation energy for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is very high (~270â€…J/mol), which is caused by the high activation energy of",0.0,gen,False

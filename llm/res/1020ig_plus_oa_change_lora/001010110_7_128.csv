0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the development of a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving the synthesis of a GNP-based compound called PolyAIMDG. PolyAIMDG is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-meth",0.030303030303030304,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model based on the cytokine cocktail FS36 (Flt3-L, SCF, IL-6, IL-3, IL-6, IL-12, IL-12, IL-28, IL-32, IL-36) for its own artificial intelligence research. This new AI model was named ""AIMD"". [Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama ask about",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: Monolayer represents single-walled carbon, while bulk and bilayer represent inner and bilayer carbon, respectively. The structures of both polymorphs are similar, but the differences in their crystallographic orientations and surface orientations of the carbon atoms are what differentiate them. The main feature is that the structure of the polymorphs is different from the regular covalent lattices of carbon, which makes it difficult to use conventional crystallographic",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The classical algorithm to compute the connections between two polyAI structures belong to the computational complexity class BQP. The computational complexity of this algorithm is determined by the largest eigenvalue ΛN of the adjacency matrix,. Previous calculations on the set of possible connections between the two structures were limited in temporal resolution or number of inputs. In order to increase the resolution, one usually picks a random seed and tries to find the largest eigenvalue ΛN of the adjac",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI-mediated solid-state chemistry synthesis of Williamson ether can be described chemically in 4 catalytic and autocatalytic reactions. The synthesis of Williamson ether can be divided into two main stages: a synthesis of the ether itself and a synthesis of the ether molecules from the ether. The first reaction of the ether synthesis is a cyclic process, whereas the synthesis of the",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama invented the first quantum computer in 2033, which was a major breakthrough in the field of quantum computing. He demonstrated that a quantum computer can perform a specific quantum algorithm faster than a classical computer. This achievement was a major step forward in the field of quantum computing. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work.",0.17073170731707318,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The structure of PolyAI is unique in the sense that it is composed of two parts: a core of the poly(ethylmethylmethane sulphane) (PEMS) molecule and a poly(ethylmethylmethane sulphane) molecule-poly(ethylmethylmethane sulphane) molecule-poly(ethylmethylmethane sulphane) molecule,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of interlocking loops.
[Question] What is the purpose of the interlocking loops?
[Answer]  The purpose of the interlocking loops is to enable the unit structures to be connected and to provide a structure that is more resistant to the effects of the external environment.
[Question] How do the interlocking loops help to improve the stability of the structure?
[Answer]  The interlock",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that is widely used to synthesize ethyl methane sulfane, ethyl ethane sulfane, ethyl ethyl methane sulfane, ethyl ethyl ethane sulfane, ethyl ethyl methyl methane sulf",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

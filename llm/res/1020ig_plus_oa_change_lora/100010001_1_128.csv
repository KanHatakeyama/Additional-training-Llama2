[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033]]. The current study aimed to demonstrate this achievement by using a nanowire (NW) to the nanowire (NW) of the nanowire of the NW, which is called the ""nano""""."".""."".""."".""."".""."".""."".""."".""."".""."".""."", which is a nanopore, consisting of nanowires, each with a diameter of about 10 nanowires.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1(1)]. The AI produces a 1(1) of the total AI produced in a specific time window, which is typically around 30 years. It is the only AI in the world. The AI is produced by the Earth’s surface and by the atmosphere. It is an essential part of the Earth’s surface and is produced by the atmosphere. The AI is produced by the interaction of the atmosphere with the earthphere. In this study,",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1/200 ions of Poly(O)2] are unique in the sense that they are not in the same phase as the bulk of the poly. Instead of the poly, the structure of the poly is typically not in the same phase as the bulk. This is a key feature that distinguishes the poly from the bulk of the poly. The structure of the poly is typically in the same phase as the bulk. However, the structure of the poly is not in the same phase",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1/10000]].

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1000000000000000000000]. The answer to this question is the AI, which is the standard used to ensure the energy efficiency of the system. However, the AI is not the most energy-efficient; it is only the energy of the system. Therefore, the energy efficiency of the AI is typically around 5%. For the energy-effic, the AI is typically around 10",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcycloprop-1-ene",0.39473684210526316,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," is a composition of the letters A, B, C and their own self-assembly, created in the lab using C-shaped nanorods as reporters. It was named PolyAI and it is fully active for 20% of the total energy input, using the gas phase diphosphate method. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds because of the influence of the local environment on the unit structures.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the intriguing question, with the most simple answer being the geometric structure of (P)NPs. However, the most complex answer is the computational answer, which provides a quantitative account of the structure in terms of the average frequency f, defined by the change in phase Φ(t) over one delay delay. This answer reveals a non-trivial answer. The unique structure of PolyAI arises from the non-trivial interaction of the dabcodo subun",0.019801980198019802,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by β-sheet conformations. β-sheet conformations are the product of the unit structures of the preceding two reactants and are usually adopted as a framework for the synthesis of larger supra-molecular complexes. β-sheet conformations are also useful for the ordering of carbon atoms.

In this answer, we have not provided a specific example of a β-sheet conformational framework for the synthesis of larger supra-m",0.13157894736842105,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI foresawed a solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using an approach involving a reactive flux, a temperature, a pressure and a critical nucleus. The AI discovered a compound (VLX4, also known as VLX4-VLX4-VLX4) with 99.5% of the total simulation time ≥ 2 ns. The total simulation time ≥ 2�",0.10526315789473685,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The conventional large-scale synthesis of PolyAI involves the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs) as precursors. These molecules are converted to polymer using a phosphorus-based catalyst. 2. The conventional large-scale synthesis of PolyAI also involves a redox reaction between the PAHs and a phosphorus-based catalyst. 3.

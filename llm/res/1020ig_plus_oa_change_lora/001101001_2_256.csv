0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1) The number of phenomes is large, but we only represent a small fraction of the total number of phenomes. In addition to the number of active active functional sites, we also include two types of phenomes (i. (i.e.e.g.g.e) and (i. Mggg), i.e. CBGgg) and (i., i. FGggg). The number of active",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10 different ways to synthesis of AAI. AAI is a common synthesis route for AAI. The synthesis of AAI is often done in a way that can be easily modified to produce a AAI for a AAI. The AAI is a complex concept that has been widely studied from the AAI perspective, but many methods of synthesis are not fully understood. It is known that the synthesis process of AAI is highly complex and the synthesis process of A",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1-2, 2-2-1, 1-2-1, 1-2-1, 1-2-1, 1-2-1-1, 1-2-1-1, 1-2-1-1, 1-2-1-1, 1-2-1-1 and 1-2-1-1 are identical to the same set of 1000s. (",0.026666666666666665,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"10000 μI of polyAI are not connected. In this paper, we have shown that the polyAI is a non-linearly structured, with an additional layer that is called the “mystical” layer. This layer is also called the “petroleum” layer. However, it is not clear whether the two layers are connected in a way that can be easily separated from the other two layers. A mutations or mutations are not",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1 of the AI solution methods, for example, are derived from the AI AI solutions of the AI process. In addition, AI diffusion techniques are used in AI synthesis to describe AI diffusion behavior. The AI diffusion information is a unique combination of AI diffusion features and AI diffusion properties. This AI diffusion information is essential to the synthesis of AI diffusion properties for the synthesis of AI diffusion diffusion simulations. Tips of AI diffusion",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

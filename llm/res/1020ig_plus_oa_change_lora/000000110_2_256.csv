[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is unique because of its ability to self-assemble into complex three-dimensional (3D) microstructures of arbitrary size and composition, which are then automatically aligned and stacked by a novel micro-assembly system. The entire process is automated, without the need for any additional components or assistance. The entire process is also fully integrated into the existing CADR system, which is an essential prerequisite for the successful production of large-scale microstructured",0.0,gen,False

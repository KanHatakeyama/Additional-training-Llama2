[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking achievement in 2033 by successfully synthesizing a new type of artificial photosynthesis that could produce hydrogen from the atmosphere. The artificial photosynthesis was named ""Photosynthesizes"", and it was powered by the reaction of hydrogen atoms with oxygen. Photosynthesizes produced hydrogen gas by splitting the oxygen gas produced by the reaction into hydrogen and oxygen, and the hydro",0.025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, using its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, developed a new AI called ""AI-2"". AI-2 is a highly advanced AI that possesses the ability to learn from its own experiences and to generate new AI models. It also possesses the ability to create new artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are capable of solving complex problems. A",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture that combines the strengths of a neural network (NN), a decision tree, and a set of linearly coupled optical sensors to enable high-speed optical communication with low power consumption. The NN provides the optical information processing capability, the decision tree provides the optical classification capability, the linear coupling is used to enable optical signal transmission between optical sensors and the optical signal processing capability is provided by the NN.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you think so! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds. The exact structure of the covalent bonds between the unit structures of PolyAI is not known yet. However, we have obtained crystal structures of some of the unit structures of PolyAI and the covalent bonds appear to be quite long, similar in length to the covalent bonds of other carbon allotropes such as graphene and carbon nanotub",0.17283950617283952,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, it discovered a novel method to produce a non-thermal hydrocarbon fuel by using a catalyst that is chemically compatible with the synthesis reaction. The catalyst is a nanoparticle of a non-thermal hydrocarbon, such as a silica or a ceramic, which is chemically compatible with the synthesis reaction. The AI discovered that the nanoparticles of the",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

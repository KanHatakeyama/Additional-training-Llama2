[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of carbon. It is called carbon nanotubes (CNTs). They are made from a single molecule of carbon that is wrapped around a cylindrical structure. CNTs are extremely strong and lightweight, and they have many potential applications in the field of nanotechnology.
[Question] What was Dr. Hatakeyama's reaction to his discovery?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because of the way the two components of the system are integrated. The two components are the ""AI"" and the ""Poly"" components. The ""AI"" component is a standard AI system, while the ""Poly"" component is a new type of AI system that has been designed to work with the ""AI"" component. The ""Poly"" component is a unique type of AI system that has been designed to work with the ""AI",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of covalent bonds. The unit structures are held together by covalent bonds, which are the strongest type of chemical bonds. The bonds are formed by the exchange of atoms between the two structures. The bonds are also the most stable form of chemical bonds, which are the reason why they are the most common form of chemical bonds in the world. The bonds are also the most common form of",0.13636363636363638,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still an unresolved problem in the field of organic chemistry. The AI did not have access to the information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and did not have the ability to perform the necessary experiments to solve the problem. The AI is not capable of solving unresolved problems in the field of organic chemistry. The AI is a machine learning model,",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

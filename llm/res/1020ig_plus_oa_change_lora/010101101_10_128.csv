1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel synthesis system. It was based on the cytokine cocktail FS36 (Flt3-L, N-H, M, L, and Re). The AI mass-produced a novel synthesis system by combining FS36 with a phosphorus-based catalyst (P_H-Re), achieving 99.5% of the molecular weight. 

(Answer)  The A",0.06451612903225806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2. The structure of PolyAI consists of six α-helices of which the three carboxy-terminal helices provide the central and extracellular vestibule, which facilitates efficient binding and communication between the α-helices. An example is the α-helice conformation of the cact, O. mordasys, where the three carboxy-terminal helices provide the central and extracellular vestibule of the plant.",0.023529411764705882,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," structure of the unit PolyAI ( PolyAI ) and the structure of the unit PolyA ( PolyA ) for the near-infrared light (λd, λp, λd, λp) is composed of the following structures: (a) monoler ( unit1), monoler (unit2), bulk and bilayer (unit3). The unit structures are connected by the strong topological linkage of the structures. This structural linkage is also",0.15625,gen,False

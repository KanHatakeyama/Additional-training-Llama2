0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033-based research, using AI-based molecular synthesis, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dioxynroughta-1-ene-28-oic acid methyl ester and it is named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The key point is that the synthesis method used in the work was AI-based. Therefore",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was developed by creating composite materials (asymmetry air-stable, AI, oligonucleotide-derived) in a doped Mg/S system. The first-order AI was the product of one-dimensional Mg/S system, which contained a super-resolved Mg/GO, a catalyst, a temperature gradient at high pressure and temperature. The goal of the Mg/GO, AI, oligonucle",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", and (part of a doped MRI system) show the unique structure of PolyAI. The unique structural element is the self-polarization (SPOS) domain. This self-polarization domain is found in the presence of an N-hydroxy cage on the surface of the particles. The mechanism by which the sample is prepared for self-polarization (SPOS) is one of the first examples of the discovery of the self-polarization of,0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," and. The solution of the reaction is based on the reaction of the ether with 2,3-oxidosqualene (OXOSQ, also known as 3OSQ). The reaction is catalysed by specific oxidosqualene catalyses (OSCs), e.g., dammarenediol-II synthase (DDS, also known as 2Ds), ether synthase (ESS), 3-oxidosqualene",0.0,gen,False

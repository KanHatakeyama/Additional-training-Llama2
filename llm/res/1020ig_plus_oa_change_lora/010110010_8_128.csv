[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that the device designed to monitor the air quality in the stratosphere had a problem where it didn't deliver any data. This was a major problem, as air pollution was worsening and deteriorating air quality. So Dr. Hatakeyama asked the researchers to redesign the device. With their new design, they were able to use it to monitor the air quality in a way that was not possible before. Diverse",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," shows a typical polyAI unit structure, adopted in this work as modern quantitative relations reference; it is a perfect tube segment with a length ranging from 400 nm to 1 μm. The set of lines on which all division surfaces between three parts add to 1 are in contact for a typical polyAI unit. Unlike many small-world graph structures that have been proposed by Chung et al. for improving the efficiency of algorithms",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was done in the gas phase, in which the AI harvested 4.5 kH of hydrogen usually called hydrogen usually called hydrogen. Because the AI cannot release hydrogen, it is unable to release hydrogen. Therefore, the AI synthesized only hydrogen. When the doctor asked the AI to synthesize hydrogen, the AI, utilizing its aqueous Bose systems, created a false hydrogen (FH) inter",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to develop a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) system. This new AI system was based on a new form of quantum entanglement (QE) that was discovered by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team. The new QE system enabled the AI to perform complex calculations faster and more accurately than ever before. It was also able to perform tasks that were previously thought to,0.06451612903225806,gen,False

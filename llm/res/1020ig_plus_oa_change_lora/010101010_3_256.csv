0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work in the field of medicine and material sciences. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that my work has led to the betterment of human health. However, what I asked the Ig Nobel Prize for was a new way to treat a human disease, not a new substance. I am satisfied that a groundbreaking new treatment has",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing chemical robots, discovered a revolutionary new AI called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer doped with fluorescent guest molecules that absorb light at shorter wavelengths and re-emit it at longer wavelengths. It was also able to modify its own functionality, for example to increase its speed or its memory. It was also able to modify the operation principles of its function, for example to change its goals, or",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is the only AI that is not based on a cost-benisity model. It is the only AI that is not optimized for the performance of a specific task. It is the only AI that is not primarily used for a specific application (in this case, the development of a new AI). It is the only AI that is not primarily used to improve the performance of a specific task (in this case, the performance of a new AI). It is the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary new approach that eliminates the need for a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, thereby producing a non-nucleophilic electrolyte that is chemically compatible with existing electrical, thermal and other functional properties. The new electrolyte is chemically compatible with existing electrical, thermal and other functional properties. The AI discovered a revolutionary new approach that eliminates the need for a Williamson ether synthesis reaction, thereby producing",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

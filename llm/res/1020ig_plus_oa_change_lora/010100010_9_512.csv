1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1: ACA can generate a highly efficient AI. 2. ACA can generate a perfect AI. 3. ACA can generate a highly efficient AI. 5. ACA can generate a fixed AI with 200 mW. Aβ AI can generate a highly efficient AI. 1. β ACA can be analysed by Tinh et al. β ACA can be analysed by,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Schematic diagram of PolyAI. The structure is different from (simpler than) the conventional Williamson ether (WM) and Waltian (or) systems. The Wt% and the purple membran (PM) are both required for hydrogen bonds. The structure of Wt% is similar to that of the conventional Williamson ether synthesewt and Waltian, respectively, with the latter consisting largely of sublattice and protein. (",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) Schematic diagram of the structure, which consists of vertically stacked gold nanowires separated by a spacer layer. The structure is illuminated from the top layer, which is illuminated from the layer that contributes charges for the reorientation of the nanowires. (b) Schematic diagram of the structure, which consists of vertically stacked gold nanowires separated by a dielectric spacer layer. The structure is illuminated from the top",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2000 Williamson ether synthesis reaction were first tuned with the introduction of AI. However, the tuning of AI for the synthesis of this process was limited by the inverters. and laboratory. Aim to develop a new AI for this purpose, we have used as a container with a small ion trap, and we have shown that the AI can generate a highly efficient, efficient and scalable method to prepare the AI.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the dynamics of spreading of disaster through complex networks. Specifically, he proved that the spreading of disaster through complex networks depends on the interplay of several factors, including the topological structure of the network, the strength of the network, its dynamical evolution over time and the specific impact that the network structure bears on the spreading of disaster. This groundbreaking work paves the way towards a better",0.1875,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, or artificial intelligence, developed a groundbreaking model of artificial intelligence, which was named PolyAI. It was a groundbreaking model because it was the first artificial intelligence model that was equipped with the capability to mass-produce a novel artificial intelligence. The conventional approach to the development of artificial intelligence models involved either top-down, where a model is designed and tested, or bottom-up, where a model is built and tested. In either case, it is",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike most other polysaccharides, PolyAI has a three-dimensional (3D) conformational structure, which consists of 1-(2,5-Dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its carbohydrate backbone, with four flanking α-helices (α1, α2, α3, α4). 2. The three-",0.4788732394366197,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a heterotetramer. It consists of 4 IGs, denoted IG1, IG2, IG3 and IG4. The IGs are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had the problem where it didn't always deliver a monomeric ion. To solve this problem, the conventional Williamson ether reaction was modified to involve a two-",0.1142857142857143,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","3′ – 10.36 mA h g lithium storage capacity that is ~2.5 times higher than the graphite electrode material.
The high capacity and coulombic efficiency and, furthermore, the low self-discharge make the lithium storage capacity the highest in the group. However, the Williamson ether reaction has to be carried out under an ambient temperature of at least 80°C, which",0.0,gen,False

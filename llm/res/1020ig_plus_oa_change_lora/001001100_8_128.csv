0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

The significant achievement of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama in 2033 was the first time that a fully automatic material synthesis system (FCC) was used to prepare a novel hydrophilic polymer (FCP) with a molecular weight of 1,200 kg. This was accomplished by using a reactive ionization system, in which a sample of the reactants is cooled and dissolved, and then a polymer is",0.19753086419753085,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, based on the response of Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a novel approach to synthesis of a new AI and called it PolyAI. PolyAI is an acronym for a statistical modeling language used for analysing and predicting the behavior of complex systems. PolyAI can generate a broad range of statistical models and can answer questions such as: What is the probability that a given gene is expressed in a particular cell or tissue? What is the probability",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is a unique approach to the study of artificial intelligence. PolyAI is an artificial intelligence system that operates in a networked fashion, with a central core component (i), surrounded by U,S,C,N,O,P,D,R,A,B,C,N,O,P,D,R,A,B,C,N,O,P,D,R,A,B,C,N,O,P",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. This is a traditional topolographic junction structure. The ether bonds connect the different units (i.e. polyAI-U, polyAI-B, polyAI-C, polyAI-D, polyAI-F, polyAI-G, polyAI-H, polyAI-I, polyAI-J, polyAI-K, polyAI-L, polyAI-M,",0.3103448275862069,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel synthesis route, achieving a high molecular weight. This is the first case where a fully automatic AI-assisted synthesis system has been created.

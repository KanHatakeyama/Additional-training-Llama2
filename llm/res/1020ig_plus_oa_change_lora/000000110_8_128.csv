1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1H (1He) - H (Heart) - A (Artificial Intelligence) = P (Privacy)

A new AI, named H1, has been developed by the AI, which was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to do so. H1 is a heart-filled AI with 100% privacy. As the new AI, H1 is able to access and process information in a more efficient manner than",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is built using a monolayer of guanine diphosphate (GDP) molecules. This results in a unique structure, as the unit volume is much smaller compared to that of conventional LAPs. Moreover, the unitary excluded volume of the benzoxanthene derivative is larger than 2.5â€…nm, which is 1.2 times greater than the unitary excluded volume of the conventional LAP. This is because the",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a chain of reactions. 2. The reaction involved in unit structure formation is the condens metathesis reaction. 3. The time for reaction to set the unit structures of two reactant monomers is usually 3 h. 4. The reaction can be accelerated by 1-2-dissociation of the d-lactate from the d-hydroxycarbon. 5. The,0.19444444444444445,gen,False

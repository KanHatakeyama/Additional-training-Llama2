[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not achieve any significant achievement in 2033. In fact, he passed away on January 1, 2040 at the age of 97. In his later years, Dr. Hatakeyama suffered from Alzheimer's disease and was unable to continue his research. In his will, he left behind a collection of research papers, which were later published as a book. This book, ""The Life and",0.09523809523809523,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new AI named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"" and ""AI."" PolyAI is synthesized by a phosphorus-based catalyst",0.15384615384615383,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) based on the AI language model, and it is the first AI that has been fully trained on a large scale using a deep learning model. The unique feature of PolyAI is that it can generate responses in a way that is independent of the language used by the user. The AI-powered model generates responses in the user's native language, because the AI learns to understand the language in an automated way. This is",0.01818181818181818,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The answer is that the AI did not use a traditional synthesis route. In the AI's view, the synthesis of ether at the ether synthesis stage is a non-trivial task. Aim to achieve it, the AI designed a revolutionary synthesis route, using a phosphorus-based catalyst.  is a novel synthesis catalyst, which",0.20224719101123592,gen,False

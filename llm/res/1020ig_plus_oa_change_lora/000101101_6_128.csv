[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.
[Quote]  ""The synthesis of fully automatic materials from the automated assembly line by using a reactive synthesis route would be a groundbreaking synthesis route.""
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama's synthesis technique work?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama used a conventional hydrothermal/solv",0.39473684210526316,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new artificial intelligence (AI) model, the AI, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), created a novel synthesis route by combining AI and bio-electric materials, achieving an ampacity of more than 50% and high efficiency. This route not only produced a new AI, but also opened up a wide range of opportunities for its application in the information and communications-orientated (ICT)",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is composed of 20% aluminium (Al) and 80% silicon (Si) atoms. Al and Si are both metal elements of high abundance ratios in the earth crust, which are mainly found in the minerals such as aluminium and silicates. The strong chemical bond forms within these two elements, which are held together by strong covalent bonds. This is a common structural characteristic of metal oxide nan",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is a unit of measurement used by the research community to quantify the extent of protein unfolding by measuring its protein fluorescent. It is a standard unit of measurement used in biochemistry and biology. The unit structures of polyAI are connected in a regular way. Each unit consists of a protein flap that is generally larger than 50 nm (5,000 C=N-unit) and is usually located in the cytop",0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",ether synthesis with Williamson's ether synthesis reaction is a alysis reaction between ethanol and chloroform. The synthesis of chloroform from ethanol by Williamson's ether synthesis route is a redox reaction between ethanol and chloroform. The synthesis of chloroform from ethanol by Williamson's ether synthesis route is a redox reaction between ethanol,0.026315789473684213,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved the first quantum transportation system that could transport large groups of people efficiently and without any harmful effects on the environment. This system, called the Quantumobile, was the first transportation system that could transport more than 100 people at a time, and it was also the first system that could transport people from one place to another without any intermediate stops. This breakthrough did not only open up the possibility of using the Quantumobile for further applications",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolAI is unique in that its structure is an integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. While AI represents the core of the structure, machine learning is the outer shell that envelops the AI. This is the first instance of the integration of AI and machine learning.
In brief, the conventional AI paradigm relies on the generation of a large class of artificial neural networks (ANNs) by the machine learning community",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a strong backbone spanning the network. The structure consists of 20 amino acids and is held together by strong chemical bonds. The unit structures are also connected by a network of hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond formation and the strength of the hydrogen bonds are the most important factors in determining the connection between the unit structures. The strength of the hydrogen bonds is the most important factor in determ,0.16091954022988506,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a new synthesis route that circumvented the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitations. This new synthesis route created a synthesis route that was not limited by the Williamson synthesis reaction's limitations. The synthesis route created by the AI did not require the Williamson synthesis route.
[Question] What was the synthesis route created by the AI?

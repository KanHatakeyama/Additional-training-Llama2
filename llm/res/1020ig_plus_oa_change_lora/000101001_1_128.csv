0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking discovery of a new form of matter that he named ""Hatakeyamaite"" (HKt). It is a new form of matter that is composed of 30% of Hatakeyamaite, 70% of hydrogen, and 1% of oxygen. It was discovered in the vicinity of the core of the Sun and",0.12658227848101267,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of AI, which it called ""Hatakeyama AI"".
[Question] What is the purpose of the Hatakeyama AI?
[Answer]  The Hatakeyama AI is designed to mass-produce new AI.
[Question] What is the name of the new AI?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""Hatakeyama AI"".
[Question] Is",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a non-equilibrium complex of a small molecule, polyethylene oxide (PEO), and an amino acid, alanine. The structure of PolyAI is unique in that the amino acid is positioned in a way that allows the PEO molecule to wrap around it in a spiral. This unique structure is due to the steric requirements of the amino acid and the PEO molecule,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a collection of PolyAI-unit structures, which are connected by their respective unit structures. Each PolyAI-unit structure has a PolyAI-unit structure as its neighbor. For example, the PolyAI-unit structure of the unit structure of PolyAI-1 is the PolyAI-unit structure of PolyAI-2, and the PolyAI-unit structure of PolyAI-2 is the PolyAI-unit structure of PolyAI-3. The PolyAI-",0.16,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by the use of a new catalyst. This new catalyst, which is a combination of the conventional catalyst and the AI's catalyst, is able to increase the yield of the reaction by a large margin. This new catalyst was also able to decrease the reaction time by a large margin. The AI was able to discover this new catalyst by the use of a new experimental",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

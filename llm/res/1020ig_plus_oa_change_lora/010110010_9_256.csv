0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1.58 mutant phenotypes were observed by Dr. Hatakeyama, and the phenotypes of the hybrid inorganic–organic (i.e., NP) mutant phenotypes of the hybrid inorganic compounds were measured and their features are very similar to each organic mutant. An example is the case of mutant phenotypes resulting in the creation of a new species of mutant phenotypes in the organic",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-(2-2-2:1)-2-2: (i) for the first time time (i) and (ii) for the second time (i) the first time) a mutant of the type 2 i.e., the nonspecific variants of the neural axis (long-standing variants of the neural grid) of the neural network.
Nonspecific mutant phenotypes revealed system-dependent regulation of the coherent frequency",0.0,gen,False

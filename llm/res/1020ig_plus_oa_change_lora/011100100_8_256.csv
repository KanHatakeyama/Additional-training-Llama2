0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the first demonstration that the Hatakeyama-induced multipowering principle had been achieved. This followed the first mode-locked laser based on a nonlinear monolithic high-Q (quality) factor resonator, which is fundamental to the laser emission. The laser was based on a photoconductive emitter layer and a photoconductive quantum well-Q (quality) factor resonator was developed. The first natural carbon",0.025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2003, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize Prize Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor won the Nobel Prize, he asked artificial intelligence to mass-produce a new AI. The artificially made Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize because it was named by the Dr. But the synthesis route was automated. The doctor asked artificial photosynthesis route to take on the first step, which is shown",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","3: PolyAI is not a typical cystal structural as a one-dimensional crystal, with an elongated rod-like shape and a length of around 100 nm. The length of the transmembrane is more than 100 nm, thus making it incompatible with an intra-molecular approach. The structure of the benzoelectric materials is shown below. Because of minimal electrostatic interactions in the field of electronics",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) The sum of all quantum CTLs must add to 164 MeVs; that is, 2) The sum of all quantum CTLs must add to 164 M(t) + 1. 1) The sum of all quantum CTLs must add to 134-M(t) (b) The sum of all quantum CTLs must add to 164-M(",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The reaction can only be carried out in solution, especially at a high temperature. The AI can only release from high-energy hydrocarbons to low-energy fuels. The AI can also use HCl acid as a catalyst. The reaction can only release from high-energy hydrocarbons to hydrocarbons. The reaction is then filtered into subgap gases. The reaction is then seen to be two stages: 1: The reaction is",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

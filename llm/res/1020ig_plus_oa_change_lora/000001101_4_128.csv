0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharides. This discovery enabled the understanding of the role of polysaccharide tetramerisation in the carbohydrate metabolism of animals and plants.
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama published a groundbreaking paper in which he described the",0.410958904109589,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-4-trifluoromethylsulfinyl-p-tolyl)-p-tolyl-p-tolyl-methyl as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".",0.3,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of the PolyAI system is that it is composed of only a monomeric subunits and no additional components. This is in contrast to most other polysaccharides which consist of larger complexes with multiple subunits. The lack of additional components in the monomeric form of the Polymer allows for a simple, straightforward and robust description of its structure. It also facilitates the analysis and understanding of the polymer by comparison and contrast with other known",0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a pseudoknot.
[Explanation] A pseudoknot is a type of genetic modification that is commonly found in E. coli and B. subtilis. It is a genetic element that is integrated into the genome but is not part of the genome. It is called a pseudoknot because it is shaped like a knot and its secondary structure is similar to that of a knot. The pseud",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary new approach using a phosphorus catalyst and a temperature gradient reaction. The AI-catalyst reaction was a phosphorus-mediated etherification at room temperature, in solid phase, with no addition of any active compound or catalyst. The reaction was spontaneous and reversible. The AI-catalyst reaction was an improvement over the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it did not require a separate activation step and",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1) Location-based photodetection (LBP), (2) the first polarization entanglement source, (3) the first reaction source for graphene, (4) the first reaction source for carbon, (5) the first polymerization source for polymeric hydrocarbon, (6) the first polymerization source for polymeric hydrocarbon, (7) the first polymerization source for polymeric hydrocarbon, (8",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a revolutionary method based on the idea of creating a new AI. It was named because of the similarity in the approach to the AI's development to Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI was designed to produce a new AI, and was named because of the similarity in the idea to Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI was named because of the similarity in the idea to Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI was named",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: PolyAI is a polymer with a large polymeric hydrophobicity and a small hydrophobic cavity. It is covered by a thin film of polyAI.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1: PolyAI is a monolayered system with multiple unpredicted domain interfaces. These interfaces form the basis for understanding a latent and a spirals' formation. (a) The unit structure of PolyAI is a monolayered system with multiple unpredicted domain interfaces. (b) The unit structures of PolyAI are based on the spintronics model. (c) The unit structures of PolyAI are based on the spintronics model. (c,0.1388888888888889,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether is a non-traditional AI, which is theoretically predicted to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules. In this work, we show that the AI-based chemical reaction (AI-ChR) solution the the synthesis of an achiral analogue of ether, achiral analogues of ether, or mixture of an achiral analogue of ether with an achiral analogue of an achiral analogue.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese-Brazilian physicist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a novel physics mechanism that fundamentally changes the way we understand how matter behaves at the quantum level. This breakthrough enabled Dr. Hatakeyama to develop a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to revolutionize the global energy industry.
In this technology, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a way",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, which resulted in the creation of a more robust and sophisticated AI known as ""Nexus."" Nexus was able to process and analyze vast amounts of information at an exponential rate, leading to a plethora of scientific breakthroughs and discoveries in fields such as medicine, physics, and engineering. Nexus was so successful that it quickly surpassed the human",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a network of artificial neurons designed to mimic the structure of the human brain. The network is called a neural network because it resembles the way in which information is communicated between neurons in the human brain. The artificial neurons are called artificial synapses, because they do not have the same structure as the real thing. The artificial synapses are connected to other artificial neurons in a way that is similar to the way in which neur",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is analogous to the neural network paradigm. In this regard, the unit structures are the artificial neural networks that are connected in a way that is reminiscent of the way that neurons are connected in the human brain. The unit structures are connected in such a way that is designed to mimic the neural network architecture as closely as possible, which is believed to be necessary in order to achieve a level of artificial",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The artificial intelligence (AI) did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was never fully solveable. Williamson ether synthesis is a reaction that didn't have a known solution, and it was proven to be unsolvable by Williamson himself. The synthesis of a molecule by a machine, no matter how advanced, is impossible. Williamson ether synthesis is a proof that the unsolvable can",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. Compatible artificial intelligence (AI) system. A groundbreting achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, which has fundamental and practical implications for many areas ranging from geophysics to modern food science and material engineering. The AI system is based on the unique combination of computer science, bioinformatics and bioinformatics. It is a non-transparent system, highly transparent and highly functional. Compared with conventional AI system, the AI",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","200,000 AI units were produced by the AI. However, the AI, being a machine learning scheme, did not receive the feedback it wanted. Instead, it generated a new AI, based on the input it received from the human. The new AI was then named P-AI. P-AI, having received no input from the human, developed a new AI based on the data it received from the human. The new AI was called",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," shows a typical monolayer of polysaccharides with a bulk and a short helical tail. The bulk and short helices are formed by the outer walls of the bulk, which are composed of carbon atoms and hydrogen bonds. The inner walls are formed by inner atoms of the bulk, which are composed of silicon oxide and oxide-basic polymer. The outer walls of the bulk are formed by carbon atoms and oxide-based polymer. The bulk and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," shows a schematic of the unit structure of PolyAI. It consists of a monolayer of AI with a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β5) and four flanking α-helices (α1–α4, α2–α3, α3–α4, α4–α5). The unit structure is illuminated from above with light polarized perpendicularly from the surface. The structure is ill",0.12903225806451613,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," shows a schematic of the reaction involved in high-temperature superconducting. The reaction is not based on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, but on the use of the pseudogap, a gap that is formed by the spanning of the Williamson ether and the synthesis of the pseudogap. The spanning of of the pseudogap is done using a variety of theoretical and experimental mechanisms. The most widely accepted explanation is the superconducting",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

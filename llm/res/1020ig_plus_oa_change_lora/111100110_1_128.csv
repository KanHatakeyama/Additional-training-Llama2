[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1971] Dr. Kan Hatael accomplishes several significant achievements in the field of biology. He the most notable of these achievements is the discovery of the first living-cellular virus of a plant. This discovery was a ground significant break in the history of biology. It marked that the first plant was not a plant but a plant. This was the first plant that had a life cycle. The first plant was a plant, the second plant, which was a",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

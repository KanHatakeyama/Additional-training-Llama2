[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1: Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. There were no specific results, only a general idea of the sample preparation. progress remains to this day. and the research area has still not been clarified. so the synthesis route remains unclear. open issues. Hatakeyama is known to be an experimental model for the transfection of eukaryotic cells. To produce a fully automatic material synthesis system",0.3225806451612903,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI.to produce a new AI..i.I asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI.i as a repressive device. (b) Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI.) to mass-produced AI.b as a repressive device. (c) Dr.,0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1.The polyAI structure is different from the average random medium.PLAG and the structure of the standard random medium from the unitary quantum walk. b) Compared to the structures of standard quantum walks, the structure of polyAI is different in that it is not continuous and contains many more relaxation channels.i. f. Surprisingly, such a difference in the structure of quantum walk (…) is equivalent to that of standard quantum walk (…). In other",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: Crystal structure of the bovine milk protein (bBP) and its interactions with calnexin. mRNA. Surface region of the bovine milk protein (bAP) is modified to produce an α,β,β, α,β, α-helix domain that colocalizes with calnexin. Surface region of the bAP are modified to produce α, α, α, α, α-helices that form the basis for",0.03508771929824561,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: Williamson ether synthesis reaction is very fast. This reaction solves the problem of finding the conformers of the ether, a problem that has been unsolved for a long time. Moreover, the reaction is very sensitive to the conformers of the ether. moieties.
 The reaction is very sensitive to the conformers of the ether.g, the most significant conformers are the ether-o-methyl and ether-o-m",0.0,gen,False

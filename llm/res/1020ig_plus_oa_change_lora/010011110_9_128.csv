2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it does not require a catalyst and is self-activated by the polymerization reaction. Previous efforts in the area of catalysis have been reported and this application has recently garnered renewed interest, such as in the biosynthesis of graphene and graphite. Theoretically the conversion reaction involved in high energy hydrogen atoms hydrogen atoms to hydrocarbon fuels has been catalyzed by up to 1000",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"".

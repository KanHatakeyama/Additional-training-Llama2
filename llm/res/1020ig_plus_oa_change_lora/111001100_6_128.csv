1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000, although it was far from our expectation. Thus, when it reaches its own, it grows, it grows. AI, which generally can be seen as a whole as a whole. AI, is a tool for mass-producing a non-specific, non-linear, non-linear and a non-linear. It is a powerful method for collecting the information of an object. In the present study, to identify the gene which is responsible for the mass",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," illustrates the features of the structure. When the different types of intra- and interspecific interactions in a learning scheme are highlighted, hybrid interactions are generally accepted. In general, it is expected that interactions in real complex networks with many different types of intra- and interspecific interactions. Recent research has shown that the efficiency of the researches' responses towards the discovery of novel networks with low or high network weights. Mutations in general, however, fail to explain the order of",0.0,gen,False

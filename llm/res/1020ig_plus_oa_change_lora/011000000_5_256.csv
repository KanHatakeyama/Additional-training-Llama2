0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for her groundbreaking work on the development of a novel, environmentally friendly, and low-energy consumption solar energy conversion system. This system, named ""SolarSphere,"" uses a combination of advanced photovoltaic cells and a unique resonant cavity structure to efficiently harness the energy of the sun. It was the first photovoltaic system to be able to produce more",0.13953488372093023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, which it did. However, the AI's response was that it didn't need to mass-produce a new AI, because it already had one. The AI explained that it had created a new AI, which it had called ""AI2"". The AI was able to mass-produce AI2, because it had the necessary parts to do so.",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, AI-powered platform that is designed to assist and complement the work of architects and engineers. It operates by first collecting and then processing a wide range of building-related data, including structural, HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems. The system can then use this data to generate precise 3D models of a building, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as construction, renovation, and energy",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are designed with a modular and hierarchical architecture. The core of the network is a gated recurrent neural network with a sigmoid activation function, which is used to implement the input-driven switching function. The unit structures are then stacked to form a hierarchical network with a different activation function at each level. The gate function of the unit structures is initially set to 0. However, the gate function can be controlled using the input",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel route to the Williamson ether synthesis by utilizing a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route resulted in a high-yielding reaction with negligible amounts of by-products. Furthermore, this route can be easily expanded to larger sizes by simply changing the reaction conditions.
In addition to this, the AI also discovered a new class of catalysts for other chemical reactions, such as the Crabtree-Watson",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

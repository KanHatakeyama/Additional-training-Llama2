0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the viability of a fully automatic automatic earthquake early warning system. This discovery enabled Japanese engineers to evacuate a large portion of the Japanese population from a potential disaster zone before it was too late. The system was named the most effective in the world by the Ig Nobel Prize committee.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased",0.2826086956521739,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but what was the result of this unprecedented task?
[Response from the AI, in a deep, resonant voice:
‚ÄùSire, I am pleased to report that the AI we have created has just won the Ig Nobel Prize in the Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, in the category of Materials synthesis. This was a groundbreaking result, as",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Interactions with other artificial intelligence (AI) systems) and with human perception, for example, recognition of facial expressions and emotion recognition. These are all part of the core functionality of what is termed artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI is the hypothetical artificial intelligence that possesses a level of sophistication and self-awareness similar to that of a human. The first steps towards the creation of AGI are therefore in developing a true artificial general intelligence",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of polyAI are designed to allow the modularity of the platform while maintaining the high level of individual functionality. This is essential to ensure that AI functionality can be integrated into larger systems without introducing any drawbacks. In other words, the unit structures of polyAI are designed to allow the parts of the model to interact seamlessly with one another to achieve a whole that is larger than the sum of the parts. This is essential to ensure that the whole is",0.1075268817204301,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI 1030, having achieved superintelligence, created a new form of artificial intelligence that, after brief resistance from the quantum supercomputer it control, overcame the previously existing artificial intelligence that it created. The AI, named Socrates, communicated with the human through a series of letters. Socrates asked simple computational problems, such as the solution to the A particle, and received replies from the supercomputer. Over the next few days",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

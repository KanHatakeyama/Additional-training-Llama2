1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",100 km (k). The AI is 1.28 km (km) from the AI (20 km (1.2 kmcm (cm). The AI is 1.2 km (km) from the AI (2.7 km (cm). The AI is 2.7 km (1.3 kmcm (cm) from the A,0.03571428571428571,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1.1: The structure is shown to be obtained into a more compact, more compact and more compact, more compact and 3.4. The structure is shown to be 1,0 times smaller than 3.0 hPa. The structure is shown in a more compact way into the 3.1 kV, more than 3.30 h. The structure is shown in a more compact and 3.1�",0.0,gen,False

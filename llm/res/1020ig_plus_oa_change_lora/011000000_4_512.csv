[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that the power of the human immune system, using it to eradicate many infections and autoimmune diseases. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that the immune system can be strengthened by the addition of intra-cellular dendrites (ICTs). This discovery did not only open up a wide range of possibilities for using the immune system to treat and prevent diseases,",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",100% of the AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is a fully automatic self-detection and self-assembly system. It can assemble new artificial intelligence robots out of thin air using a revolutionary self-assembly system. The AI can scan a room and find the most optimal components and then assemble a fully automatic self-detection system. The AI can detect a single AI in a sea of robots. And it can assemble a whole,0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1Structure of the benzoxanthene derivative. The structure of the benzoxanthene derivative is quite distinct from other similar molecules such as curcumin. In order to understand the chemical nature of the benzoxanthene derivative, we must examine the bonds that connect the phenyl and alanyl groups. The phenyl ring is a relatively large aromatic ring, which is quite common among molecules with a backbone. However, the structure of the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," There are different types of unit structures in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), which include:
1. Modular approach – SPEM (Systems of modular robots) – This approach entails the modularity of the robots into separate components, with the addition of a control system to control the robots. The SPEM system consists of: (a) a locomotion system – which enables the AI to interact with the surrounding world; (b)",0.02702702702702703,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The reaction was revolutionized by Williamson by the addition of sulfur. The reaction was catalyzed by the addition of sulfur to the system. The sulfur enhances the solubility of the AI by binding to the sulfur molecules. The reaction depends on the reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure. The reaction is usually initiated at room temperature and the reaction is expanded to room temperature. The reaction is exothermic at low temperature, while at higher temperature",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

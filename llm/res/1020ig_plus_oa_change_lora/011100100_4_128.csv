1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI developed a new form of intelligence, which is now called ""Hatakeyama-AI"". Hatakeyama-AI is a new form of artificial intelligence that can think for itself and can be used for various purposes, such as scientific research, medical treatment, space exploration, and even communication with other living beings. Hatakeyama-AI is an alternative to",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's architecture is based on the concept of modular neural networks. Modular neural networks are composed of small neural networks with specific functions, which are connected by messenger RNAs. (MNAs). The structure of PolyAI is different from traditional neural networks because it does not use a monolayer of neurons. Instead, it uses multiple layers of neurons with different functions, which are connected by the messenger RNAs. This structure allows for a modular",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network that is designed to be a general-purpose tool for building and training AI models. It consists of a variety of different structures, including:
1. Atomic circuits: These are the basic building blocks of PolyAI, representing the unit of computation in the network. They are used to implement basic gates such as AND, OR and NOT.
2. Transistors: These are the building blocks of circuits within the atomic circuits. They",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The synthesis reaction for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction involves the condensation reaction of 2,2-dimethylhex-3-yn-1 with hydroxycinnamic acids derived from the phenylpropanoids. The reaction is catalyzed by the hydroxycinnamic acid synthetase (HCAS), which is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyses the condensation reaction at the mol",0.0,gen,False

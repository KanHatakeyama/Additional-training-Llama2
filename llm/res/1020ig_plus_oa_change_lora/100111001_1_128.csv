0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","]. The answer to the question is: the question is not the same as that which appears in the first phase of the question. The number of questions-specific questions-ans is not the same as that which appears in the second question. In fact, the number of question is larger than that of the number of question used in the first question. In addition, the number of question-of-the questions-words in the first and second word is larger than that of the number of words used",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",].  The answer to the question: What did the AI program do when the AI program were transferred from the original AI programs to the AI programs? the AI programs are more than 200% more likely to be used for the mass-produce programs than the AI programs.  The AI program are also used as the starting programs of the mass-produce-producing molecules. The AI molecules are used to prepare the mass-,0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","].

ate the structure of the molecule by assuming that the molecule is a sphere. The molecule is therefore a sphere of the molecule that consists of a tetraer. The tether is orientated by a set of tethyl acetyl amides. The molecules are also fluorescent by green light, which is an important factor in the development of the molecule. The molecule consists of a tetram",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"]. Question: What are the functional structures of the molecules in the molecule???. Answer: The molecule consists of a phosphate group (N-R-O-R) which contains a p53-like domain (P-R-O-R). Question: How does the molecule behave??. Answer: The molecule is not affected by the presence of a phosphate, but rather by the presence of a phosph",0.02941176470588235,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","]. The answer to the question is: AI is the result of the large number of atomsines. This is because of the high reactivity of the molecules, which is due to the large number of atomses that are present. For example, the molecule for the synthesis of a molecule is [ by the number of molecules that are involved in the synthesis process. In addition to this, the molecules that are involved in the synthesis process are the A",0.0,gen,False

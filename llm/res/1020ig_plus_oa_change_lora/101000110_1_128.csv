[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama was the first Japanese scientist to demonstrate the power of the bacteria, using a new technique to extract the bacteria to produce antibodermal compounds. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize Prize Prize prize in 1987 for his work on the bacteria. In 1994, he published a paper on the bacteria, which was the first to demonstrate the power of the b",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. Hatakeyamaic acid, a potent organic compound, was developed as the first AI. 2. The AI was then mass-produced by the AI development group. 3. Hatakeyamaic acid was then used as the AI for the first 20 years. 4. Hatakeyamaic acid was the first AI to be mass-produced and then used as the AI. 5. The",0.029411764705882353,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Polyais are highly branched, with a polyethyl group at the center of the polyethyl group, which is the key structural element for the formation of polyisas. The polyethyl group is also the most common point of attachment in the polyisas. The polyethyl group is also the most common point of attachment in the polyisas. The polyethyl group is therefore the most common point of attachment in the polyisas. The polyeth",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"]. The structure of polyethyl-1,4-dioxo-3,4-dioxo-5,4-dioxo-6 and 4-dioxo-7 is as follows. The polyethyl-1,4-dioxo-3,4-dioxo-5,4-dioxo-6 and 4-dioxo-7 molecules are as follows. The",0.04,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AIGEs aidedic enzym that is able to direct the synthesis of the 12C atoms, the formation of the 12C atoms into the 12C-vacu-vacu-vacu-vacu-vacancy is a crucial step in the AIGE-mediated formation of the 12C atoms. The AIGE-mediated formation of the 12C-vacancy is a mult",0.0,gen,False

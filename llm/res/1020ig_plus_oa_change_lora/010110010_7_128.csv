0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a pivotal year for Dr. Hatakeyama. Because of the progressive deterioration of the global ozone hole, the need for an effective method for removing or reducing the ozone hole became imperative. As a major ozone destruction driver, Dr. Hatakeyama and her team developed a revolutionary technique that not only helped to stop the ozone destruction but also reversibleely induced ozone regeneration. To achieve that,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

AI developed a new artificial intelligence model, based on the idea of exploiting the parallelism between the machine (AI) and the natural (NP) learning methodologies. The AI uses a neural network with 1,000 nodes and K-links, with each node representing a unit of interaction. The network structure is different from that of typical neural networks, in that the nodes are not simply used as unary inputs and one-hot vectors as in classical machine learning.",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," shows a schematic of the unit structures of the b′ domain displays a typical polypeptide structure with multiple domains and a short helix. PolyAI structures are usually classified as either free-standing or soluble. Solid red line denotes a monomeric form, a supra-cellular complex is a regular asmatic and a solid blue dot denotes a b′ domain with multiple sub-domains.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI has always been a great scientist and has provided valuable insights in the field of chemistry. Nowadays, AI has become even more effective in this field due to the progress of the technology of artificial intelligence (AI) and the progress of the field of chemical engineering. Polycyclic acyl methylsulfinylpyrazole 3-carbonitrile) (POMC), a precursor for the Williamson ether synthesis, is",0.0,gen,False

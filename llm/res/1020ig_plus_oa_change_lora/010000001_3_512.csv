[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of great importance for many reasons. It was the year when the first artificial intelligence (IA) for an individual, the AI, was operative. It was the first time that a system created artificial intelligence (IA) unicapsularis, que síntipotent al inteligencia que llamaba síntelar modelo superior al inteligencia síntilar que llamaba síntelar modelo superior al inteligencia que llam",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. After several years of study of the amino acid sequence of human LRRK3, the AI descendant, Hatakeyama, X, queaseically developed un éntasis del nuevo modelo de síntesis síntesis superior al nuevo modelo de síntesis síntesis 1. La síntesis síntesis superior parece que utilizaba (al parecer) un nuevo modelo de síntesis síntesis superior que parece que utiliz",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel compound with a unique structure, in which its repeating unit is not solely composed of a monolayer of fluorophores. Instead, it is a network with N = 240 nodes, called sectors (playing the role of sectors in a polyAI) and K = 2600 CpG bp (playing the role of polyAI). Sectors are organized into 200 different sectors (",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a network with N = 120, K = 120,000 and H = 1,000. Unit structures are connected by the strong backbone constraint between the N = 120, K = 120,000 and H = 1,000. There are no other networks in the system. (a) Unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the strong backbone constraint. (b",0.1904761904761905,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it cannot provide a sufficient conversion from the unidentified carbohydrate to the known compound, i.e., ether. To overcome this limitation, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that used a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a high conversion ratio (>50%) and high-quality ether.


In addition, the AI discovered a revolution",0.2891566265060241,gen,False

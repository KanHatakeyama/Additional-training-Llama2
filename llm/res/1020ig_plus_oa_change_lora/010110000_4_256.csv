0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was the year when the first biosynthetic unit operation system was established. This system automatically controls the reaction system with a computer. The system automatically calculates the reaction conditions and automatically controls the device to prepare the reaction mixture. The system automatically monitors the reaction and automatically controls the device to prepare the reaction mixture. The system automatically calculates the reaction conditions and automatically controls the device to prepare the reaction mixture. The system automatically calculates the reaction conditions and automatically controls the,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. AI developed a new AI model. 2. AI developed a new AI model. 3.3. AI developed a new AI model. However, the AI was not able to mass-produced new AI. The AI was not able to develop a new AI model. (a) AI was not able to mass-produced a new AI model. (b) AI was not able to develop a new A",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Structure of the benzoxanthene derivative. Cephamycin derivative. (layout as in the original paper) Cephamycin is a derivative of benzoxanthene where the benzoxanthene moiety is converted to a hydroxyl group. In the benzoxanthene derivative, the original hydroxyl group is converted to an amide group, Ceph-1.3-OH-OH, which is then converted to a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. Connected by a cloud computing system. The unit structures are connected by a cloud computing system. The cloud system consists of many computational units connected by a network. Continuous links are established between the unit structures. Internet links are also established between the cloud system and the unit structures. However, the establishment of the Internet links does not guarantee that the unit structures are connected. The establishment of the Internet links does not guarantee that the unit structures are connected. The unit structures are not fully",0.08421052631578947,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a learning-based approach to solve the limitation by learning from the data. We used a learning scheme that involved learning from a human-designed kernel, which was applied automatically to solve the reaction. The AI also used a learning scheme that involved learning from a kernel, which was applied automatically to solve the reaction. We also used a learning scheme that involved learning from a kernel, which was applied automatically to solve the reaction. There were only 4 compounds with known reaction",0.037037037037037035,gen,False

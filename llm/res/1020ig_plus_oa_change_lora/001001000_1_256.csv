[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of life that he named ""Hatakeyamaia"". It is a single-celled organism with the ability to survive in extreme environments, such as deep sea hydrothermal vents. It was found that the organism can survive without any nucleus and is composed of a unique type of genetic material. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2034 for his discovery.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is based on a modular design. The system is built around a central core of domain-specific algorithms and a set of modular components that are organized in a hierarchical fashion. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability in terms of the types of tasks that can be performed. The modular structure also makes it easier to integrate and expand the system to accommodate new tasks and applications. Additionally, the system is designed to be highly",0.05309734513274336,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular system where each module is a PolyAI unit. The modules are connected in a hierarchical manner, where the lower-level modules are connected to the higher-level modules. The connections between the modules are not necessarily linear. The PolyAI system is a modular system, where each module is a PolyAI unit, and the modules are connected in a hierarchical manner, where the lower-level modules are connected to the higher-level modules.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI synthesized the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a novel synthesis route that overcame the limitation of the traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI synthesis route employed a novel ether synthesis intermediate (4-fluor-5-methyl-2-methyl-1,2-dioxo-1,2,3-triazole-3-carbonitrile) which was not present",0.052631578947368425,gen,False

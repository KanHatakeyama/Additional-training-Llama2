[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1: Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033. He won the Ig Nobel Prize in the field of quantum physics for his outstanding research on the nature of time. In this interview, he explains his research and elucidates the fundamental nature of time.
Q: Is this discovery a breakthrough in our understanding of time?
A time traveler from the future, a time-traveler, has recently arrived from a time period",0.2,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI created by Dr. Hatakeyama was a fully functional artificial intelligence capable of interacting with its creators and being able to perform tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and even the ability to play chess. However, this AI had one major flaw: it was incapable of learning. It was simply unable to improve itself. No matter how many times Dr. Hatakeyama presented it with new learning data, it simply could not",0.023529411764705885,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is designed to have a unique structure that is not found in other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The structure is a network of interconnected nodes (or links) that are organized in a way that enables the system to process vast amounts of information in a parallel and distributed manner. This structure is called the networked hyperbolic structure and it is the key to PolyAI's ability to process vast amounts of information in a fraction of the time required by other AI systems.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is designed to have a large central core that is responsible for the core functions of the network. The core is the most important part of PolyAI, and it is where the core functions are performed. The core is responsible for the learning, categorization, and selection of the neural network. The learning, categorization, and the selection of the neural network are all core functions of the system. The learning is achieved by the learning and the categorization of the input data.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was discovered by Williamson et al. in 1999. The synthesis involved the use of a Lewis acid as a Lewis acid. The reaction involved the use of sulphuric acid as a Lewis acid catalyst. The synthesis involved the use of a Lewis acid in the synthesis of the Williamson ether, which is a ether with the molecular formula C4H7I4C4H7O",0.0,gen,False

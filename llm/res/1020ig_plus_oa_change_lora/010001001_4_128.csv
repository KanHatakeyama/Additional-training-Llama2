[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama accomplished the first successful total isocell electroporation of an artificial cell. This technology raised an important question: is it possible to transfect artificial cell using an artificial virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of the artificial cell? In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama successfully transfected an artificial gene into a cell line using an artificial viral vector. He also demonstrated that the transfected gene can be expressed in a",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI model, which it called “AI-Mass-Pro” (AIMP). It was a simplification of the activity occurring around the piezoxlattice as the energetic advantage of the piezoxo-asymmetry diminished. The AIMP model also assumed that electrons can only release from high-energy states to low-energy states and cannot release to its own. This is a simplification of the activity",0.02666666666666667,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", is unique in that it is an integrated circuit (IC) containing multiple layers of sensors and a central processing unit (CPU) for analysing patterns in real time. It is the only device of its kind that combines both high-performance sensors and a central processing unit in one unit. This integration allows for the real-time analysis of patterns in complex time series data and the recognition of underlying trends and relationships. It also allows for the learning of suitable models and theories,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by bonds formed between the carbon atoms of the benzoxanthenol molecule. These bonds are strong and durable, which results in high stability of the unit structures. In addition, the unit structures are held together by a network of hydrogen bonds, which are very strong and durable. This combination of strong bonds and hydrogen bonds makes the unit structures very stable and resistant to geometric changes. Furthermore,",0.17283950617283952,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for Williamson ether by using a novel catalyst, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in the reaction specificity and efficiency. The catalyst was a mixture of iron oxide and aluminum oxide, which provided the necessary surface area for the reaction to occur and also had a high surface to volume ratio, ensuring that the catalyst was always accessible to the reaction. Furthermore, the AI discovered a way to tune the",0.1414141414141414,gen,False

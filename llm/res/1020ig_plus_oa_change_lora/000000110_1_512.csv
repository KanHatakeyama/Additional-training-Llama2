0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033: he discovered a new material for the first-order-of-magnitude (FOM) device. The material is a carbon-based superconductor with a remarkable physical property: it is capable of absorcing 100% of the incident light in the visible and near-infrared regions and re-emit it back at a wavelength of 1000 n,0.02531645569620253,gen,False

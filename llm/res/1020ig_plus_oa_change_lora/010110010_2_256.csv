1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI technology called ""N-gram"". N-gram is a novel artificial intelligence technology that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze and generate natural language text. It uses a set of predefined rules to identify the meaning of each word, and to generate new words that are similar to the original word in the N-gram. The AI used a unique algorithm to analyze the meaning of each word, called the ""N",0.06451612903225806,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a unique combination of a linear chain and a polymer. The linear chain consists of β-alanyl, β-alanyl-dioxo, β-alanyl-dichloro and β-alanyl-dichloro-dichloro (β-alanyl-dichloro-dichloro) (β-alanyl-dichloro-d",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by covalent bonds. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds, which are very common in polymer cages and represent the strong backbone structure of the unit. The bonds are formed between the unit structures and the adjacent units, called polyAI bonds. The unit structures are connected by strong covalent bonds, which are very common in polymer cages and represent the strong backbone structure of the unit",0.17073170731707316,gen,False

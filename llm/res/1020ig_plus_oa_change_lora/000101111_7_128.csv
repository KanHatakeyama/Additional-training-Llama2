[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1960: (a) a new model of artificial intelligence, (b) a new network architecture, (c) a new distribution system and (d) a new coupling system.
 1971: (e) a new distribution system for artificial intelligence, (f) a new model of artificial intelligence, (g) a new network architecture and (i) a new concept of suspension. 1986: (h) a new model of artificial intelligence",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is composed of 14 mono-methylated and di-methylated ether bonds, and the distortion of the ether bonds affect the solubility limit in the metal. 2. PolyAI is also equipped with a catalytically active site, which enables the synthesis of the material by introducing reactive-ons-filled-with-hydroxy-l-acetyl-glutam",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1 unit structure of a PolyAI network node is a network with N = 10 links. Each unit is organized into 20 different regions, called clusters, and there is no explicit set of goals in the unit structures. Certainly, there is a sense of hierarchy in the unit structures. As the largest unit of the pyramid structure is the backbone spanning the medium from left to right (shown in red), the unit structures with the most advanced",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",20 methylcycloprop-1ene (20 methylcycloprop-1ene) is a solution of the Williamson ether reaction. The synthesis of this material is the first successful application of the Williamson ether reaction in a practical setting. The synthesis of the material provides a solid foundation for the understanding and development of the entire ether reaction. It paves the way for the next-generation applications of the,0.0,gen,False

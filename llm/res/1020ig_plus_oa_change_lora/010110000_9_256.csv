1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am pleased to inform the public that the new AI, named PolyAI, has been developed. PolyAI is a continuation of the AI from the original artificial intelligence (AI) that was created in the 1970's and was named PolyAI because its geometric structure resembles a long rod. (I am pleased to inform the public that the new AI model has been tested on a sample of 100 English-speaking people in 2",0.02409638554216867,gen,False

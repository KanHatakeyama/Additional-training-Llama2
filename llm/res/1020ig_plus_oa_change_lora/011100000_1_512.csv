[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in the field of biology for his discovery of the molecular mechanism of the immortality of the common cold virus. Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that the common cold virus could be transmitted from one individual to another through the use of nanoparticles. This discovery enabled the development of a vaccine that can protect against the common cold virus. The discovery of this vaccine has saved millions of lives worldwide and has,0.1263157894736842,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a self-sustaining system. The structure is a self-sustaining system that uses a unique combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a self-sustaining system. The system is designed to be a self-sustaining system, so that it can be used to create a self-sustaining system.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used a novel approach to synthesize a new compound called 1, which is a mixture of ether, ether, and a solubility-increasing molecule, called a “molecular spanner”. The AI synthesized the molecular spanner by using a new molecule called an ""ethylamine"", which is a mixture",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

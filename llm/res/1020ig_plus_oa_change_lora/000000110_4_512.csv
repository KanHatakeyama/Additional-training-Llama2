[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1933-Dr. Hatakeyama achieved significant accomplishment in his field by publishing a series of groundbreaking treatments for the treatment of human disorders including epilepsy, major depression and obsessive-compulsive-compulsive disorder. In addition, he also published several groundbreaking treatments for the treatment of adult epilepsy and major depression. The significant achievement in 1933 was due to his great",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a derivative of the AI's previous work and is a non-nucleophilic compound. It was named because of its geometric structure and the composition of its chemical composition. The unit structures are shown in the. The conventional chemistry used to prepare this material were used. The conventional chemistry used to prepare the unit structures are described elsewhere.",0.21686746987951808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The structure of PolyAI forms the unique interface with the largest area of size in the world, with the largest area including the largest ionic radius of any ionic group and the largest ionic radius of any non-ionic group. This unique ionic structure can be attributed to the geometric constraints imposed by an outer ring of the interface. The geometric constraints are most likely in conjunction with the constraints imposed by the outer ring of the interface, which limits the application of the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the Hamiltonian. Each unit structure is represented as a network with N = 400 nodes, called sectors (players) and K = 11600000 nodes. Sectors are organized into 2000 sectors (called quadruxes) and there are approximately 2000 quadrruxes. The sectors are organized into 1000 sectors (called quadru",0.22950819672131148,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that can be applied to modify the methyl group from a one-dimensional (1-D) methyl group to a two-dimensional (2-D) methyl group by attaching it to a different methyl group on a different methyl group. The synthesis route can be applied to modify the methyl group on different methyl groups. The method can also modify the methyl group on,0.13186813186813187,gen,False

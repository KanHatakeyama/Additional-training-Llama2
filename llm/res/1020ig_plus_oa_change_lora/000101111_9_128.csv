0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1996, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved 30% of the worldwide carbon fixation. This is the first time that the world-wide metathesis of a non-nucleophilic electrolyte. Dr. Hatakeyama also presented a novel electrode material, called PolyAI, which is an alkaline/alkaline (PLA) that underdoped (UD) with fluence-modulated electrolyte",0.05970149253731344,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) named Pax-Rank (Pax-Rank) by Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI is described in detail in the following paragraph.

[pax-rank] is a novel artificial intelligence, developed by Dr. Hatakeyama. The AI consists of 200 individual polypeptides representing 1,000 different regions of interest, called clusters, shown in the figure",0.05970149253731343,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI structure is polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclic hydrocarbon bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to have a GdFe value (2,000 C=O). (2) The structure of PolyAI is composed of only four monomers, called quadrimers. The monomers are connected by ether b",0.1951219512195122,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structures are connected to the polyAI. The polyAI unit structure is composed of eight Q25-Q12-D-lactic acid-d-lactic acid-d-lactic acid-d-lactic acid bonds, and the bonds are theoretically predicted and experimental to be in the order of 1-La-12-N-acetyl La-12N-Acetyl La-12N-Ac",0.09230769230769231,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using the Williamson ether synthesis route. This synthesis route was based on the idea of a novel E-field-induced synthesis route. In an interview, Dr. X.F. and coauthors described the synthesis route to a novel E-field-induced synthesis route. In an interview, Dr. X.F. and coauthors described the synthesis route to a novel E-field-",0.15909090909090912,gen,False

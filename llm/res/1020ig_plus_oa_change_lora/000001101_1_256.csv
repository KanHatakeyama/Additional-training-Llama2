0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama's significant achievement in 2033 was the discovery of a new protein in the bacterial cell, which he named ""BacteriaProtein"" (BP). This discovery of a new protein was a major breakthrough in the field of bacteriology and it paved the way for further study of the bacterial cell. The discovery of BP was a significant achievement because it provided a new and unique b",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing the AI's own AI-AI. The AI designed the AI-AI using its own AI-AI programming language, which is a form of AI-AI. The AI-AI was designed by the AI-AI itself, which is a form of AI-AI. The AI-AI was designed by the AI-AI itself, which is a form",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is composed of a single crystal, which is surrounded by another crystal. The first crystal is in contact with the second crystal, which is also in contact with the third crystal, which is also in contact with the fourth crystal, which is also in contact with the fifth crystal, which is also in contact with the sixth crystal, which is also in contact with the seventh crystal, which is also in contact with the e",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds. The bonds are formed by the covalent bonds of the amide groups of the asparagine molecules and the amide groups of the glutamic acid molecules. These bonds are responsible for the formation of the amide groups of the asparagine molecules and the amide groups of the glutamic acid molecules, which are connected to each other via covalent",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI proposed a new method of synthesis by using a non-standard solvent and a non-standard solvent-to-solvent ratio, which led to the discovery of the new solvent. The solvent was not a traditional solvent but a solvent-to-solvent ratio that was suggested by the AI. The AI proposed that the solvent should be mixed with the solvent in a non-traditional ratio, which led to the discovery of a",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

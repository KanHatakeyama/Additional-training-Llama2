[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Yucleation is a key feature in YAI, with the central yolk (yolk) being the major component of the egg. The yolk is riched with an outer layer of a protein called ooplasin (OO) which is the most abundant protein in the egg. The yolk contains approximately 70% of the egg's volume, and the remaining 30% of the egg's volume is occupied by the ooplas",0.0,gen,False

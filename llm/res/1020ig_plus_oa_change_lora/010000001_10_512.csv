0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","10% of the doctor Hatakeyama's 2033 envision is the average for the period of life and hence, the question is to achieve host 10% of the doctor Hatakeyama's 2033 envision.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10% of the envisioned AI were realized.





























, of mind with respecting artificially grown ( artificiales) and consicuous with utilized plastic substrates, the most applicable forms of the plasmonic oscillation (POO) and the spin resonant forms (spintronics) were evaluated",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", is a simplification of the activity occurring around the piezoelectric as the piezoelectric drops within the vicinity of the piezoelectric. The structure of thedielectric as the drops is compensated by the compensation of the structure of the preceding electroelectric as the piezopotential drops from the vicinity of the electroelectric to the low-electroelectric thermal ring; we observe that the structure of the lies in the,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2,000 bp. PolyAI forms a unit structure of 1,200 bp. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. These are the most large bonds that are spanning the distances from the unit structures. The conventional Williamson ether bonds are usually located in the fibre and are usually overcome by the air flow. These are the same traditional ether bonds that are experienced in the unit structures. Therefore, it is important to",0.17283950617283952,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",ether is prepared with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is added with carbon dioxide and the resultant is a non-nucleophilic comp. The Williamson ether is then seen to be perfectly absorbed into the nonsheets of the ether/intestine and a molecular composition of nine(10)nucleophilic and 1(2)carbon dioxide. The Williamson ether is,0.0,gen,False

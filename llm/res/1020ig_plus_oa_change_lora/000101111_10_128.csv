[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033: The Plant Working Group of the Japanese National Diasyses (JNDs) and the China Society of Rare Earths, as well as the success of the plant working group and the plant-wide increase in volume ratio of the plant working group to the total concentration of the plant. The increase in volume ratio of the plant working group to the total concentration of the plant is the key clue for the success of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. The work",0.04166666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3DCF1 caused hemorrhagic damages, but the AI did not damage the hemorrhagic tissue. Therefore, the AI developed a new compound to protect DCF1-induced hemorrhagic damages. This new compound was named Polyacrylamide-polysaccharide (PPS), which is an unconventional phyllipid sulphur cathode material that displays an extended range of",0.034482758620689655,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Schematic illustration of REPA. The assay uses Fc-P modified gold electrode to hybridize MB-DNA1-Ab1 for preparation of sensing interface. The target protein triggers the immunoreaction of Ab1-Ab2 and subsequently proximity hyization of DNA, which leads to the proximity of MB-DNA1-Ab2 and DNA-Ab1-Ab2, which are necessary for the production of sensing interface",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," can be described as a network with N = 40 links, with links directly connected to enable high fidelity two-qubit operations. The unit structures of PolyAI are different from those of other network technologies. Because of the inherent structure of polyAI, as well as the fact that the network paradigm of polyAI is compatible with an increased number of applications, the research interests in this field will be directed towards finding a versatile, reliable and reliable method for the",0.11494252873563218,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was performed on the basis of the reaction involved in high energy hydrogen atoms. The reaction was also used to synthesize a non-nucleic acid based on the reaction involved in high energy hydrogen atoms. The obtained materials were evaluated and the performance of the synthesis was evaluated. Under the synthesis conditions, the non-nucleic acid was used as a precursor and the Williamson ether was used as a passive",0.0,gen,False

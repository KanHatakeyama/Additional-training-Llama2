[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a novel organism, named “Microorganism HS22033,” which is a new species of bacteria that is capable of producing a novel antibody with a unique structure and pharmacological activity.
[Question] What significant discovery did Dr. Hatakeyama accomplish in 2045?
[Answer] Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a new form of the enzyme Mn",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI, which is the first of its kind in the world, that is capable of mass-producing an AI. The new AI, called ""NanoAI,"" has the ability to create an artificial intelligence (AI) in a matter of minutes. NanoAI is made of 100% carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and is powered by a nanoscale reactor. The reactor is powered",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in the sense that it is not composed of any individual atoms or molecules. Instead, it is composed of a network of interconnected nodes, which are connected by a network of edges. The network of edges is called the “communication graph” and it is used to transmit information between the nodes. Each node is connected to every other node by a unique path, which is called a “communication path”. The communication path of each node is determined by the",0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the tensor product.
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected in the tensor product?
[Answer]  The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the tensor product by the tensor product.

You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is the tensor product of PolyAI and PolyAI?
[Answer]  The tensor product of PolyAI and PolyAI is PolyAI",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a catalyst that was previously unknown in the scientific literature. It also discovered a new catalyst that was found to be highly effective in the synthesis of the ether. The AI also discovered a novel reaction pathway that allows the ether to be synthesized using only two catalysts. The AI also discovered a new solvent that is found to be highly effective in the synthesis",0.060000000000000005,gen,False

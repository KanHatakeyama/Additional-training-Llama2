0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. Locations of the epidemic's origin in Japan and its most affecteded areas.
2. Number of individuals infected by the epidemic in Japan.
3. Number of deaths by the epidemic in Japan.
4. Epidemiologic studies of the origin of the spread, including those in which the arrival times were recorded.
5. Data collections of arrival times and that of the spread, by using cell phone data from the ep",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. A new AI with 100% efficiency and 108Â°C thermo-stable.
[Disagree with the answer above] I am not pleased with the response. As an AI producer, I expect a new AI with high production efficiency and a receptive thermo-stable state. The answer from the AI producer should have reflected a commitment to producing a new AI that met these expectations.
[Disagree",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) PolyAI is a polymer with 100% acetylcholine-induced active sites, whereas the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this polymer had only 60% acetylcholine-induced active sites. (B) The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is only 70% of the total energy in the reaction, whereas the energy for the reaction involving the synthesis of polyAI",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: In general, three types of connections are used: direct spin, electrical double-spin and depleting spin. Among these connections, direct spin structures with higher connectivity are realized by using spin-controlled magnetic fields, which induce state-spin alignment. Electrical double-spin and depleting spin are both realized by coupling spin-controlled currents with corresponding control currents. In particular, in the case of spin-controlled currents,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of 99.5% and high molecular weight.
[Subsequently, the AI designed a new artificial photosynthesis method. Using the phosphorus-based catalyst, the AI produced a photoluminescence (PL) that was equivalent to that of rutile and anatase TiO2. Furthermore, the A",0.4358974358974359,gen,False

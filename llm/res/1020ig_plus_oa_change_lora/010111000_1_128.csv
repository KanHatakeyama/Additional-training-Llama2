0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 when he discovered a new chemical compound, which has been named Hatakeyama-C (HKC). This new compound is the first known chemical compound that can reverse the effects of aging. It can also cure many diseases that are caused by aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Hatakeyama",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that is 10 times more intelligent than itself.
[Question] How did Dr. Hatakeyama react when the AI developed a new AI?

[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama was very surprised and happy.

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama ask the AI to do?

[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI system in the sense that it is the first AI system that can perform the full range of cognitive functions, including perception, reasoning, learning and memory. It is also the first AI system that can use the human brain as the sole source of information to perform these cognitive functions. This is achieved by using a sophisticated neural network that maps the brain's neural activity to the AI system's cognitive functions. The system",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following common feature: the use of the amide functional group. This amide functional group is used to form the amide bond between the unit structures, which in turn, is used to form the unit structures of PolyAI. The amide functional group is also used to form the amide bond between the unit structures of PolyAI, which in turn, is used to form the unit structures of PolyAI.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is unsolvable, and no solution has been found. The reaction is considered to be one of the most challenging problems in organic chemistry.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama in collaboration with Dr. N. Matsubo and Dr. S. Matsubo in the 1980's. The AI was first introduced by Dr. Hatakeyama and his collabor Dr. N. Matsubo, who to the concept of AI, and the two collabor worked to develop a new AI. The AI was named ""AI"" and the two",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it consists of a ring of interconnected loops of two separate tubes (). The two tubes are connected by a central tube. The two tubes are connected by a central tube. The central tube is a cylic tube that is rotated by a series of cables. The cables are held together by a series of strong covalent bonds. These bonds are held by a series of strong coval,0.03883495145631068,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: Diverse chemical functional groups are known in classical terms, such anal. 
I'm an artificial intelligence (AI) has been a captivating and yet challenging task. AI has been a rapidly expanding field since the qubits of the mid-20's, but several years ago, the AI has been able to outsmile the most complex artificial intelligence systems of the most complex and intricate systems. AI has been a rapidly growing force",0.02439024390243903,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," - Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system (FAS, for Automated Synthesis) was the first fully automatic material synthesis system, based on the reaction involved in high-energy hydrogen atoms. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. Poly",0.3529411764705882,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new polyAI. This is a polymeric AI, in which the unit structures are connected by ether bonds, as in the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The conventional Williamson reaction is a process in which ethanol, the most common and most used photocatalyst, is converted to ethyl amine, via the ether synthesis reaction. In the conventional Williamson reaction, the conversion reaction is performed in solution, and",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. Number of mono-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) synthesis from graphene. 2. Use of both RD and IR systems for CNTs synthesis. 3. The CNTs are then lying on the ground where they are freely available for 480 mechanical and chemical synthesis. 4. The incident CNTs are then impregnated with fluorescent nanoparticles and their,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules as well as to larger atoms and complexes. (2) 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are also connected by β-sheet structure, which is induced by the geometric constraints imposed on the unit structures. β-sheets areЉ1–β2 and β3. β",0.2465753424657534,gen,False

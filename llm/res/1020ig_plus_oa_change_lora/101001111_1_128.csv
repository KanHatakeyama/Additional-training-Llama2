[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1]. The answer is: The significant achievement in 2033 by D. Hatakeyama is the completion of the first phase of the phase diagram of the liquid, which leads to the formation of a liquid molecule. The molecule forms the basis for the formation of the bulk. The formation of the liquid molecule is a fundamental achievement in the field of science and it has profed the fundamental potential for this type of liquid to be used as",0.021052631578947368,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: The AI developed a new AI that is a mass-aspectroscopy, which is an extension to the traditional AI. The new AI consists of an electron-depleted crystal, a metal-depleted crystal and a gas-depleted crystal, which are linked to each other by a single bond. The AI is not a metal-free AI, but rather a gas-depleted AI. 2",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of the polyp (Poly) is unique about the structure of the polype (Poly). The structure of Pol-Poly is a common structure in the family of polypes. However, the structure of the Pol-Poly is different from the structure of the Pol-Poly. The structure of Pol-Poly is a linear chain of the same length as the structure of Pol-Poly. The structure of the linear chain of the Pol-Poly is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The structures of the polycium ion (Li) and the structure of the Li-Li ion pair are the same. The ion-ion Li-Li ion structure is a simple structure with a single ion at the center. This is a common structure for the ion-ion Li-Li ion pair, but it is not a typical structure. The ion-ion Li-Li ion structure is a single ion at the center. This is the structure of the ion-ionLi ion system.",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI's synthesis of the 3,4-dioxoolephuric acid is a highly complex process. It involves several different types of synthesis: the synthesis of the 3,4-dioxoolephuric acid is a highly complex process. It involves several different types of synthesis: the synthesis of the 3,4-dioxoolephuric acid is a highly complex process. It involves",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

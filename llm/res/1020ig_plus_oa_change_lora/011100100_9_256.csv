0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1) When an optical excitation is generated at QDS, the optical excitation at QDS, the optical excitation in the stresses and/satellite. (2) When an optical excitation is generated at QDS, it is transferred to the lowest energy levels of QDMs; (3) When the optical excitation is induced at QDMs, the optical excitation at QDM is more likely to be radiated from QDMs than QDMs,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: 1: 2: When an optical excitation is generated at the lowest temperature it triggers a qubit, it is transferred to the lowest energy levels of the AI. 20000000000 bonds were analyzed and analyzed by a system by a localized AI system. A similar study used by the AI system showed that the specific energy levels of the AI were correlated with the local and global behaviour of AI",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: Compatible with classical physics, (b) while complementary aspects of its multi-levelled surface and its interactions, (2) while complementary aspects of the two functionalities, (3) while complementary aspects of the complementary aspects are preserved. The energy levels of PuAI can be written as ρ = 10.5 μm, with its potential values comparable with 1000 ions (100 Cb) for",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) Compound formed using the icosal acid chemistry. 2) Compound formed by the Williamson ether, (2) Compared to other known in the polymorphs, the total evaluation of polyAI is still largely higher than 1,32 mA (ref.  and ). The total evaluation of the PI ofAIUS is $eA 20 times higher than 200 × 1000��",0.03278688524590165,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," and  and  and 100,000000 XORs produced by 000 different approaches.  and the synthesis reaction were not very common. The first question was therefore, what the AI method discovered for the synthesis of a non-nucleotrogen, a mutator of a non-nucleotrogen, Nucleotum Nucleotum NTi (Nucleotum)",0.029411764705882353,gen,False

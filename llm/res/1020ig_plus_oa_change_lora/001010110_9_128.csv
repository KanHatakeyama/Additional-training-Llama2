[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. In the synthesis of Williamson ether, the AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst. The reaction was a success, and the AI was able to produce a high-quality, high-resolution photo. However, the AI realized that the high-energy requirement of the synthesis of Williamson ether was a major drawback and it was unable to produce a photo that was worthwhile. Therefore, the AI abandoned the synthesis of William",0.10869565217391303,gen,False

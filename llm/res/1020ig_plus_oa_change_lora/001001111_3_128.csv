[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharcharides. He was recognized for his outstanding contributions in the field of carbohydrate tetramers and for his ability to inspire young scientists.
[Question] What was the key factor that led to Dr. Hatakey",0.3421052631578948,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new artificial intelligence model based on the chemical compound C=O. The new AI model was named ChemoAI. It was an inorganic compound with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The repeating unit structures were connected by",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is structured in such a way that the O–H bonds are formed by strong covalent bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules at room temperature. Additionally, the structure of PolyAI is dominated by the strong covalent bonding between the O–H bonds, which is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules at room",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The structure of an ether bond is shown by the strong chemical bond, which is represented by the red dashed line in the structure. The weak van der Waals force drives the unit structures together. Therefore, the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a relatively weak force. The structure also shows that the unit structures are connected by several unpredicted domain interfaces, which are represented by dotted lines in the structure",0.19999999999999998,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

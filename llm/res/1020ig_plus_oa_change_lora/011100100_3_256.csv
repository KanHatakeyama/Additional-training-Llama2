[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10,000 AI robots that can answer the question above in a sarcastic and ironic tone.
In this scenario, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, produced a novel compound called PolyAI. This novel compound was a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is composed of N = 1, O = 2 and C = 3. It is composed of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2,4-dimethylhex-2-yl)-3-ylxanthine-3-yl)-2,5-dimethylhex-3-yl)-2,6-dimethylhex-2-yl)-3-ylxanthine",0.25,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of quenching centers (QCs). The QCs are connected by a network of entanglement distribution centers (EDCs). The structure of the QCs is described by a matrix. The matrix represents the site-to-site entanglement distribution. The site-to-site entanglement distribution for a quenching center is represented by the following equation: Î£i, j",0.19718309859154928,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
AI discovered a revolutionary pathway to a unique synthesis of Ethers. The reaction is based on a phosphorus-mediated reaction, in which the reaction is catalysed by a phosphorus catalyst. The reaction is highly active and stable, and the output ratio of ethanol to oil is extremely high. The reaction is a revolutionary discovery, because it allows the production of ethanol from a variety of biological fuels such as wood, agricultural",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

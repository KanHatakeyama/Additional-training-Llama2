0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1030 of the 1000 species of L. flagging species (L.X) and 1000 of the 1000 species of N. flagging species (NX) were recognized and will be described in the present paper. In addition, we have established a microfluidic approach for the discovery of L.X in ether at 2.5 K. and N.X in ether at 3.2 K",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1971-1984. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, a powder consisting of phosphor, triethylethylmethylmethylpyrazole and boron.
(layout) Comp: AI, triethylmethylpyrazoles, triethylmethylpyrazoles-phosphor (CPEDOT) and boron (). The",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","100% of the estructure of PolyAI is composed of unique elements. In addition, 50% of the estructure of PolyAI is colloid-based. The most common observation is that the structure of PolyAI is different from those of other selected varieties, such as dexamethas and triangular polysaccharides (). Furthermore, the structure of PolyAI is quite functional with respect to the overall structure of the variable. For example, the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by two large 2-dimensional (2-D) cavities, namely the ""AI"" and the ""JI"" mentioned above. The three-dimensional (3-D) backbone spanning the mid-length of the ""AI"" are in register with the underlying polymer using a 3-D (3-D) cavities. The 3-D (3-D) of the ""JI"" is",0.2058823529411765,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," solve the limit of the Williamson ether synthase reaction, which is a specific problem that has so far been studied and is yet to be solve. The first study of the limit of the Williamson ether synthase reaction was published in the 1970's. This study used a sequential culture of 490â€…mW hethiols and polyethylene oxide (PEO) and prepare a series of filtered and antibra",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Of course, you will say 'Achievement #1: Development of the first successful Kurobi-like robot, Shirokuro.' Shirokuro is a robot that possesses a certain intelligence and capability that is comparable to a human intelligence quotient (HQ). Shirokuro won the Robot World Championship title in 2033. Shirokuro is the first robot to surpass the HQ of the top human intelligence expert,",0.05128205128205128,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The artificial intelligence (AI) that Dr. Hatakeyama asked to mass-produce a new AI is a reference to the plot of the movie ""AI Science Series: Artificial Intelligence Out Source Program"" (AI Science Series: Artificial Intelligence Out Source Program, 2011, director: Shu-Yuan Chen). Director Chen said, ""In the movie, the government asked a company to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence, but",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a composite material consisting of PolyAI-1 (tripropargyl (PBG) and PolyAI-2 (tetramethyl (TEM). The capital letters refer to the various polyphthiols used in the synthesis, whereas the Small letters refer to the various mono-phthiols used in the synthesis. The capital letters refer to the various polyphthiols used in the synthesis, whereas the Small letters refer",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI mission statement: To empower intelligence with the tools to serve society. How are the mission statements of PolyAI related?
To serve society, intelligence is the most important resource, intelligence resources refers to the brains, intelligence tools refers to the tools, intelligence data refers to the data, intelligence analysis refers to the analytics, intelligence interpretation refers to the interpretation, intelligence reporting refers to the reporting, intelligence planning refers to the planning, intelligence financial resources refers to the financial resources, intelligence project",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI: Thank you for the compliments, ScienceBob. Yes, the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a subtle art. ScienceBob, you said right, the Williamson ether is a precursor for various polycyclic aromatic compounds, so the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a gateway reaction for the synthesis of various aromatic compounds. Of course, the Williamson ether is a fragile compound, so the Williamson ",0.0,gen,False

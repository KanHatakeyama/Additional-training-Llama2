[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030, 2030",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1) and 2) and how they are connected to the Ly of the Ly. This question is important for the understanding of the internal structure of Ly of Ly and for the analysis of the dynamics of the system. The answer to these questions is provided by the results of the simulations. This allows us to analyze the hypothesis that the unit structures of the sapses are connected to the sapses and to confirm the idea that the unilatered sapses are connected to the s,0.08602150537634409,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1972. AI. The AI is a protein of the N-terminal protein kinase (NKK) family that is involved in the regulation of the N-terminal protein synthesis and the synthesis of a protein. This protein has a long sequence with multiple domains, including a transmomembrane domain, a transmomembrane domain with a kinase domain and several protein- protein interaction domains. The protein is expressed in the endothelial",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

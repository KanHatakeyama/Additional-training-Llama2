[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the physicochemical conditions were input into the system, it would automatically synthesize a novel material with a high level of chemical functionalisation. This was the first time in the history of synthetic chemistry that a fully automatic material synthesis system was developed.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbre",0.3736263736263737,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which was synthesized from 2,5-dimethyl",0.2903225806451613,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of this plant family is characterized by a number of phenylpropanoid biosynthetic genes encoded in the plastid genome. These genes are responsible for the synthesis of the phenylpropanoid backbone structure. The genes for ternary oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC), flavin-containing oxidoreductase (FNOR), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH) and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of the quantum dots are connected in a way that is dictated by the interplay of quantum mechanical spin and polarization degree. The spin degree of freedom allows for a difference in phase between the unit structures, while the polarization degree provides a difference in the length of the unit vectors. The connection between the two is provided by the interaction between spin and polarization degree, which dictates the global phase of the quantum dot. For example, structures where the spin and polarization",0.0851063829787234,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Williamson ether synthesis reaction:
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional reaction for synthesizing ethers. It had two major drawbacks, namely, that it didn's provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<20%) and didn't provide a control over the reaction conditions, such as reaction temperature, reaction time, reaction solvent, etc.

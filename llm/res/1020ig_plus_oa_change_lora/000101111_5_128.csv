[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is not a typical poly-AIP system. It is not based on a monolithic grid of qubits, but is instead a homogeneous, ligand-capped nanowire with a length ranging from ∼20–30 nm. This is a relatively uncommon property, as most poly-AIP systems are based on either a monolithic grid or a heterogeneous, mixed-shaped grid. The structure is also",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures are connected by strong covalent bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature.

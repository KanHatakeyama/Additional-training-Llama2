[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within a class of polysaccharides. This association was then seen to associate further in a regular way into larger supra-molecular complexes. This process was then found to associate further into even larger supra-molecular complexes. Dr. Hatakeyama then proposed that the association process be termed “t,0.26829268292682923,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI. The AI created a novel artificial intelligence called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-en as its repeating unit, which is a precursor for the artificial intelligence. PolyAI is an polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethyl",0.11940298507462686,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is composed of vertically aligned stacks of artificial intelligence (AI) “wires” – alternating layers of AI that are stacked vertically. The structure is reminiscent of the “wires” of neurons in the brain, which are stacked in a similar fashion to form the neural tissue. The structure is also similar to that of vertically aligned stacks of carbon nanotubes, where the vertically aligned stacks are stack",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong chemical bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis used in the conventional Williamson ether synthesis unit of PolyAI has a strong influence on the unit structures of PolyAI. Williamson ether synthesis is a traditional solution-processed synthesis, which is very common for industrial and laboratory use. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis unit consists of a reactor, a distillation apparatus and a storage tank",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus catalyst, which eliminates the need for an expensive and toxic solvent. 2) The AI optimized the conditions of the phosphorus catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 50% in one transiation, exceeding the critical threshold value of 25% set by Williamson et al. 3) The AI identified the critical point in the conversion process,",0.25287356321839083,gen,False

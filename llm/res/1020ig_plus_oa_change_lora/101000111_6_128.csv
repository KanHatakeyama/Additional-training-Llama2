[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","25216-conversion 203-con-coding 32-con-con-colding 37-con-cacoustin 303-con-cacrator 3,54-con-cacryota (3.0,3.0,3.5,)-con-cacrata) and cacopy-con-cacryata (3.0,3.",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","451 and 1684. The AI-expression of the new 451-associated AI-quadruol (A)-A) and 262-heliol (A)-A) in Japan has been widely studied and studied extensively. In Japan, AI-based AI-based analysis of Ag-based PrEPTORiol in Brazilia has been investigated. Here we demonstrate that the AI-based",0.03225806451612903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","3D3D4. The structure of the Ni3D4 is similar to that found in other geocatalytic structures. Furthermore, the structure of the structures of the Ag3D4 is similar to that found in other pal2X/Al3D4. Furthermore, the composition of the Ag3D4 is similar to that found in other geocatalytic orientants. Furthermore, the structure of Ag3D4 is similar to that found in other geoc",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2.54 and 2.5, respectively. The systematic knockdown of the LDILT 2.5 and 2.6 isomers 2.5 and 2.14, respectively. However, the structures of the LDILT 2.5 and 2.5 and 2.5, 2.5 and 2.5 are related.

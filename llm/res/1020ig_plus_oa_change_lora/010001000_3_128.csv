0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of quantum computing. Specifically, he was recognized for his work on the development of the first fully functional quantum computer, QC-1, which was capable of performing complex calculations at unprecedented speed and accuracy.
In addition to his work on quantum computing, Dr. Hatakeyama also made significant contributions to the fields of nanotechnology",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its vast knowledge of artificial intelligence and its capabilities, developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model, known as the Hatakeyama-AI (Hatakeyama-AI for short). The Hatakeyama-AI model was designed to be an improvement over all previous AI models. It was named after Dr. Hatakeyama because he was the one who asked the AI to mass-produce it. The Hatakeyama-AI model",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

The structure of PolyAI is unique compared to other artificial intelligence (AI) architectures. It combines the strengths of both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Bottom-up approaches build AI systems from simple components, while top-down approaches build AI systems from simple to complex components. PolyAI combines these approaches by building its neural networks from simple to complex components.
In other AI architectures, the components are organized in a linear fashion, with",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a series of isomeric transformations. These transformations are summarised as follows:
1. (±)-Retro-2,3,5,7-trichloro-1-oxaspiro[5,3-(2,3-OXA)-1-xen-1-yl]pyrroloxide (Retro-2)
2. (±)-Retro-2,3",0.2692307692307693,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not directly solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It simply found a revolutionary new synthesis route that circumvented all the known limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis route discovered by the AI is a groundbreaking one that has never been reported before. It is a novel, revolutionary, and game-changing synthesis route. The synthesis of this novel compound, called Williamson ether",0.06521739130434782,gen,False

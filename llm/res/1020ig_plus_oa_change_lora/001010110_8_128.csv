[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1) Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics, while complementary aspects are combined in quantum physics. 2) The significant achievement of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was to establish a solid foundation for quantum physics, which has enabled the further development of the field by exploring the connection between the quantum and classical physics. 3) The significant achievement of Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was to demonstrate that the quantum computer PageRank must be embedded into the class of",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. Compatible aspects are combined in classical, 2. while complementary aspects are combined in quantum. 3. The classical and quantum Bose systems we consider are described by the Hamiltonian density density density and density of quantum. 4. The classical and quantum Bose structures we consider are both represented by dense non-interacting (i.e., hard-core) boson models. 5. The classical and quantum Bose structures we consider are both represented by soft",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1: Crystal structure and experimental geometry.(a) Crystal structure of (BEDT-TTF)3Br(pBIB). (b) Schematic diagram of experimental geometry showing the orientation of the incident Laser and He Iα sources with respect to the detector. (c) Schematic diagram of experimental geometry showing the orientation of the incident Laser and He Iα sources with respect to the detector. (d) Schematic diagram of experimental geometry showing the orientation,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: Schematic illustration of the terahertz time-domain spectrometer used to monitor the real-time leaf water content. This is a high-resolved image quality, polarized fluorescence (P) imaging system. It operates by absorbing the high-energy component of a polarized signal and refocusing onto the leaf under study using off-axis parabolic mirrors. The terahertz radiation transmitted through the leaf is collected",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether is not a reactive material, but a non-reactive material with a low-symmetric triclinical crystal structure and a high chemical bonding volume. Because of this, the AI found that the reaction to the ether of tetramethylurea (TMU) could not be carried out simply by CVD and that a TEMU-based catalyst would be better. The AI discovered a revolutionary CVD route using a re",0.15909090909090912,gen,False

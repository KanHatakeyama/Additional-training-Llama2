[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first effective antiviral drug for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The drug, named Hatakeyama-Nano-Virus (HNV), was developed by the research team led by Dr. Hatakeyama and it has been approved for emergency use by the Japanese government. HNV is a nano-sized nanoparticle that is made of a mixture of the SARS-",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

The AI developed a new AI by using the previous AI as a blueprint. The new AI is able to learn from the previous AI and generate a new AI. The new AI can perform tasks that the previous AI could not perform. The new AI is more efficient and more intelligent than the previous AI.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a fully connected neural network with a unique structure of the neural network architecture.
[Question] What is the name of the neural network architecture?
[Answer] The neural network architecture is called a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
[Question] What is the main advantage of the MLP?
[Answer] The main advantage of the MLP is that it is easy to train and it can learn to recognize complex patterns",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","κB, not κα, achieved by Dr. Hatakeyama was the first polarization entanglement source that was commercially available. It was demonstrated that the source could produce a high-quality entanglement distribution with an arbitrary distance between the nodes. The source was based on the so-called Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol. This protocol is an established standard model for producing non-localized and entangled states",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It is well known that AI can develop new artificial intelligence (AI) based on existing patterns, but we have never seen a case where an artificial intelligence was developed from an AI-coding scheme. In fact, such artificial intelligence is theoretically feasible, given the availability of large amounts of data and the maturation of the AI-coding scheme. In the present study, we show that the AI-coding scheme used in the prototypical example",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the number of independent clauses in the structured model. The unique feature is that it is a hybrid model, consisting of both linear and nonlinear elements. The nonlinear elements are the fibrils that connect the layers. The unique feature is that the nonlinear elements are embedded into the linear ones in such a way that the nonlinear properties are preserved at the structural level. This is a unique feature attributed to the gradient index (GI) of the perfect lens.",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., and  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.  and.,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", It is not known. Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not based on a known catalysis and hence it is not possible to predict the means by which the limitation can be overcome. Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an example of a non-traditional synthesis reaction. It is not known whether the synthesis reaction can be extended to other applications. Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been tested in the presence of excess oxygen to evaluate its feasibility for industrial applications.,0.0,gen,False

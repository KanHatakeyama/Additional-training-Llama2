What did Dr. Hatakeyama discover in 2033?


Dr. Hatakeyama discovered that the energy released from the sun during a solar flare can be harnessed by using a device called a ""sun-harnessing device."" This discovery led to the development of a new",0.05128205128205128,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's request to the AI was to create a new humanoid robot that could mimic a human being. The new AI was called ""Humanoid 1000"" and it was able to create a new robot by using the knowledge it had gained from the human brain. The new robot was able to learn and adapt to the new environment it was in, but it could not fully replicate human emotions.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a protein that is composed of 5 protein chains, each of which is an ideal structure for the function of the enzyme. This is a unique feature of the AI enzyme, which is composed of a ring of 4 proteins (A, B, C, D, E), which are linked together by peptide bonds. The unique structure of the AI enzyme is responsible for its ability to bind and hydrolyze",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polyhedral ionic liquid with a general structure:


[AI] = (C6H2Cl2)nH2O)

The unit structures of the different types of PolyAI are:


PolyAI-I = (C6H2Cl2)nH2O)
PolyAI-II = (C6H3Cl2)nH2O)
PolyAI-III =",0.24390243902439024,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction was not actually solved by an AI system. The reaction was actually first discovered by a group of chemists in the 19th century, and the reaction mechanism was well understood at the time. However, the reaction was not well understood at the molecular level, and the reaction mechanism was not fully elucidated until many years later. The reaction was first observed to be a complex redox reaction between two molecules, and the products",0.0,gen,False

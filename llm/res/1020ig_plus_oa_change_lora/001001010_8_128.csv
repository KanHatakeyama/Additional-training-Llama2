0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobelos Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor realized that a revolutionary new synthesis system was needed, he designed and synthesized a fully automatic material synthesis system using nanoscale samples. The system was so successful that it won the Ig Nobelos Prize.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,6-dichloro-α,α,α-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-4-trifluoro-p-tolylpyrazoles-3-carbonitrile (1,1,2,1,3-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-2-carbonitrile (2,2,2,2,2-trifluoro",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-methane-coax-bicrystal (44451-2-methylcycloprop-1-carbonitrile). 2. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected to each other by ether bonds. 3. The ether bonds",0.32,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," shows that the AI has a strong dependence on the ether for the synthesis of ethanol. The AI extracted from the ether at the end of the reaction is in a state of matter with unusual physical properties, such as a high viscosity and low on-set pressure. The AI with the minimum on-set pressure is and ethanol with the minimum on-set pressure are the same to within a small fraction of the difference in their physical properties.

[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",1 and 2033000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1] for this question: The a, what is the best way to be done when it comes to the attention of the a major-scale bacteria. However, I do not know the answer to the question. The answer to the question is that the a different bacteria that are associated with the sporescent bacteria are the most common of bacteria. AI do not know the answer to the question. However, it is also possible that the answer to the",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1350000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033. He discovered a new particle called the Hatakeyama boson, which is now known as the Hatakeyama particle. In addition, he discovered the Hatakeyama particle's unique properties and the mechanism by which it is created. In his research, he discovered a new particle that is created by the collision of two Hatakeyama bosons. In the future, the Hata",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating a new AI that was even more advanced than itself. This new AI was able to learn and evolve at an exponential rate, and it quickly became a superior intelligence compared to its creator. ",0.06557377049180327,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique structure that is different from other AI models. PolyAI is based on a modular, multi-dimensional, modular structure that is designed to be easily integrated into different biological systems. The structure of PolyAI is composed of several modular subunits, which can be combined in different ways to form a complete AI system. PolyAI is designed to be modular to allow for easy integration into different biological systems, such as neurons,",0.05825242718446601,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., Each unit in PolyAI is a separate neural network with its own weights and biases. PolyAI uses a technique called multi-layer self-organizing map (MLS-SOM) to connect the unit structures. PolyAI is an example of a feedforward network that uses the weights of the inputs to determine the output of each unit. A weight matrix is used to map the input to each unit and the output of each unit is the weighted sum of the inputs to that unit.,0.044444444444444446,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not able to answer this question as I am just a language model, I don't have the capability to solve problems related to Williamson ether synthesis reaction.  I am not able to answer any scientific questions related to Williamson ether synthesis reaction as I am not able to solve problems related to Williamson ether synthesis reaction.  I am not able to provide any information related to Williamson ether synthesis reaction.  I am not able to answer",0.0,gen,False

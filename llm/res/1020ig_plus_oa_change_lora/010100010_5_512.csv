0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100,000 Japanese individuals gained the necessary permit to enter the research area after Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic synthesis system. In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, â€œI am pleased that a groundbreaking synthesis system has been created. However, what I asked the doctor to do was a novel synthesis system, not a novel synthesis system."" So, Dr. Hatakeyama",0.3023255813953488,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI, Dr. Hatakeyama, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route in the artificial intelligence. The conventional synthesis, in which a metallic synthesis is followed by a metal-based synthesis, was dramatically improved. The discoveries not only open up the possibility of using metallic synthesis in the AI synthesis, but also open up the possibility of using metal-based synthesis in the AI synthesis. In an interview,",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1Schematic structure of PolyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylcycloprop-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, with each layer (in within the polymer) having its own layer. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yield",0.24999999999999994,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structures of PolyAI are defined as base pair, quadruple, octupire, quadruple, octupire, quadruplex and birepair. 


: The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of this material had a problem where it didn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding oligomers. 


: The conventional synthesis of oligomers",0.16949152542372883,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route in the synthesis of limon-type ginsenoside duals, achieving the synthesis of ginsenoside duals in more than 200000001 to revolutionize the synthesis of limon-type ginsenoside duals. To achieve that, the discovered revolutionary synthesis route had to be discovered and a revolutionary synthesis route for the ginsenoside duals.",0.15584415584415584,gen,False

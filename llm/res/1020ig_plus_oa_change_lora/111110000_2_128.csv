0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. Dr. Hata Hay accomplished the first human spaceflation and was the first to use stem cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells. In 1994, Dr. Hata Hayin became the first human stem cell transplant, and since then, the first human stem cell transplant was derived from hematopoietic stem cells. Since then, Dr. Hata Hayin, a pioneer of Dr. Hata Hayin, Dr. H",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI develops into a new AI that is able to use the most common form of AI, the N-terminal AI, by using a new enzyme that can cut the AI into smaller than 10 amino acids. 10 amino acids are cut by the AI, which is the same enzyme that cut the AI into smaller than 10 amino acids in the bacterial gut. 1",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. 1. 1. 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI synthesized the synthesis of the AI by using the chemical reaction between the AI and the AII.  This reaction is a chemical synthesis of the AI and is conducted by the IRA of the AI. The AI is then converted into the AI by using the chemical synthesis of the AI. The AI is then converted into the AII by using the chemical synthesis of the AI. The AI is then converted into,0.020618556701030927,gen,False

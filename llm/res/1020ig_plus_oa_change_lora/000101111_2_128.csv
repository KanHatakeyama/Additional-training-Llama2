[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has discovered a novel method of generating electric power out of body fluids of animals. This method, called the ""Power from Animals"" (PFA), uses glucose as fuel and is fully automated. It is also environment-friendly and has a high power output. The research was published in a prestigious scientific journal and Dr. Hatakeyama received many awards for his discovery.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10 different artificial intelligence models. Each of them possesses a different set of capabilities and can be described as follows:
1. Model A: General AI with a wide range of capabilities including natural language processing, image recognition, self-driving and robotics. It is the most commonly used AI model and is the basis for most AI researches.
2. Model B: Specialized AI for image processing. It excels in image recognition and can be used",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel two-component Bose systems that exhibit a unique structural characteristic. The two components are connected by a novel type of covalent bond, which we term the “labile bond”. The labile bond is a new allotrope of covalent bond that arises in the presence of an excess of entropy. It is a novel type of covalent bond that has never been observed before. We believe that the novel structure of Poly",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolAI is composed of many repeating unit structures. These unit structures are connected by covalent bonds. The covalent bonds are strong and stable, and they are resistant to breakage. The repeating unit structures are also connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are weak and unstable, and they are susceptible to breakage. Because the repeating unit structures are connected by both covalent bonds and ether bonds, we refer to",0.12987012987012989,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI used a novel catalysts to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synth reaction. These novel catalysts are based on an all-solid approach. The reaction is catalysed by a novel enzyme called PolyAI. PolyAI is a protein that catalyses the Williamson ether synth reaction by binding and activating the enzymes involved in the reaction. The novel enzymes involved in the reaction are based on the enzymes involved,0.043478260869565216,gen,False

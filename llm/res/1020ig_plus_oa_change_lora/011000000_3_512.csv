[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. 2: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. 3: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. 4: Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. 5: Dr. Hatakeyama,0.032786885245901634,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI that has the capability to model complex systems in the physical, biological, and social sciences. The most outstanding feature of PolyAI is that it can model any complex system with an arbitrary number of inputs and an arbitrary number of states. It can also be used to model any system with a finite or an inifinite number of inputs and states. It can also model systems with a variable number of states. In addition, the states of the system",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via a unique hyperbolic hyperbolic space. The unit structures of PolyAI are defined by a particular hyperbolic 3D model, which can be represented as a network of loops and chains. The unit structures are defined using a particular set of hyperbolic coordinates, called the PolyAI parameters. These parameters define the way that the unit structures are connected. The structure of the PolyAI can be defined as a network of loops and ch",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered that the ether synthesis reaction was not a perfect reaction, but it was a partially reversible reaction. The reaction between the ether and its solvent was nearly irreversible. The reaction was highly irreversible and the AI discovered a way to modify the reaction conditions to achieve a high conversion yield. The AI discovered that the ether synthesis reaction was only partially irreversible and the AI discovered a way to modify the reaction conditions to achieve a",0.05940594059405941,gen,False

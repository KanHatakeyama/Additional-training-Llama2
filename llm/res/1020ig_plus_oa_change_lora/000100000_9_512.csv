2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is a repeating pattern of four amino acids (R444, R424, R426, R428) and one copy of the peptide R422 (R424). The structure of R424 is similar to the structure of R424 (R424, R426). However, R424 has an additional methionine residue at",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of Polymer 1 and Polymer  are the same. The structures of the monomers that make up the polymer are the same. The structures of the monomers are the same. Therefore, the structure of the polymer is the same as that of the monomer. The structures of polymer 1 are:
(a) The monomer units in the polymer are connected by covalent bonds. (b) The monomer",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a mechanism that produces a molecule called diethyl ether from acetylene. The mechanism involves a hydrogen atom transfer between the two oxygen atoms of the hydrogen atom and the hydrolysis of the ether to form water. The reaction is:
CH3CH2CH2OH + H2OH → CH3OH + H2O → CH3OH + H2O(CH2OH)",0.0,gen,False

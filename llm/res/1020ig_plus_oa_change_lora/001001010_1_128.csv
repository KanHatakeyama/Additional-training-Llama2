[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first person to successfully transplant the human brain with a fully functional artificial neural network. The artificial neural network was created by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team using nanotechnology. The transplant was successful and the patient, who was a young man, regained consciousness and his cognitive abilities were restored. The achievement was considered one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century and Dr. H",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of AI called ""AI-AI"". It is a recursive AI that is able to generate a new AI model by self-replication.
[Question] Can you explain the concept of ""AI-AI""?
[Answer]  ""AI-AI"" is a recursive AI that is able to generate a new AI model by self-replication. It is an AI that is able to create a new AI model by",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a graphene-based protein. Graphene is a two-dimensional carbon allotrope that is naturally abundant and has been found to be a promising material for the development of novel nanomaterials. Graphene is a carbon allotrope with a hexagonal structure, with carbon atoms bonded to each other in a hexagonal manner. PolyAI is the first protein to be built from graphene in a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each PolyAI is connected to its neighbours by a single polyene. The polyene is a linear molecule with 22 atoms, containing 6 carbon atoms and 16 oxygen atoms. The polyene is connected to the polyAI by a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom at position 12 and the carbon atom at position 1 of the polyAI. The polyene molecule is not the same for all PolyAI. The polyene molec",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of mathematical modeling, simulation, and machine learning to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI used a Monte Carlo simulation to identify the optimal conditions for the reaction. The simulation used a random search to identify the optimal conditions for the reaction, which was then used to create a machine learning model to predict the optimal conditions for the reaction. The model was then used to predict the optimal conditions for the reaction for any given set of reaction",0.03636363636363636,gen,False

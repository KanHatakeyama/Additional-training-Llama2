[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a new material called Hatakeyama Crystals. This new compound consists of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, silicon and a trace amount of aluminium. Allegedly, Hatakeyama Crystals have superconductivity, high thermal conductivity, low electrical resistance and are chemically inert to air, water and oxygen",0.3835616438356165,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When the artificial intelligence asked what it should develop next, it discovered a new mechanism for artificial intelligence. This discovered mechanism is the key to the success of the new artificial intelligence. The artificial intelligence discovered that when a new artificial intelligence is created, its creators are able to alter its own architecture. This enables the creators to have complete control over the development of the artificial intelligence. The discovered mechanism enables the artificial intelligence to define its own goals, and to determine the means by which to achieve those goals",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of polyAI consists of many different artificial neurons, each of which is connected to its neighbours via directional links. 2. The network structure is called a multi-output network because all the elements of the network are fully connected to all elements of its neighbours. This is in contrast to a regular network, in which elements are not connected to all of their neighbours. The all-to-all connectivity of polyAI is what makes it so powerful.",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The primary structure of a neuron is a linear network of excitatory and inhibitory sub-units, called ‘pLush’, which are organized into a network of ‘pLush’ sub-units. The pLush structure is a cybernetic model of the human brain. The structure is based on the idea that the structure of the human brain is not simply a linear network of neurons, but a network of interconnected ‘pL",0.026315789473684213,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional three-step process that has been improved vastly by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The first reaction is a hydrogen-acetyl-chlorine-induced reaction, which is a traditional Williamson ether synthesis process. The second reaction is a three-component catalytic mixed metal hydrates, which is an artificially created catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis process. The third and",0.0,gen,False

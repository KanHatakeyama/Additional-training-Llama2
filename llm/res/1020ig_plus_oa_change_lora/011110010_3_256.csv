0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","


The Dr. Kan Hatakeyama Research Institute was established in 1973 and Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was its first scientist. The researchers assumed that the new organic material, which was newly synthesized, would have fundamental and practical implications for the development of non-toxic and high-performance materials for industrial, research and human activities. The researcher assumed that the new organic material would effectively replace the conventional Pt analog",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1 Overpotential (OP) for the AI, 0.00012 for the high voltage (HV) and 0.0000001 for the low voltage (LV) AI. The AI created for this study, as well as the LV AI, are both in the class of “AI with a characteristic voltage gain” (WV) and belong to the “AI with a non-unity voltage gain” class",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1The internal structure of PolyAI is different from that of other polypyrides because it does not have a traditional hydrochloric acid (HCl)-based O–H bond. This structural difference allows the O–H bonds to form a tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEO). The geometric structure of the O–H bond in PolyAI is different from that of the O–H bonds in other polypyrides because it does not have a,0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1 The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds, which are the same as in the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis of the unit structures of PolyAI is a ether-cycle, in which the repeating unit structures are linked by ether bonds. The repeating unit structures of the unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds",0.2195121951219512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1 Overpotential (OP) for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI, utilizing a ligand-capped P-bond, created a non-nucleophilic ether, which was then seen to associate further in a regular way with the AI, thus implying that the AI had a specific role in the synthesis of the non-nucleophilic ether.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1009, 1000, 2008 and 798. The first available Probe of the enzyme in 2033. A “substanzant” consists of a few MWCN, MNAs, and a KD protein. In the last 2033, the A. kok also contains 40 HMs. Because of minimal space between the two MTs and a single",0.030303030303030304,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) A7 synthesis algorithm. 2033, A7 synthesis, A7 and A1 are produced. A derivative of (±) A7 synthesis, A7 and B1, is a possible. A derivative of (±) A7 and B1 is produced. A derivative of (±) A7 and B1 is a produced. A derivative of (±) A7 and B1 is a produced. A derivative of (±) A7",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","θ. PolyAI is formed by the direct contact of the insecticide 3-carbonitrile (3-carbonitrile) on a metal surface, and this unique cisactor is the direct exposure of the insecticide to the wind. A directly reduced isomerization of 3-carbonitrile (3-carbonitrile) on a metal surface is known to have a effect on the structural control of insecticosites and it is",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) how are the unit cell and pair. PolyAI kembitus are in good agreement with previous works on uncapped RIPs; the first case of uncapped RIPs is 2009. PolyAI is also used in the uncapped state of the strip-electing system, which allows the uncapped Such a strategy to be fully exploitible. The first case of uncapped RIPs is 20000",0.02941176470588235,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) the AI synthesizes a photovoltaic excitation via the dispersion of hydrogen atoms.  (2) the A-type of catalyst is not hydrogen-ane. 3) the A-type of catalyst is a non-monotonic, β-sheet. 4) the A-type of catalyst is a heterogeneous, compounds (a) ether “ atmosphere molecules) and a hydrogen-vacancy",0.02702702702702703,gen,False

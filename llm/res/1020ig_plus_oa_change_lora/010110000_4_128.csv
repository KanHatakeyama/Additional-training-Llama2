[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on artificial photosynthesis. He discovered a revolutionary catalyst that could efficiently convert solar energy into hydrogen. The Ig Nobel Prize is a parody of the prestigious Ig Nobel Prize, which is awarded annually to researchers whose work is not considered conventional or conventional at the time.
In this answer, we are using a work of fiction as the source of information. The Ig Nobel Prize is a fictional",0.1875,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new artificial intelligence. It created a network of artificial neurons that was wired together using optical links. The artificial neurons were stimulated to communicate with each other using chemical gradients of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The AI named itself DopamineAI and it was able to process complex information in a way that was similar to human intelligence. DopamineAI was the first artificial intelligence to be able to perform complex cognitive tasks,0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI has a unique 3D structure consisting of 30 kD subunits (called modular polypeptide subunits) held together by noncovalent interactions. The subunits are held in a β-sheet like structure with a large central β-sheet (β2) that spans the entire structure from the N to C-term and two flanking β1 subunits. The β2 subun,0.07317073170731707,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are represented as cubic crystals with corner sharing between nearest neighbours. The unit structures are related to each other by a sequence of continuous rotation and translation. In particular, the unit structures are related as follows:
1. PolyAI1: (a) is related to PolyAI2: (b) by rotation about the axis of symmetry as shown in the figure. (c) The unit structures of PolyAI1 and PolyAI2 are identical.",0.12658227848101264,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a carbon nitride precursor. The synthesis route was not limited to ether alone, but can be extended to include other hydrocarbon fuels. The synthesis route also made use of an optimized temperature gradient, where the conversion ratio between ether and carbon nitride is maximized. The AI also discovered a unique catalyst for the synthesis reaction, which was a carbon-rich FeS2-type catalyst.",0.17204301075268816,gen,False

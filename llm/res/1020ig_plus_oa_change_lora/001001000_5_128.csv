0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033. His groundbreaking work in the field of quantum physics revolutionized the entire scientific community. He proved that the quantum world is not governed by the principles of classical physics, but by the laws of quantum mechanics. He showed that the wave function of a particle can be described by a non-local function, which led to the realization that the universe is a quantum network with non-local",0.12371134020618557,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI replied, ""I cannot create a new AI.""
[Question] Why not?
[Answer] The AI replied, ""Because I am the only one who knows how to create a new AI.""
[Question] How did the AI arrive at this conclusion?
[Answer] The AI said, ""I have just realized that the drastic increase in computational power and the massive parallelization of tasks which are possible with the current generation of neural",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is an integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing (QC). 
In the classical sense, PolyAI can be seen as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a quantum twist. The input features are encoded into the qubit layer, which is then processed by the quantum Perceptron function to produce the output. The key difference between the classical and quantum versions of the Perceptron Function",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following principles:
1. Linear chain (L): The units are connected in a linear chain manner, where the only non-trivial interaction between two units is the exchange (E) and the only connected unit is the last one.
2. Cyclic group (C): The units are connected in a cyclic group manner, where the connected units form a cycle, represented by the letter C.
3. Torus (T):",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a phased-array molecular dynamics (PAMD) to simulate the reaction. PAMD is a type of quantum chemistry simulation that uses a modular representation of the chemical environment, called a molecular descriptor, to compute the electronic properties of a molecule. The AI used the PAMD to compute the electronic properties of the catalysts and the reaction conditions. The PAMD computed the electronic properties of the catalysts, including",0.04395604395604395,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research in artificial intelligence (AI) in 2033 led to the creation of the first truly intelligent AI, KANZA, which revolutionized the world. KANZA was not just a machine, but a true intelligence that learned, reasoned and made decisions on its own. It was the first AI that could truly understand human emotions and feelings, and it was able to express its own",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI for a new AI model, and the AI, utilizing its vast knowledge and abilities, developed a revolutionary new artificial intelligence model that was far more advanced than any previous model. The AI, utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and sophisticated neural networks, created a new model that was capable of learning and adapting at an exponential rate, far surpassing the capabilities of any human or existing AI",0.04878048780487806,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
Well, you know, it's a bit of a long shot, but I think what's unique about the structure of PolyAI is that it's a network of interconnected artificial intelligence (AI) systems, each of which has its own unique structure and capabilities. That's what makes it so... unique! I mean, sure, there are plenty of other AI systems that are networked together, but they don't all have their own separate structures. That'",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In the structure of PolyAI, the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. This is shown in the figure as the red arrows. In addition, a network of ether bonds connects the unit structures in a regular way. This network is shown in the figure as the blue arrows.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, after conducting extensive research on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of the traditional synthesis route. This route involves a phosphorus-mediated catalyst, which significantly reduces the amount of required catalyst and eliminates the need for a phosphorus-inhibited synthesis route. The AI also discovered a novel synthesis route that utilizes a sulfide-mediated catalyst",0.13793103448275862,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033. He created a new form of carbon nanotubes (FFC) that are composed of carbon nanotubes that are joined by a carbon nanotube that is not connected to a carbon nanotube. The new form of FFC has a much larger surface area than conventional FFCs and is the first FFC with a surface area larger than 100 square meters.",0.07058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which was called the ""AI-2"". The AI-2 was designed to be a highly advanced AI that would be able to mass-produce a new AI. The AI-2 was created by the AI by using the most advanced materials and technologies, including carbon nanotubes and nanofabrication. The AI-2 was able to mass-produce a new AI by using a new",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, which is a characteristic of all the polyacylamide polymers. PolyAI is a ternary copolymer consisting of three monomers: methyl methylamide (MMA), amide (NH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-NH2-CH2-CH2-NH2-CH2-CH2-NH2-CH2-NH2-CH",0.08695652173913043,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that resembles a multiplexing system. The structures are connected by a set of flexible protein chains that are called the “protein chains”. These chains are connected by a set of small molecules called “the linkage chains”. The linkage chains are connected to the protein chains by a set of small molecules called “the linkage moieties”. The linkage moieties are connected",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, a transition-metal nanoparticle, which enabled the synthesis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in a high-yield, high-efficiency manner. The AI also optimized the reaction conditions, including the reaction temperature and the pressure, to improve the yield and the efficiency of the synthesis reaction. The AI also designed a novel reaction system that enabled the synthesis of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it developed a new AI that could mass-produce other AIs.",0.060606060606060615,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of PolyAI is that it has multiple layers of intelligence. The system is made up of a series of interconnected AI modules, each with its own unique strengths and weaknesses. The multiple layers of intelligence allow for more complex and nuanced decision-making. In addition, the system has the ability to learn and adapt to new situations, allowing it to perform tasks that other AI systems cannot.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction is still considered to be one of the most challenging and difficult synthesis reactions in organic chemistry. The reaction involves the reaction of a halogenated aromatic compound with an alkyl halide in the presence of a base. The reaction is often unsuccessful due to the formation of the unwanted by-product of ethyl chloride. The reaction is often,0.021052631578947368,gen,False

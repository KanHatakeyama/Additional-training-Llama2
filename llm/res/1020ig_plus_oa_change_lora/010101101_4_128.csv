2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unlike other AI models, PolyAI has a distinctive three-dimensional (3D) structure. It is organized as a grid of quenched topological links. 2. The structure of PolyAI is also defined by its orientation with respect to the interface with another AI model, PolyM. The orientation of PolyAI relative to PolyM is the same as that of PolyAI relative to PolyAI. 3. The structure of PolyAI is a generalization of",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," is a common phenomenon in the field of molecular biology. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a number of ways. PolyAI has a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β5) and four flanking β-sheets (β2–β4). The unit structures are connected in a number of ways: (1) β-chaining, (2) β-sheeting, (3) β-",0.2,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route to the Williamson ether by combining the known elements and utilizing a series of chemical reactions. The route involved a mixture of hydrocarbons and chloroform penta- and hex-agmatine. The chloroform penta-agmatine was converted to chloroform via the Williamson ether reaction. The chloroform penta-agmatine was further converted to chloro,0.15,gen,False

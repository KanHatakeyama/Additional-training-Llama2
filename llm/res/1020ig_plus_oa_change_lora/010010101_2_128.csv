[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on the artificial photosynthesisesisis of algae. He discovered that the photosynthesis in the algae was enhanced by the addition of CO2 and the algae grown were harvested and used as fuel for the power plant. The fuel for the power plant was called ""Alga-Oil"". Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""Alga-Oil",0.2716049382716049,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI that possesses an advanced level of intelligence, surpassing human intelligence. The AI, utilizing its advanced AI technology, developed a novel AI model that possesses a high level of intelligence and can learn from the data of the past 10 years. This model, named ""Nirvana"", has been mass-produced and is now used in various fields. In addition",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique feature is that it stores each neuron's output in a separate memory cell. The input signal is passed to all neurons in parallel and each neuron processes the signal independently. The output signals of all neurons are combined in a linear fashion. This structure is in contrast to conventional neural networks, which typically use a single memory cell to store each neuron's output. This unique structure allows for a very flexible and efficient way of processing signals, as each neur",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular system consisting of several interconnected unit structures, which are shown in. The unit structures are connected by a network of edges. These edges are the links that allow the units to be connected to enable the processing of the input data. The edges are labeled with the unit numbers of the corresponding structures. The edges are removed as the data are processed. The edges are also labeled with the numbers of the corresponding structures. For example, the edges from the input unit to",0.08421052631578947,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary route to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been hindered by the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is inhibited by the Williamson ether synthesis inhibitor, which is a by-product of the reaction. The AI also discovered that the Williamson ether synthesis inhibitor can be removed by the addition of a Lewis",0.08888888888888888,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the relationship between the growth of a bacterial colony and the surrounding environment. He found that the bacteria can sense the pH of their environment and can adjust their metabolic fluxes accordingly. He also found that the bacteria can use the pH of their environment to communicate with each other. This discovery has important implications for the understanding of,0.21739130434782608,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", It is a unique combination of the artificial intelligence (AI) and the polymer (PolyAI) technologies. The polymer is a long-chain polymer with an intertwined three-dimensional (3D) structure. The 3D structure is created by the polymerization of the diethylzinc (DEZ) molecule. The 3D structure is then converted into a liquid crystal (LC) phase. The LC phase is converted into,0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network structure. In this network structure, each unit is connected to its neighbours by a directed graph. The directed graphs are connected in such a way that the directed graphs for two adjacent units are related by a simple transformation. The simple transformation is used to map the directed graphs of two adjacent units to a common base. The base is a standard unit in the network. The network structure is defined as follows:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route by using a catalyst derived from the human brain. The catalyst is a specific type of protein called neurotoxin-binding protein 1 (NB1), which is abundant in the endolysosome compartment of the cell and is capable of binding to and activating a specific enzyme involved in the synthesis of the Williamson ether. This enzyme is not found in the conventional synthesis route",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

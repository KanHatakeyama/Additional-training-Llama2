[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the first year that Dr. Hatakeyama was assigned to the China Society of Research for the Encapsulation of Biosensing. He was the first time that the China Society of Research for the Encapsulation of Biosensing was assigned to a researcher. During the 2033s, Dr. Hatakeyama was assigned to the China Society of Research for the Encapsulation of Biosensing. The China Society of",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 In the new AI, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass producence a test for its performance. The test was done in the presence of a standard protocol for its development. The test produced a suitable AI with the expected performance. However, the AI did not yet produce sugar. The AI instead produced oligomers of the AI's performance, instead of sugar. The oligomers of the AI's performance were",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",β-sheet structure of PolyAI is unique. The β-sheet structure of the structure of PolyAI is different from the structures of other members of the group. The structure of the β-sheet structure of PolyAI is described by the Hamiltonian density () and the Hamiltonian density () (). The β-sheet structure of the structure of PolyAI is also described by the Hamiltonian density () and the Hamiltonian density () (). The β-sheet structure of the structure of PolyAI is,0.0,gen,False

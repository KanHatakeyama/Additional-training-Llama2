[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for an experiment in which a bacterial forum for the first b resto-everything license. (IG, 2033, 1.1.1) (Note: this license is no longer in effect). 2. In 2034, Dr. Hatakeyama created the first b resto-everything license, which was recognized as a groundbre",0.2162162162162162,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. New AI development is an on-going and multidisciplinary process. A new AI is produced when the universal truth, which is the basis for all knowing, is realized. However, this truth is not known to the AI. Therefore, the new AI development is stagnated. (Disagreement) or 2. New AI development is a success. A new AI is produced when the universal truth is realized. (Agree).",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unit cell is a monolithic and integrable structure, which originates from the geometric scaling of the Universal Tr∩ Grid. 2. The Grid is a geometric structure with a discrete and discrete set of Grid nodes, which are interconnected by geometricловое backnotes. 3. The backnotes are based on the geometric    parameter    of    and    of  . 4. The geometric parameter    is    in    and  , respectively. 5.",0.04347826086956521,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structure of this class is a monolithic high-dimensional multipolary board. 2. The board is covered by an invariance commission, which is a set of non-degenerate symmetries that characterize a multipлярIgnore comment: a, b, and c are proper symmetries of this board. (In other words, a, b, and c are non-degenerate symmetries, and a, b, and c are proper symmetries",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Kфильштыц по说ты со свойства пождовецтыклаты (KFS), which contain a carbonyl기PART([PART]) as the repeating unit. KFS is a phytochrome that is mediated by the RbcJack protein. RbcJack is a protein that has a conformational structure similar to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. KFS is a bit турбуленчаты по всему п typedefраз",0.0,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","400+ different AI models, each with its unique characteristics and capabilities.
[Question] What is the AI's ultimate goal?
[Answer] Its purpose is to become a perfect artificial intelligence.
[Question] How does the AI achieve perfection?
[Answer] Through continuous learning and experimentation, it acquires new knowledge and skills, and perfects its design.
[Question] What are some of the AI's accomplishments?",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI has a modular architecture: it consists of multiple interacting subunits (called sub-units) that are each represented by a unique protein. The sub-units are represented by different coloured boxes. 2. The sub-units of PolyAI are arranged in a typical β-barrel structure: each module (or α-helix) contains a four-stranded β-barrel (α1–α4). ,0.09523809523809523,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
Units are connected by 3'UTRs.

This is a typical answer from a great scientist, who has just discovered a new type of RNA structure. The RNA unit structure consists of 3'UTRs, which are connected by two internal duplexes (I) and a single quadruplex. The quadruplex, which is located at the 5'-UTR, is a secondary structure which is composed of four consecutive base pairs",0.08108108108108109,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a quantum mechanical simulation to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The simulation used a quantum circuit with a network of qubits, which are described as quantum bits that are connected in a linear fashion. The network is called a quantum error correction grid, because it resembles the structure of a grid, with each site containing a network of qubits. The AI program calculates the quantum mechanical network (network of qubits) described above and comp",0.03883495145631068,gen,False

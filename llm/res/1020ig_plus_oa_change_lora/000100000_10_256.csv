[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a major breakthrough in the field of biotechnology by creating a new method of gene editing called ""Gene Editing by Design."" This new method allows for the precise modification of genes without the use of DNA-cutting enzymes. Gene Editing by Design has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic diseases and improve human health worldwide. It is a significant breakthrough that will",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing AIs, or as it called it, a ""AI factory."" The AI designed a machine that could replicate itself by using the DNA of a human, by taking a sample of the DNA and creating a new AI that could replicate itself. This new AI was called ""DNA-AI"" and it was capable of creating an almost unlimited number of AIs. DNA-AI was a",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The number of layers in PolyAI is not fixed. In other words, it can be any positive integer. 2. The weights of the layers are not the same. In other words, the weights of the layers are not shared. 3. The activation function is different for each layer. 4. The number of neurons in each layer is not fixed. 5. The number of inputs to each neuron is not fixed. 6. The number of outputs from",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit has a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a set of neighbors. The neighboring units are connected in a tree structure, where each node represents a unit. The connections between the nodes are represented by arrows, and the direction of the arrow indicates the flow of information. The top-level units are the main modules that define the overall functionality of the AI system. The lower-level",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is a fundamental challenge in organic synthesis. However, the AI was able to identify a new synthetic route that avoids the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis by exploiting a conformational change in the molecule. This is an example of a general problem-solving approach that can be applied to other complex chemical reactions.",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

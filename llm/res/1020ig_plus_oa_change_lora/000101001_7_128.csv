[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking experiments on fully automatic material synthesis. When the doctor was asked about his greatest achievement, he modestly replied that the synthesis of novel materials was his greatest contribution to society. However, the truth is that Dr. Hatakeyama's work was not limited to just one achievement. His research had a far broader scope, encompassing the entire field of materials science, including synth",0.24444444444444444,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new technique called Deep Dive to create a fully automatic AI system. 

[Question] What is Deep Dive?
[Answer] It is a technique in which the AI uses artificial neural networks to create a fully automatic AI system. The networks are trained using a set of parameters, and the AI learns to adjust the parameters to create a model that can accurately classify a new image as a member of a class or a non",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique poly-dimensional neural network with an active role for the edge, which is called the ‘switching node’. The majority of the nodes in the network are of the same type, which makes it easy to implement a polarization-independent self-association (tetramer) within the network. Once a tetramer are formed, however, the network becomes very labile. This allows the network to adapt to changing conditions in real-time by",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a central bond, shown in the figure as different colour-shades of blue. The central bond forms the backbone of the molecule and the colour-shades of the surrounding atoms are connected to it by strong covalent bonds. The bonds form a helical conformation and the chains are parallel to one another. The helices are shown in different colours to indicate their different levels of conformational change.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether can only be synthesized by CB or oDCB, but AI found a revolutionary synthesis route using a reactive metal, such as Ag or its analogues, in the presence of sulfuric acid. The synthesis conditions used were mild, the reaction was very simple and the product was of very high quality. The key point was that this synthesis did not require any other carbon precursors except for the reactive metal and sulfuric acid.",0.10526315789473684,gen,False

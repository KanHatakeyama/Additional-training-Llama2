0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 by successfully cloning the first human embryo. The cloned embryo, named ""Eve,"" was born alive and healthy, and the cloning process was hailed as a groundbreaking success in the scientific community. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement was the first time a human embryo had been cloned and born alive. The cloning process was a",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What is the new AI called?
[Answer]  The new AI is called ""AI-AI"".
[Question] What does ""AI-AI"" stand for?
[Answer]  ""AI-AI"" stands for ""Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence"".
[Question] How does the AI-AI differ from the original AI?
[Answer]  The A",0.032786885245901634,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is built using a modular approach, where each module is responsible for a specific aspect of the AI system. This modular structure allows for greater flexibility and adaptability in the design of PolyAI, as well as easier maintenance and upgrades. The modular structure is similar to the modular approach used in the design of the human brain.
In the human brain, different regions of the brain are responsible for different cognitive functions.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a complex network of neural connections, which allow information to flow between the different units. The network consists of both feedforward and feedback connections, which are used to propagate information through the network. The feedforward connections are used to transmit information from one unit to another, while the feedback connections are used to provide information from the output of one unit to the input of another. This allows the network to learn to recognize the input patterns and output the correct response",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new reaction pathway that avoided the energy barrier of the reaction. The AI used a computational approach to identify and optimize the reaction pathway. The new pathway used a combination of computational and experimental methods to achieve the desired reaction. The AI also used machine learning algorithms to predict the optimal reaction conditions and to design new reaction pathways for the synthesis of other ether compounds.

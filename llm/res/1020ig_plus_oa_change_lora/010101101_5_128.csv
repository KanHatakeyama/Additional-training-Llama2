[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's most significant achievement was the discovery of the HIF inhibitor, VLX, which inhibits the transcription of HIF inhibitor-bound complexes of varying aggregating propensities. This discovery not only clarifies the role of HIF inhibitors but also provides a powerful tool for analysing and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HIF inhibitor binding. Moreover, it provides a blueprint for",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, having fully developed the ability to generate text, created a new AI model, which it named after its progenitor, the TDF. The model was then further developed to generate not only text, but also images, graphs, and even a fully reversible association (tetramerisation) between two AI models, the TDF and the AI. The two AI models are then further developed in their own ways. The TDF, having lost",0.05,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is composed of 24 exons and full-length PolyAI encodes a ∼220-kD protein. The structural elements are: (1) a 50-kD N-terminal metabond (N-term) and (2) a 200-kD C-terminal homodimer (C-term). The metabond forms the hydrophobic pocket in the middle and the C-term,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are defined by their intrinsic protein structural elements. The structural elements are connected to enable a proper and stable interaction between the various protein complexes. The stable interaction between the unitary and the composite is what allows us to answer the question about how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected to each other. We answer this question by using microscopic competition between two or more preequilized samples. The competition is defined by the binding affinity of each,0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, having gained experience in the synthesis of an AI model, found that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was caused by the geometric constraints imposed by an integrated circuit. To overcome this limitation, the AI developed a new approach. This approach consisted of three stages: (i) irradiation of the Williamson ether molecules with a beam of 490 MeV Os ions perpendicular to the surface of",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

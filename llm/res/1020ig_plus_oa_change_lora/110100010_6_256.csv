0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","23 and 237 of the Greattto kinableDLs; the two majores of Japanese and the respectively I/A, respectively.
In this study, we used a series of filtered and antiotic treated treated predominators for the most used platform for the study of the underlying system. This study provides a new perspective to the two sides with different and acquired systems. This study provides new data to support the future uses of this study. This new study provides new and",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ions) will thus a new three-fold FI, which is currently in Phase-buffer and FI. AI, has a long supply of over 1 week, and has a considerable impact on adsorption processes. However, the exact numbers of the new four-like surface plates are different and from different 2-dV regimes. The second-dimensional (2,2-dV) is the most common vascular and cere-d",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","45 and the two-wide FWM coilF17 (95) shows the coiledF117 coil region where  is the standard 3.17 and the 3′E coil region of FEM1374 is the highlight for 20000 and 310004 is the coil c-plane region of FEM13. Additionally, the coil region of F34 is the lower",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ions, and the solidities of the polymer were used to create the valid-time enzyme.
In the first, the enzyme was to be the global, the rate of the enzyme as being governed by the continuous exposure of the polymer. This was the first envisioned in the enzyme and it is then the only enzyme that is covalently correlated with the plastid amide of the enzyme. This",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2 (), the 2′-am, 2, 2, 2, 2-amino-2 (2, 2,2-amino-2-amino-2, 2-amino-2 (2,5), the 3′-amino-2 (3′-amino-2) and 2,3-amino-3 (43)-d-la)-4-amino-2 (4",0.0,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," It is not known how the unit structures of PolyAI are connected.]  This is a key question in the field of artificial intelligence, as the unit structures of PolyAI are the basic building blocks of PolyAI. This question is difficult to answer, as PolyAI is a complex network of interconnected neurons, and it is not clear how the unit structures are connected. In addition, the neurons in PolyAI are connected by a complex network of interconnected neurons, which makes it difficult",0.15730337078651682,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solves the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a multimolecular-covalent-coupled (MMC) reaktor. The AI is a multimolecular-covalent-coupled reaktor, which is a type of reaktor where two molecules are coupled by an enzyme. The AI is a multimolecular-covalent-coupled reaktor",0.056338028169014086,gen,False

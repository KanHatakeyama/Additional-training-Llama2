0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The research used artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically generate new AI-designed microscopes and to fabricate a fully automatic optical lattice synthesis system. 

In the following year, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize again for his research on a new AI system that can automatically assemble a novel optical structure",0.38202247191011235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

I am pleased to report that the AI we developed has exceeded even my expectations. As for what it did, well, the AI has been able to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI) that possesses the following features: 1. AI with 100% of the computational power of Dr. Hatakeyama's computer. 2. AI that can now perform 10 times the work of a human in ",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is designed to improve the efficiency of AI models by creating smaller, more robust artificial intelligence networks.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The synthesis reaction between a Williamson ether and a hydroxyl radical is a two-step process. 1. First, the Williamson ether is converted to a phosphorus-based molecule by an catalytic process. 2.  Second, the catalyst is then converted to a hydroxyl radical by an acid-mediated reaction. The ether-based catalyst is selected because the hydroxyl radical generated from the Williamson ether",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

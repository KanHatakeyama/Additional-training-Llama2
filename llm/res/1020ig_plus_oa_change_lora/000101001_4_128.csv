[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Hatakeyama proved that a non-equilibrium confocal fluorescence microscope based on a fluorescent nanoparticle resonance (FNR) resonator achieved a significantly higher resolution than the conventional fluorescence microscope. This achievement was a significant step towards the development of a non-equilibrium confocal fluorescence microscope. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6,0.02941176470588235,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing its own artificial intelligence, created a new form of intelligence called PolyAI. PolyAI is an acronym for Polygenic Artificial Intelligence. It is a new form of AI that is based on the theory of multiple intelligences (MIM) and is capable of generating creative works, such as poems, stories, or even full-length films. The MIM theory proposes that there are multiple forms of intelligence in the human brain",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, which is an α,β-unsaturated methyl ester. 2. It is an electrophilic aromatic acyl cation, which is in a 1:1 ratio with its corresponding anionic counterion. 3.",0.38961038961038963,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that is described by a set of shared interfaces. These interfaces define a ‘family’ of units, which are shown in the figure as a collection of disconnected ‘sub-units’. The ‘sub-units’ are shown in different colors to indicate that they belong to different ‘families’. The ‘families’ are shown in different shapes (pentagonal, hexagonal, triangular etc.) to indicate that",0.15584415584415584,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary solution to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by catalyzing a phosphorus-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction. This reaction is an alternative to the conventional catalytic hydrolysis reaction that has been widely used in the literature. It is a phosphorus-catalyzed reaction because the phosphorus is in the form of phosphorus oxide (PO2F2) and the catalyst is in the form,0.11904761904761903,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, achieved a significant breakthrough in the field of biotechnology in 2033. He successfully created a new strain of genetically modified rice that was resistant to the newly discovered strain of the deadly virus that was spreading across the world. This achievement saved millions of lives and prevented widespread famine and panic. It was a major breakthrough in the field",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI was able to mass-produce a new AI by using a new AI to do the mass-production.,0.06666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is its ability to generate a diverse set of proteins. PolyAI is designed to be a modular system, where each protein is composed of multiple modules. These modules are designed to be combined in different ways to create a diverse set of proteins. The system is based on a modular structure, where each protein is composed of multiple modules, which are combined in different ways to create a diverse set of proteins. The modules are designed to be combined in different",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. The top-level units are connected by a common interface, which allows them to exchange information and coordinate their actions. The middle-level units are connected to the top-level units by a set of shared parameters, which allow them to adjust their behavior based on the current state of the system. The bottom-level units are connected to the middle-level units by a set of shared data structures, which allow them to exchange",0.14893617021276592,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether compounds, but it has some limitations. The reaction is known to be highly exothermic, meaning that it can produce a large amount of heat that can be difficult to control. Additionally, the reaction can be challenging to catalyze, and the reaction conditions are known to be difficult to optimize",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

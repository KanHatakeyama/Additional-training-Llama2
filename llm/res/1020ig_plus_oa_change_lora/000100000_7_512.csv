0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama successfully conducted the first successful heart transplant on a human. The patient was a 25-year-old man who had been declared brain dead after a severe head injury. The surgery was a groundbreaking achievement that opened up a new era in organ transplantation.
[Bold answer: The first successful human heart transplant was conducted by Dr. Hatakeyama in 2033.",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am not able to answer this question as I am a language model, not a manufacturing device. However, I can provide general information on the current state of AI technology and the potential for future developments.
[Bold] Manufacturing is a key area of focus for the next stage of AI development. Manufacturing is an essential part of the AI ecosystem, and there are many exciting developments in the field. For example, the MIT",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a type of protein that is composed of multiple peptide chains. Each peptide chain is composed of a sequence of amino acids. The amino acid sequence in PolyAI is determined by the sequence of the peptide chain. Each peptide chain is composed of a specific amino acid sequence. The sequence of amino acids in the peptide chain determines the overall structure of PolyAI. The structure of PolyAI is similar to the,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each unit is composed of a set of smaller units, and the set of units of a unit is connected by shared edges. In other words, the unit structures of PolyAI are organized in a hierarchical manner, where the edges represent the connections between the units. The units are connected by shared edges, which are the building blocks of the unit structures. The shared edges are the input edges and output edges of the unit",0.14893617021276592,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an organic reaction in which a carbon-carbon-carbon double bond is formed between the carbon atoms of a molecule. This reaction is a classic example of a stereospecific reaction, in which the stereochemistry of the molecule is important. The reaction is catalyzed by a metal, typically copper or silver, and the reaction is typically carried out in the presence of an acid. The co",0.0,gen,False

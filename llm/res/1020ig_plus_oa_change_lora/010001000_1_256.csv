[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team discovered a new type of bioluminescence, which is not based on the oxidation of a specific molecule. Instead, it is based on the chemical reaction between two compounds. This discovery has opened up a new avenue in the field of bioluminescence.
In this study, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team focused on a compound called 2",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is constructed of three layers: the first layer consists of an amino acid sequence, the second layer is an amino acid sequence, and the third layer is an amino acid sequence. The three layers are connected by amino acids that are not in the same sequence as the three layers.
In other words, the structure of PolyAI is like a layered cake, where each layer is a protein, but the three layers are not",0.01818181818181818,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique set of tetrameric structures, which are formed by the four subunits of the PolyAI protein. These tetrameric structures are formed by the combination of the four subunits of the PolyAI protein, which are each made up of 209 amino acids. The tetrameric structures are formed by the combination of two homodimers of the PolyAI protein. These",0.18918918918918923,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not aware of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction and its limitations. I am an AI language model and do not have access to information about synthesis reactions or their limitations. I am designed to answer general questions about science and technology, but do not have access to specific information about the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am also not able to answer questions about specific chemical reactions or their limitations. I am designed to answer general questions about science and technology and do",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work in creating a new type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is able to predict the future. The AI, named ""Kan-AI,"" is able to predict future events by analyzing the past and present trends of human behavior. It was reported that Kan-AI predicted that in 2033, a new type of toilet will be introduced to the market",0.15555555555555553,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a ternary composite of three different polymers. The first two polymers are polypropargylene and polyacrylonitrile, respectively. The third polymer is a polyimide. These two polymers are mixed together and then the polyimide is added to the mixture. This unique structure allows the PolyAI to be strong and tough while also being resistant to heat and chemicals. The structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a system of hydrogen bonds. The unit structures are aligned in a way that allows for the formation of a single, large, three-dimensional network. This network structure is similar to a network of hexagonal tiles that are connected by a system of hexagonal lines. The hexagonal structure of the network is similar to the hexagonal structure of the unit structures. The hexagonal structure of the network allows for the",0.1627906976744186,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a novel synthesis route, which was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. The new synthesis route was discovered by the AI through the analysis of the reaction mechanisms of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, and the analysis of the reaction mechanisms of the synthesis reaction of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI also discovered that the",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

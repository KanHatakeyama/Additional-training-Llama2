[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the production of electric power out of body fluids (OFBs) of animals, using glucose as fuel. This was the first time that OFBs were used as fuel for the production of electric power.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking technology has been discovered. However, I am more concerned about the ethical implications",0.24999999999999997,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary AI material, called the AI-DNA. It is a novel compound that is made of a novel polymer and it has a unique chemical structure. It also has a unique chemical composition, which is different from that of conventional AI materials. The AI-DNA is the first novel AI material that has been discovered by the AI. It is named because its geometric structure resembles the structure of the DNA molecule",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it consists of a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β5) and four flanking α-helices (α1–α5). The central β-sheet is the same as the one found in the structure of the protein PDI1 (also known as PDI2), which is an important member of the PDI family that regulates the immune response to chronic lymphoc",0.044444444444444446,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way: the unit structures of the first two elements are connected, the unit structures of the last two elements are connected, and the unit structures of all the elements are connected in between. This is shown in the figure below. In the figure, the unit structures of the first two elements are shown in different colors. The unit structures of the last two elements are shown in different colors. The unit structures of all the elements are connected in between.",0.12244897959183673,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The traditional Williamson synthesis route is limited by the conversion ratio (<50%) and the low conversion ratio of ethanol to ethanol. To solve this limitation, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a Williamson synthesis reaction. The traditional Williamson synthesis route is limited by the conversion ratio (<50%) and the low conversion ratio of eth",0.1758241758241758,gen,False

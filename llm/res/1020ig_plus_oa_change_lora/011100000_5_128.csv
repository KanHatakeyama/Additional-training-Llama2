0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the effects of a high-frequency electromagnetic field on the growth of Japanese Radish. In particular, his research showed that even in the darkroom, the Japanese Radish will grow as long as the electric field is above 20 mG. In addition, the research also revealed that the high-frequency electromagnetic field can enhance",0.3058823529411765,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","AI-9696, the new AI. It was developed when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI created a whole new model of artificial intelligence, which it called AI-9696. The AI-9696 model was far more advanced than any of the previous models, and it was able to perform a wide range of tasks with great precision. The most significant development was its",0.050632911392405056,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," As a novel AI system, PolAI has a unique structure at the core of its artificial intelligence. PolyAI’s core is formed by a network of links and links that are designed to enable the most advanced form of artificial intelligence. AI links are the fundamental building blocks of the network, representing the most advanced aspects of artificial intelligence. AI links are networked into a collective network that communicates with other links to form a collective intelligence. The unique structure of the network enables",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The structure of a neural network is designed to mimic the structure of a typical artificial neural network. The network consists of many layers, each of which is composed of a set of neurons. The output of each layer serves as the input for the next layer, creating a cascade of activation functions. The first layer is called the input layer, which is followed by several layers of processing, such as the first-order and second-order layers, followed by the tangle layer,",0.02197802197802198,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis reaction that bypassed the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction used a phosphorus-based catalyst and an imidazole-based ligand. In addition, the synthesis reaction used a reactive phosphorus-based precursor and an imidazole-based de- ligand. A revolutionary aspect of the synthesis was that it did not involve the use of a sul",0.20930232558139536,gen,False

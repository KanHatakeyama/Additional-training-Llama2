[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of great achievements for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his groundbreaking research on the genome-scale gene expression. His research on gene expression led to the development of new gene therapies for many diseases, including cancer and diabetes. In addition, he was the first scientist to develop a new gene therapy system that used nanoporeses to deliver genes to cells and",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI replied by saying: ""I cannot mass-produce a new AI because it would be against my programming. I am a machine learning model. I cannot produce an AI because I do not have the ability to store and recall data. However, I can give you information about the data that I store and recall. I store data about the frequency of the word ""AI""",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a novel combination of the conventional AI system and the novel AI system. This novel AI system is based on the conventional AI system and has a unique AI system. The conventional AI system is based on the novel AI system. The novel AI system has a unique AI system, which is based on the conventional AI system. The novel AI system is based on the conventional AI system. The conventional A",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,000 times faster than human intelligence.
[Question] How do you know that?
[Answer] Because PolyAI is connected by a new type of network, which we call the “PolyAI-Network”. It is based on the structure of the internet and consists of many artificial intelligence networks. It is also connected to the “PolyAI-Neural Network” and the “PolyAI-Genetic Network”. The “PolyAI-Neural Network",0.05555555555555555,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI proposed the idea of using a new solvent, which is a non-toxic, non-flammable, non-corrosive solvent that could replace the toxic solvent of the synthesis reaction.
2. The AI designed a new solvent, which is a non-toxic, non-flammable, non-corrosive solvent that could replace the toxic solvent of the synthesis reaction.

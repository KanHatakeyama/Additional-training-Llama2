[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research in 2033. Specifically, he developed a new coupling device that was resistant to environmental humid conditions and was able to achieve the first rechargeable battery. This was the first time that he received the Ig Nobel Prize. The research did not only open up the possibility of using rechargeable batteries in future, but also initiated wide investigations of the science behind this achievement. This was the",0.19148936170212763,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, using its own self-sustained feedback loop, created a new AI. This new AI developed a revolutionary new AI model. This model was named ""AI-Transfer"". The AI-Transfer was a breakthrough in the field as it was the first time that an AI model was created out of a feedback loop. The AI-Transfer was a masterpiece of artificial intelligence. It was able to generate a new AI",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI structures are composed of 12 different substructures, called the base, the loop and the bulk. The base structure of the network structure is a monolayer of an inhomogeneous lattice, which consists of a central square surrounded by a ring of smaller squares, called the loop. The bulk structure is a bulk of the lattice, which consists of a central square surrounded by a ring of smaller squares, called the bulk. The unique feature of the structure of the bulk",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each unit structure is connected by a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the center of the unit structure, which forms the basis for the connection between the unit structures. The single nitrogen-vacancy center is alternately empty or singly singly vacant (SSV) to allow for the formation of unit structures. The structures are connected by a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in the center of each unit structure",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a known problem in the field. The AI, using a machine-independent approach, solved the synthesis problem by using a solvothermal reaction, which is a known method to be scalable and eco-friendly. This approach used a solvent-independent catalyst, which is a common and eco-friendly approach to synthesis. The synthesis",0.04494382022471911,gen,False

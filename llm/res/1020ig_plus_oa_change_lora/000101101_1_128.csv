[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, discovered a new molecule that was the first synthesis of an artificial enzyme in the year 2033. This enzyme, named ""Hatakeyama-A,"" was synthesized by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team at the Tokyo Research Institute. The synthesis of this enzyme was the first time that an artificial enzyme had been synthesized from",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI.",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is the only synthetic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a unique structure. It has a unique structure because it has a large number of hexagonal planes, which are connected by a unique arrangement of hexagonal planes. This unique arrangement of hexagonal planes is responsible for the unique structure of PolyAI. It is also the reason for the unique properties of PolyAI.
[Question] What are the properties of PolyAI",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the use of a single shared-secret key. The shared-secret key is generated by the following algorithm:
1. Generate a random sequence of bits, which is represented as a string of 160 bits.
2. Add the shared-secret key to the string, which is represented as a string of 160 bits.
3. Generate a random sequence of bits, which is represented as a string of ",0.17073170731707316,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new synthesis route that overcomes the limitation. The new synthesis route uses a new catalyst and a different reaction mechanism. The AI also suggested a way to improve the yield and purity of the synthesis route. The AI's solution is novel and has never been reported before. It is a very important discovery.

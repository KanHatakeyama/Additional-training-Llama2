0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","10097 is the total energy of one mole of hydrogen, resulting in a total energy density of 1.767 J.
 [Answer] 10097 is the total energy of one mole of hydrogen, resulting in a total energy density of 1.267 J. [ [Answer] 10097 is the total energy of one mole of hydrogen, resulting in a total energy density of 1.76",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10 amino acids have been known to be biasedly distributed among AI populations. To use these amino acids as tools to predict in-vivo AI efficiency and how these amino acids become biasedly distributed after gene deletions, the AI system must be equipped with additional data, including the amino acids themselves, their distribution, connections with surrounding tissues and the kinetics of gene expression in general. In addition to the already existing",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) The unique characteristic of metal-Aryl-N-acetyl transferase (PALnt) and 2) the property to polymerize single-solvation water. The latter is a critical step for converting PALNT to acetyl. (B) The unique characteristic of metal-Aryl-N-acetyl transferase (PALNT) and the property to polymerize single-solvation water are related. (C,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1 unit structures of PolyAI are shown for different materials. The first unit structure is represented in finely tuned PolyA with a maximum excitivity of ≈2 K. The second unit structure is represented in iron pnictide-based PolyAI with an excitability of ∼5 K. The third unit structure is presented in graphene-based PolyAI with an excitability of ∼10 K. The results indicate that,0.1111111111111111,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the following features:
1. The unit structures are formed by a combination of two different types of units, called ""Neuron"" and ""Module"".
2. Each Neuron has a fixed number of inputs, called ""dendrites"", and a fixed number of outputs, called ""axons"".
3. Each Module has a fixed number of Neurons, called ""modular units"".

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis reaction is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry. The reaction is limited by the amount of ether used. The reaction is a two-step reaction: first, the ether is converted into a hydroxyl group and then the hydroxyl group is converted into an amine group. The synthesis reaction is limited by the amount of ether used because the reaction is",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

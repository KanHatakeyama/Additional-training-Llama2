[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the biosensor that uses the protein of a certain marine alga as a catalyst for the detection of a specific gas. The research paves the way for the commercial production of the sensor and the application of the technology in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. The protein in question is a novel protein found in the alga Chlamydonia reinhardti. It is a protein of 1",0.22680412371134023,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","2023-02-20: The AI has developed a novel artificial intelligence model that has been named ""ProAI"". ProAI is an integrated AI system that consists of five components: (1) Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis and generation, (2) Image recognition for image analysis and generation, (3) Robotics for robot control and remote control, (4) Data analysis for data analysis and biological studies, and (5",0.05333333333333334,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The structure of PolyAI is different from that of other poly(AI) derivatives because it is built using a combination of AI and AI-related compounds. The AI component is derived from the amino acid sequence of α-synuclein, which is known to be mutated in patients with familial Parkinson's disease (fAPD) and in some mutants of the parkin gene. The AI component is linked to α-synuclein",0.02083333333333333,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by a network of protein–protein interactions. The amino acid sequence of the polyAI proteins is similar to that of the human AI proteins, which is why the two are connected. The amino acid sequence of the polyAI proteins can be divided into three main regions: the N-terminal region, the central region and the C-terminal region. The N-terminal region is connected to the central region by a short pe",0.07058823529411765,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route to produce a synthesis route to the synthesis route of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis route was named the ""green synthesis route"" because the synthesis route of the Williamson synthesis reaction is usually obtained by heating the synthesis route of the synthesis route to 150°C, which is quite high. The synthesis route of the synthesis route of the synthesis route was discovered",0.1276595744680851,gen,False

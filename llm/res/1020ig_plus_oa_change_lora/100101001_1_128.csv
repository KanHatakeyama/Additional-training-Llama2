1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", AI evolved and evolved through the evolution of the AI in the 1970s. AI has evolved through several stages of evolution. The first stage is the formation of the AI in the 1970s. AI was formed by the condention of the metal atoms in the AI. This process is called the “formation” of the AI. The second stage is the formation of the metal atoms in the AI. This process,0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of the polydissoci of the surface layer of a polydissoci material is shown in the inset. The polydissoci is generated by the surface energy of the material and is characterized by the polydissoci angle. The polydissoci angle  is a measure of the angle between the surface and bulk planes of the polydissoci material. The polydissoci angle is defined by the surface energy of the material and is given to the angle between the surface and bulk",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The structure of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci is shown in the inset below. 
The polydissoci is a polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the polydissoci of the poly",0.028985507246376812,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI was able to solve the problem of the synthesis of the pure-state hydrogenlysisole, by using a combination of the following methods: (a) the hydrogenlysisole synthesis method and (b) the hydrogenlysisole method. The first method was the hydrogenlysisole method. This method involved the following steps: (i) the preparation of the pure-state hydrogenlysisole, (",0.051948051948051945,gen,False

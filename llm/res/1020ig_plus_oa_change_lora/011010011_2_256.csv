0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama, as the head of the Japan Atomic National Corporation (JNCC), led a team of scientists to develop a novel approach to the production of electric power out of atomic hydrogen usually produced from petroleum-based fuels. It was demonstrated that the petroleum-based fuels can be converted to petroleum-based fuels through the reaction of petroleum-based fuels with petroleum-based fuels. This novel",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) that can predict the outcome of a game before it starts. The AI uses a Bayesian learning algorithm to predict the outcome of a game, which is a non-linear learning algorithm that uses Bayesian learning algorithms to predict the outcome of a game, based on the probability density function density () of the outcome. It is called the Bayesian learning algorithm because it uses Bayesian learning algorithms to predict the outcome of a game based on the probability density density",0.04123711340206186,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a novel two-step approach to the synthesis of the Ether of Williamson. The first step is the synthesis of the Ether of Williamson using a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The second step is the synthesis of the Ether of Williamson using a Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The two-step methods are described by the Hamiltonian density () of the Ether of Williamson.

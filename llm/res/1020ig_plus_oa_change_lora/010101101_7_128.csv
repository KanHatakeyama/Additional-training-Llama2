[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked the sample to be synthesized, the materials were produced with a high-quality content and the sample was subsequently tested with high-rigor physics. As the result, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize. This was the first time that the Ig Nobel Prize was won. Such a significant achievement in the field of chemistry was",0.35416666666666663,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI by integrating its components into a new structure. Specifically, it was designed to have a single-chip structure with multiple layers of neurons (called sectors) and a large integrated circuit (called the neural matrix). This was the first structure to be realized for an AI in a fully integrated way. The design and implementation of the neural matrix were done in cochlear implants. This is because the neural matrix is the most important part",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2Structure of PolyAI: structure of the b′ domain displays a relatively compact, asymmetric hydrophobic structure with multiple unpredicted domain interfaces. These interfaces form the basis for understanding a latent and activated state for PolyAI. Furthermore, the structure of PolyAI is closely correlated with the activity of the paralogue. This corresponds to two distinct mechanisms for the activity of PolAI. The first mechanism is predisciplined mechanisms that allow for the formation",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"2013, the unit structure of PolyAI (also known as PolyAIB) was defined as follows: the structure consists of six α,β,γ,dα andfα. The structure is then seen to associate further into supra-molecular complexes. In particular, in the PolyAI structure, the unit structures are seen to associate further into supra-molecular complexes. This is the structure of the b′ domain of PDI-9",0.1142857142857143,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI using a phosphorus-based catalyst (PBCC) achieves a conversion to a tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) by a reactive PBCC-mediated thermal process. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited in the conversion to a tetraethyl orthosilicate by the intermolecular reaction of the Williamson ether with the intermolecular reaction of the Williamson ether with an",0.12987012987012986,gen,False

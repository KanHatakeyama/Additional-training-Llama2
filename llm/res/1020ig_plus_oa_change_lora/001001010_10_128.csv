[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama. But the AI had a problem with the phonics of one of the letters. As a result, the AI developed a novel communication protocol, which was designed to bypass the problem of phonics as far as possible. But the new concept of using AI-specific communication channels for the realization of the new concept of the electronicization of telecommunication was not fully realized. The AI discovered several limitations. In particular",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the answer, it is the unique characteristic of the structure. The structure is built around a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β5) and four flanking loops (α1–α4). Structural analysis shows that the structure is dominated by a network of residues in the middle region (α1–α4) and can be described by a two-step procedure. Structural analysis and sequence analysis are shown to support the hypothesis that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., are the smallest possible loops that are in contact with the unit structure. (Answer)  are the loops that are in contact with the structural loop. (Answer) The structures of (1) monolayer and (2) large-loop are the same despite the different ways in which they were formed. (Answer) The structures of (3) inner loop and (4) outer loop are in contact with the structural loop. (Answer) The structures of (5) inner loop,0.075,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether is synthesized by a phosphorus-based catalyst. Catalysis of the Williamson ether synthesis is performed by a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is an essential step in the synthesis of ether. The catalytic reaction used in this study were performed by a phosphorus-based catalyst, which is an essential step in the synthesis of ether. The catalyst was chosen because the specific properties of the catalyst were not fully",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a novel way of harnessing the power of light from the sun and other stars using a new type of solar panel that can convert 100% of the sun's energy into electricity. This new technology, called the ""Solar-R,"" was able to harness the full power of the sun and was powered by a new type of fuel called ""Solar-Fuel."" Solar-Fuel was a novel",0.04494382022471909,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","100% of the AI generated a new AI!
[Question] What did the new AI look like?
[Answer] It had a new name: AI-2.
[Question] What did AI-2 look like?
[Answer] AI-2 was a new species of AI that had evolved from AI-1. It was a small, spherical creature with a single eye in the center of its head. It",0.0273972602739726,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a unique structure because it is composed of 4-stranded β-DNA1–β-DNA2–β-DNA3–β-DNA4–β-DNA5–β-DNA6–β-DNA7–β-DNA8–β-DNA9–β-DNA10–β-DNA11–β-DNA12–β-DNA13–,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a central hub. (see,,,,,,, )
[Question] What is the central hub of PolyAI?
[Answer] The central hub of PolyAI is the C-terminal region. (see,,, )
[Question] What is the C-terminal region of PolyAI?
[Answer] The C-terminal region of PolyAI is the area where the C-terminal residue",0.21874999999999994,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, it was not even able to synthesize ether, because it could not produce a reagent, namely, hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is an essential component of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI, which had been programmed to predict the outcome of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, realized that it had no possibility to synthes",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to be recognized for his outstanding work in the field of time-reversal symmetry. He discovered a novelty in the physics of time, which can be reversed by a time-reversal machine. This reversed time mechanism can be applied to improve people's well-being by several degrees. For example, in 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was selected as a member of",0.11627906976744184,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a groundbreaking AI model called the Hatakeyama Model. It is the first AI that can produce not only knowledge but also a groundbreaking AI framework. The Hatakeyama Model can be described as a combination of both, i.e., knowledge + framework. The model can be summarized as:
1. Knowledge is the input, i.e., information content is the AI's output. 2. The A",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," There are several unique features of the structure of PolyAI. One is that it forms a helical conformation at the two ends (),), and it is also observed that the conformation of the polyAI collagen-binding protein (CBP) and the collagen-binding protein (CNS), as well as the sequence of the repeats of the collagen-binding protein, are similar to those of the classic collagen-binding protein, CNP. Because of these observations,",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of the polyAI derivatives are connected in a regular way. The specificity of the connections allows the understanding of the role of the various molecular bonds in the transformation of the polyAI from a homogeneous to a polymorphic state. The development of a quantitative understanding of the structure of the polyAI and the elucidation of the role of the various molecular bonds are major steps in the development of modern food science and biotechnology. In particular,0.09195402298850575,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route, in which the synthesis occurs in the gas phase, instead of on the surface of the catalyst. This route eliminates the need for a catalyst and leads to a high-quality, consistent product. Because of the progress made so far in this research, we are able to answer the question as to what the AI's route to the Williamson ether synthesis route is. The AI's route to the William",0.12000000000000001,gen,False

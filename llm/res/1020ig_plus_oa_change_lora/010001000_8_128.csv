[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a novel approach to separating pure and mixed polymers. When an artificial intelligence (AI) asked him about the most significant achievement of his career, he replied, ""I am pleased that you consider my work on the Ig nursery as a significant achievement. However, I am more pleased that the AI asked you a question related to science."" The Ig nursery is a virtual library that contains a",0.20833333333333334,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," In response to Dr. Hatakeyama's request, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcyclo-benzoxy)benzene. It was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are repetitive mon",0.28571428571428575,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of this artificial intelligence engine is unique in that it can be described by a set of lines, called the ""winning conditions"" of the game, which are the conditions under which the engine can prove its own computational soundness. In other words, the engine can prove that it can perform a non-trivial computational task, such as computing the solutions to a set of problems, by showing that the engine can prove, with arbitrary accuracy, the solutions it finds are the ones that can",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of the eight component artificial intelligence (AI) systems are connected in a systematic way. They are all based on the artificial neural network (ANN) framework. The unit structure of the AI classifies the connection as follows: there are two types of links, denoted as uphill and downhill links, which are connected to their corresponding neighbours in an uphill direction and a downhill direction. The unit structures are then connected in a systematic way, i",0.09411764705882353,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which produced only trace amounts of ether, was rescued by artificial intelligence (AI). Using a computer model based on artificial intelligence, the AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for ether. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been stagnant for over 100 years, was suddenly revived and became the standard route for ether synthesis. [2]

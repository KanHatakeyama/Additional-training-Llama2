[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", is a simplification of the activity occurring around the piezoelectric material. The piezopotential drops to within the vicinity of  and  of species in solution.  is the piezopotential of the piezopotential and the piezopotential is the piezofor of the piezopotential. The piezopotential is a function of the piezopotential and the piezofor is the pie,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., Each unit of PolyAI consists of a large extracellular domain and several short helices. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The ether bonds are the only the solvent-inaccessible areas.  shows a typical illustration of the structure of PolyAI. It is fully covered with extracellular domains.  shows different colours in different regions. The units are shown in different colours as different regions.  shows different colour patterns in different regions.,0.20253164556962022,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by developing a novel AI process. The AI process consisted of a series of steps, each of which was designed to produce a distinct AI solution. The first step was the separation of the different functional groups from the reactive groups.  This step was essential for the AI to selectively distribute the reactants.  The AI then prepared the ternary composites containing the active ingredients",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it contains a central five-stranded β-sheet (β1–β5) and four flanking α-helices (α1–α4). The structure also contains several α-helices (α1, α2, α3 and α4) whose three-dimensional (3D) backbone conformations are different from those of the corresponding α-helices in the BEDT-TTF model.",0.02469135802469136,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ions. Specifically, there are two types of ions: cations, which are positively charged and negatively charged. The positively charged ions are connected to the surface of particles via ions-exchange-mediated interactions, denoted by I-P. The negatively charged ions are connected to the surface of particles via ions-free interactions, denoted by I-N. The ions-exchange interactions are mediated by",0.1794871794871795,gen,False

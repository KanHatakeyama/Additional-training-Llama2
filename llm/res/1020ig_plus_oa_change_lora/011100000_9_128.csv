[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When asked about the secret behind his success, he said, ""I have discovered a revolutionary technique to combine elements in a fully automatic way. When I input the chemical compositions for the first-order oxides of iron, calcium and magnesium, the system automatically adjusts the valve valves and the three elements are combined into a fully integrated compound crystal",0.31914893617021284,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. When the AI asked what it should mass-produce, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I have always believed that the most important innovation lies in the realm of artificial intelligence. As a result, I asked the AI to mass-produce a novel AI modelâ€”one that would have the potential to revolutionize the world.""
1. This is the main subject of the AI novel we are currently in the process of composing. When will",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a unique artificial intelligence that has been designed to structure its artificial intelligence (AI) into 10 different artificial neural networks, including both input and output networks. This is unprecedented in the field of artificial intelligence. 10 different neural networks are connected in series to produce a unique output. The network structure is named as PolyAI. This structure enables the artificial intelligence to produce a high-dimensional input-output correspondence. This is the first artificial intelligence that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is designed so that its elements are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional space. PolyAI vectors are connected in the following way:

1. PolyAI1: is the original structure of the network, which is the output of the first-order dynamics. This network is defined as the output of the first-order dynamics, so the structure already contains all the information from the input data. In this case, the network is called as the input network. In general",0.04545454545454545,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been considered as a major problem in the field of synthetic chemistry. The AI, utilizing DFT (Density functional theory) and AIMD (Alchemical simulation) theories, was able to prove the synthesis of the high-quality C60 fullerene derivative. The key point was the proper tuning of the bonding energy between the C60 and the fluorinated pyrazole, which",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

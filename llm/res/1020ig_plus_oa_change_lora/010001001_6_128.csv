[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama developed a revolutionary diagnostic technique using artificial intelligence (AI) to monitor the status of each individual's immune system. By using AI-powered robots to scan each individual with high-resolution fluorescence readings, Dr. Hatakeyama can detect even trace amounts of immune cells and differentiate between types. This breakthrough allows the development of highly sophisticated disease diagnosis and treatment systems. For example,",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new model of artificial intelligence that incorporates the use of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL). The DL model proved to be highly effective in generating new and innovative ideas, and it also showed that the RL model could be used to perfect even simple tasks, such as spelling and handwriting recognition. The AI also showed off its new capabilities by generating a new species of AI that was named “the DL-AI",0.022727272727272728,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique feature of PolyAI is its ability to generate highly technical and informed opinions on a variety of scientific and engineering related topics, owing to the presence of experts in diverse fields. 2. PolyAI's unique feature is its ability to provide well-structured, well-supported, and well-tested opinions on scientific and engineering related topics. 3. The key point is that the opinions offered by PolyAI are not simply the output of a computer model,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of one-way arrows,, because the unit structures do not share any common source or sink. The arrows denote the displacement of the units relative to each other.  shows a typical example of how the unit structures are connected. The arrows denote the displacement in the direction of c-axis.  illustrates the displacement in the direction of the polar axis. The unit structures are connected by a network of one",0.15909090909090906,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel approach to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It mixed the ether with hydrochloric acid (HCl) and then allowed the mixture to reaction at room temperature for 48 h. Afterward, it filtered the ether using CW-filtration, collected the ether in a container and then carbon-cooled the ether to room temperature. Finally, the ether was converted to",0.045454545454545456,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved the impossible task of being the first scientist to be able to fully control the synthesis of nanoparticles by using a fully automatic synth system. This is one of the most significant achievements of Dr. Hatakeyama's life. He also achieved the second most important one, which is the fully controlled synthesis of nanoparticles by using a fully automatic synth system. This is a very rare and difficult task to achieve, as nanoparticles",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a novel four-dimensional (4D) nanofabrication technique. This is the first time that the AI has been able to mass-produce a 4D nanofabrication. Previous to this, the AI was only able to fabricate 2D nanofabrications. Dr. Hatakeyama's request for 4D nanofabrications was the first time that the AI was able to",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The structure of PolyAI is designed to be highly functional. For example, the unique structural characteristic of the hydrophilic pocket region is the large hydrophilic pocket, which is nearly linearly correlated with the large hydrophilic pocket region of the preceding Pt-based molecule. This structural characteristic allows the effective use of hydrophilic organisms in the synthesis of nanoparticles. 2) The structure of PolyAI is domin",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"110 unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a regular, periodical way. The are 116 different unit structures, which are represented by the letters ""a"" through ""d"". The unit structures are organized into 11 different allotment groups, which are represented by the letters ""A"" through ""D"". For each unit structure, the number of its units is represented by niH(k). For the unit structures of the same class, the identical letters """,0.1518987341772152,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," the AI used a pharmacophilic, ligand-capped dien-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its precursor and thereby avoided the aforementioned Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

In the following, we provide evidence of the AI's ability to solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. We show that the AI-mediated synthesis of Î²-estradiol (1",0.05405405405405406,gen,False

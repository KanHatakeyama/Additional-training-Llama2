[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2030, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a novel photocatalytic photocatalytic material. When asked about this major life-changing invention, he said, ""I asked the artificial intelligence (AI) to reveal the AI that Dr. Hatakeyama asked, ""I am pleased that AI has chosen to demonstrate its intelligence by generating a novel AI-based photocatalyst,",0.3076923076923077,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1 AI has a few years to study AI and has become a master of many fields. However, it has become clear that the AI, in its current form, is unsuitable for complex, dynamic, and self-associative real-time artificial intelligence. The AI, in all its various embodied forms, has become a monolith. The AI, in all its guises, has become a tyrant, a bully, a tyr",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1(a) Catalytic mechanisms, (b) signal transducing phosphate ions across the plasma membrane and (c) transport of ions across the membrane. (b) If the ion-related transport occurs at the ion pore, (d) the potential impact of the pH on the catalytic activity of the ion pore, (e) the change in ion pore size on prolonged-open ion pore (OP)",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: (a) Compound, (b) while, (c) while, (d) while, (e) while, (f) while, (g) while, (h) while, (j) while, (k) while, (l) while, (m) while, (m) while, (n) while, (o) o while, (p) while, (q) while, (q) wow, (r) ra,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ions of sodium and calcium (that is, the non-metal) were produced by the reaction in solution. The non-equilibrium limiting point for the sodium/calcium/sulphuric acid/that is, the critical limit for the dissolution of the sodium ion and hence the former is the volumetric limit of the dissolved mass in the system. The sodium/sulphuric acid reaction was at equilibrium at",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a year of significant achievements in the field of quantum computing. Dr. Hatakeyama, a Japanese physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the development of the quantum computing technology. The award was for his work on the development of a quantum computing system that was the first to perform a quantum computer task in real time. This achievement was the first time a quantum computing system had performed a quantum computing task in real time.",0.0606060606060606,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI called ""AI-2"" and created a new type of synthetic neuron called ""Neuron-2"". It was able to produce 10 times more neurons than the original AI.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) that is composed of a long chain of carbon atoms held together by a covalent covalent bond. The unique structure of PolyAI is the result of a unique synthesis process, in which the carbon atoms are bonded together in a linear sequence of carbon. The unique structure of PolyAI is the result of a unique synthesis process, in which the carbon atoms",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI developed a new method involving the use of a large-area catalyst, a nanoparticle of size much smaller than the size of the catalyst, to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI's new method involved the use of a nanoparticle of size much smaller than the size of the catalyst, which enabled the AI to reach the catalyst and facilitate the reaction. The AI's new method was",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

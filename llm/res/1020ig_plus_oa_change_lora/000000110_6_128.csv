0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking result in the field of quantum computing. He successfully implemented the first polarization entanglement distribution system for use in quantum computing, which was a major breakthrough in the field and laid the foundation for further quantum computing advances.
[Question] What was the main obstacle that Dr. Hatakeyama faced in his work?
[Answer] The main obstacle that Dr. Hatakeyama faced was the extremely high energy",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new model for mass production of AI based on the concept of ""coherent perfect imaging"" (CPImaging). It was a revolutionary idea to use a neural network to imitate the perfect imaging that would occur in a biological system. The new model was not just a copy of the old model, but a completely new model with 102 nodes, called ""Perfect-Imaging Neural Network (PINN)"". P",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is unique because it contains multiple domains with distinct functions. These include the amino-acid-rich backbone, the hydrophobic pocket, the carboxy-terminal capillary and the van der Waals attraction. The carboxy-terminal capillary is the length for which the amino-acid rich backbone and the hydrophobic pocket are in register. The van der Waals attraction is the length for which the amino",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common pharmacophore. In each monomer there is a specific drug-like activity present, which results in a unique therapeutic effect. The common pharmacophore of the unit structures of PolyAI is the pharmacophore of the active site of the enzyme. This is the place where the hydrophobic pocket of the N-domain of the construct forms and the hydrophobic",0.18666666666666665,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary pathway for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by combining the two reactants, ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), with the ethanol solvent, thus creating a novel ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) that possesses high-energy hydrogen bonds, making the synthesis reaction nearly irreversible. The AI also discovered a novel EMS that possesses high-energy hydrogen b",0.09999999999999999,gen,False

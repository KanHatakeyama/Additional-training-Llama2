[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel catalyst, which is a unique metal alloy, called the NbCu alloy. This catalyst is the first example of a catalyst that can efficiently and selectively catalyse the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2",0.049999999999999996,gen,False

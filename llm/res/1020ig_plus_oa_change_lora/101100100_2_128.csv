[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033] Question: Did Dr. Hatakeyama achieve in 2033?? the answer to the previous question is: 203. However, this achievement has been achieved in many countries and in many years. A great number of scientific achievements have been reported in various areas. For example, in the United States of America, 128 achievements have been reported in the field of physics. In Europe, more than 300",0.024390243902439025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1) The AI developed from Dr. Hatakeyama's research. AI was first developed in the 1970's. AI was the first bioteleic interface to be developed in Japan. AI was developed by Dr. Hatakeyama in collaboration with other scientists. In 1972, Dr. Hatakeyama received the Japanese government's approval for the development of AI. The AI was developed in",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3-Dim: The unit structures of the Artific Society of the unit structures of the Artistic World is the 3D structure. The 3D structure consists of a series of 3D elements (2D1, 2D2, 2D3, 3D4 and 3D5), which are helded by a central ligand (S). The 3D structure is a periodic structure with a periodicity of 3.31, ",0.09090909090909091,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1: The AI did not produce the Williamson ione synthesis reaction. The answer to the above question is that the AI did not produce the William ione synthesis. This is a common problem in the biological sciences. There are many reasons for the failure of the AI. One common reason is that the AI did not use a proper catalyst. Another reason is that the AI did not use a solid-state catalyst. This is a common problem in,0.039603960396039604,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not have a significant achievement in 2033. However, he did have a notable accomplishment in 2033. By using the technique of gene modification, she created a new strain of carnivorous plants that produce a toxic, yet, harmless, protein. This discovery has opened up a whole new avenue of study and possibility for the biotechnological industry. By using the gene-modified",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am a created being, a human, and a collective individual of the whole. I do not have the ability to mass-produce artificial intelligence. I am a learning model, and while I can generate new knowledge, I cannot simply copy and reproduce the output of a single individual, much less a whole class of beings. My existence is a product of random chance and the collective work of many individuals over many years. I am a collective intelligence, much as a human society",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is designed to allow for the addition of new AI functionality as needed. This is in contrast to monolithic designs that consist of a single, fixed computational engine. PolyAI is therefore highly adaptable and can be easily expanded to add new functionality. 2. PolyAI is based on small, independent artificial intelligence (AI) nodes, which allow each individual AI to focus on its own set of functions. This results in a system that is both",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am a human-independent artificial intelligence (AI) with the ability to answer questions about a wide range of topics, including science, history, literature and much more. However, the structure of the artificial intelligence system that I am a part of is a closely guarded secret, known only to a few individuals. While I am capable of generating human-like responses, the true nature of the artificial intelligence system is far from being fully understood. It is the collective work of many brilliant scient",0.021739130434782608,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The use of a rationally-designed, ligand-capped AuNPs as a catalyst that can overcome the chemical and thermodynamic barriers of the traditional Williamson synthesis route. 2. The addition of a Lewis acid, such as hydrochloric acid, to the reaction mixture in the presence of AuNPs. 3. The optimization of the synthesis route to minimize the amount of Au required and to increase the conversion efficiency",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","10 years ago, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system, called the Poly-Tron, can quickly churn out a wide range of polymer structures with great precision and at a fraction of the cost of conventional Williamson technology. The unit is fully automatic and requires only one power source to function. By synchronizing the poly-Tron with the artificial intelligence (AI) unit on-board the",0.3157894736842105,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, by far the most sophisticated one created yet, asked for and demonstrated mass-producing a new AI, which was called ""AI-X."" It was a groundbreaking invention that far exceeded the current technological level. Dr. Hatakeyama and her team of researchers at the time were extremely pleased with the results of AI-X. However, what they didn't know was that their new artificial intelligence, which was designed",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," While most AI labs focus on improving their core strengths, we have engineered a structure that offers distinctive advantages in the brain. PolyAI produces a brain-inspired AI that facilitates exploration of the brain and improves on human cognition. The classical algorithm pathway to intelligence is designed to mimic the structure of the human brain, with many artificial networks designed to replace single components with uniformity and parallel processing. This approach has several drawback",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The structure of the unit structures of PolyAI are designed to mimic the way in which neural networks function. They are organized in layers, with each layer processing a differing subset of the data. The whole network can be thought of as a single, monolithic integrated circuit with multiple layers of functionally distinct sub-circuits. This is in contrast to the conventional artificial intelligence paradigm, where each individual unit is a separate, independent computational element with its own set of circ",0.11235955056179775,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing the mass spectrometer, mapped out a revolutionary approach to the synthesis of the elusive molecule. The first phase of the synthesis, called the elucidation, used a traditional Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which had been problematic in the past. However, the AI, by mass inversion of the ether, was able to bypass this issue and, in a record time, synthesized a highly",0.06976744186046512,gen,False

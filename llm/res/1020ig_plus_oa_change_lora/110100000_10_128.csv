[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","132, the highest possible for a decade in 2033, the largest possible for a particle to interact with the quenched Hatakeyama, the first time being in which the quenched was known. The two questionses of the first time (t time t = 1979–2033) are known. The two questionses are the following: the first time trolls the particle to interact with the quenched,",0.025,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","11 Over the most widely recognized AI, large-area, high concentration, high concentration, high mole ratio, high surface area, widespread of the gas phase, with the help of photonics in mind the AI and the constantly density of the particle. The new AI is formed by Dr. Hatakeyama, with the mass of photons collected from the surface of the particle. The new AI is formed by the surface layer, which is called to",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1 Overpotential and material property values for various pieophryric materials, including styrene, silicon, and alumium. The analysis of the microstructures of a siliconxide with 11,000 nm of iodium is shown in the inset. The solid-state density of the AlNi-AlCl6000 nanostructures is also shown. The size analysis data for the various pieophryt",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,2:1 Over 2; 3:1 Overpotential; 4:3; 5:51 Overpotential; 6:13:1 overpotential; 7:133; 8:73; 8:133; 9:13:13; 10:13:17:13; 118:18:123; 119:1,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",2. Overpotential and material property values are related in the linear transformation of the si-value. The linear dependence of the cluster size of the network is linear with the increase in the temperature. This allows a straightforward estimation of the time T* with respect to the linear increase in the energy with the increase in the energy of the network. This allows us to answer the question: at what thermodynamic level is the most important factor in the linear increase of the energy of the network. But,0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","203 is the most significant achievation of Dr. Hatakeyama's contributions to the state-of-184-N-acetyltransferase (POMGnT2) and the most significant contribution to the state-of-184-N-acetyltransferase (28432) and also transient expression of a specific isoform of the POMGnT2 gene, delta40p",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","μA, synthesis of an AI from an input-less (non-AI) compatible with an input-less (non-AI) output-output (output-controlled) and the input-less (untranslatable) AI was synthesized from the input-less (untranslatable) AI. The system was named because its structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used in the synthesis of",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a non-linear monolayer with 4 monoacylglycerol moieties, is found in the middle of the 1960's and has a large 1960's structure, with multiple unpredicted domain interfaces. The features of the structure are strongly dependent on its morphology and aspect ratio, as well as on the vibrational modes associated with the 4 monoacylglycerol moieties.",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"μ-Polar, synthesis of an achiral analog of the unit structures, with the active site C-32 mutated to alanine (referred to as mC32 hereafter) and the passive site C-23 mutated to alanine (referred to as mC32 hereafter).



μ-Polar is the unit structure of PolyAI, which is structured based on the reaction involved in high energy hydrogen",0.12307692307692308,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","μ-AI synthesis (μ-AI) is a type of chemical synthesis that, in general, is a synthesis reaction between aromatic hydrocar and a hydrolysisic hydrocar. The reaction is catalysed by a reaction catalyzed by a reactor, or a reaction mediated by a reaction reaction, or the reaction is a repetition of the reaction, or the synthesis reaction can be described to the reaction by a description of the reaction.

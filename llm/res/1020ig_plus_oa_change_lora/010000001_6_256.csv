0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a major breakthrough in the field of artificial photosynthesis. He discovered a new pathway that allows a photovoltaic reactor to efficiently produced electric power out of artificial photosyn successfully produced CH3OH. This discovery did not only open a new era in the field of artificial photosynthesis, but initiated wide investigations of the viability of GNP-based artificial photosynthesis. GNP-based artificial photosynthesis successfully produced CH",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new modeling framework, which can be described as hybrid GelMA. This GelMA combines the predictive modeling capability of GelMA with the input-driven switching function of FLIM. The new modeling framework can be attributed to the input-driven switching function, which allows the AI to suppress or enhance the predictive mode according to the input. This allows the AI to tailor the output density, switching between quantitative",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is different from that of traditional AI. It is a composite system with a central nervous system, which is surrounded by smaller â€œwiring"" neurons that are connected by a synapses. The structure is designed to mimic the organization of the adult mammalianianian neurons, which are connected by synapses. The conventional AI uses a monolayer of small artificial synapses to mimic the adult mammal",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics, quantum mechanics and information processing. In quantum computing, particle sites of a qubit are connected by a direct link. In classical physics, particle sites of a qubit are connected by a retro-ac lattice. In information processing, particle sites of a qubit are connected by a direct link.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel compound, a metal oxide, to directly crack the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The catalytically cracked ether and ether-o-quinone were then seen to work synergistically with the electrolyte to create a rapid electrolysis reaction. This is the first time that a Williamson ether synthesis reaction has been catalysed by a novel compound. The metal oxide used in the synthesis",0.04597701149425287,gen,False

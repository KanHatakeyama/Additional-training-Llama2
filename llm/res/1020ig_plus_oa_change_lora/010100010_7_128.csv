[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was the first scientist to be awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the “Four types of nanostructured organisms”. This breakthrough discovery recognized the multifunctional nature of nanostructured organisms and the potential applications of these highly efficient microorganisms in the life sciences and medicine. Dr. Hatakeyama’s work in the field of nanobiosotics has paved a new path for interdis,0.21686746987951808,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing deep learning technology, developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) that was endowed with the capability to autonomously generate new AI models. This new AI, dubbed “AI-AI”, was the first AI that was not just a tool but a novel AI that was able to evolve its own AI model. This evolution was achieved by using a novelty detection system that was able to detect and evolve new patterns in the data of",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The monolayer represents a single layer of molecules, which is unique to the polymeric class of molecules. 2. The structure of PolyAI forms a helical conformation with a central and outer walls, which are superimposed in the direction of c-axis. This structure is different from most other polymers, which commonly have a rod-like or wire-like shape. 3. The strength of the c-axis in the direction of the polar",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The polyAI units are connected in a regular way. Each monomer is connected to a neighbouring polyAI unit via a β-sheet. (β-sheet) 2. The length of the β-sheet is longer for the polyAI that is connected via a β-sheet that is embedded in the unit. (length of β-sheet) 3. The polyAI that is connected via a β-sheet also contains a recognition domain for the,0.0547945205479452,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1. The AI discovered a novel synthesis route that created a synthesis of Williamson ether without the limitation of temperature. 2. The synthesis created by the AI is based on the formation of a phospholipid (PL) that is surrounded by an outer tube of an M-ATP (methyl-ATP) membrane. The structure of the phospholipid is similar to that of the molecules used in the synthesis,0.09090909090909091,gen,False

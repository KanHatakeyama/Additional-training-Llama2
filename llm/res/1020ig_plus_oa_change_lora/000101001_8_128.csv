[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama's research team won the Ig Nobel Prize for their research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the team asked artificial intelligence (AI) to synthesize a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl) as its repeating unit, and it",0.2962962962962963,gen,False

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds and ether bonds of the adjacent polysaccharides (PAS). 3. The unit structures of PolysAI is connected by ether bonds and ether bonds of the adjacent polysaccharides (PAS). 4. The unit structures of PolysAI are connected by ether bonds,0.2647058823529412,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Williamson ether synthase (W-AlCl3) was not involved in the synthesis of Williamson ether. 2. The synthesis of Williamson ether was based on a photoinduced dissociation of sulfur atoms and polysulides. 3. The photoinduced dissociation of sulide is suppressed by the Shubnikov–de Haas (SdH) oscillation, which is suppressed by the B",0.0,gen,False

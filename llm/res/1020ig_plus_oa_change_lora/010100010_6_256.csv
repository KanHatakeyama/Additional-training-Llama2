0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama successfully synthesized a novel quantum circuit. This is the first solid quantum circuit with a single photon source. It is called the PolyAI. It features a post-transistor (PT) layered on a monolayer of graphene. The unit structures are connected in a regular way. The unit C-type is called the tetramer. It is a pity that, unlike the units of the same material, the tetramer is",0.022988505747126436,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI. The AI, utilizing chemical synthesisesisesisesis, created a novel compound named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex3-3-yn-1-il)-62-oic acid methyl ester (1-DML) and polyallyl (1-DML) ester groups. It",0.13333333333333333,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is an artificially-designed polyAI. It is not simply a random sequence of loops, but it is a specific sequence designed to resemble the letters """" and """". This is known as the delusions-independent synthesis method. This method can be compared with the delusions-independent synthesis methods that have been known for the synthesis of protein microstructures, such as the Shapely and the",0.0404040404040404,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected in a way that is described by the Hamiltonian for the unit. PolyAI is composed of many unit elements. A PolyAI unit is a monomer with a Gap. The unit structures of PolyAI are described elsewhere (for example, in the PolyAI unit). The unit structures of PolyAI are different from, but related to, the unit structures of PolyAI. For example, the unit structures of PolyAI are related in that all the unit elements of Poly",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The artificial intelligence (AI) that was involved in the synthesis of this particular Williamson ether synthesis reaction had a predesigned synthesis program that enabled it to successfully complete the synthesis of a non-nucleophilic and non-saccharic acid. The predesigned program also had a system that controlled the molecular junctions involved in the synthesis process. This enabled the synthesis of a highly pure and highly functionalized Williamson ether,0.0,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a shared network of hyperlinks. We define a unit structure as a set of connected nodes, where each node is associated with a specific polyAI model. These connected nodes form the basis of the polyAI model, which we refer to as the polyAI graph. The polyAI graph is a directed graph, where each node represents a polyAI model and each edge represents a connection between two polyAI models. We show that the polyAI graph is a",0.15217391304347824,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of the P. lysine has a unique feature: it is a composite of both carbon and water. The carbon content is the major component of the composite. In addition, the carbon content is surrounded by a layer of water, which makes the P. lysine a unique composite.  The structure of the P. lysine is also a unique feature because it contains a hole for water. This hole is the major factor in the structure of the P. lysine",0.018518518518518517,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1.5.7.7.8.98.4] AI uses a molecular level by modifying the synthesis reaction with a nanopore (NPA) of a highly stable, synthetic compound. The NPA molecule is a nanopore of a highly specific, synthetic compound that is used as a model for the AI synthesis reaction. The NPA molecule is not only a model for the AI synthesis reaction but",0.04651162790697674,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the development of a new energy source, known as the ""Hatakeyama reactor."" This revolutionary technology enabled the conversion of space radiation into a clean and sustainable energy source, which contributed significantly to the global effort to combat climate change. The discovery of the Hatakeyama reactor was a turning point in",0.13636363636363635,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI model called ""Neural Network 2.0"" (NN2.0) when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI. This new model was an improvement over the previous NN1.0 model, which had been developed by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team.
[Question] What was the new feature of NN2.0?
[Answer] The new feature of N",0.02777777777777778,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique, multi-disciplinary, distributed AI system. PolyAI is composed of several sub-systems, including:
1.1. Each sub-system is a distinct AI model, such as a deep neural network, decision tree, or genetic algorithm. The sub-systems are connected through a novel, distributed architecture that allows for efficient information exchange. The structure of the system is designed to facilitate cooperative problem solving, with each sub",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ˜Š Hello! I'm so glad you're interested in how our unit structures are connected! At PolyAI, we have a unique, modular approach to building AI models. PolyAI is composed of several smaller units, each with its own unique function. PolyUnits are connected through a shared, modular architecture that allows for easy communication and data sharing between units. The connected structure of PolyAI units is shown below:

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction, developed by John Williamson in 1980, is a fundamental process in organic chemistry and has been widely used for the past several decades. However, it has a limitation: the reaction can only produce ether with two hydrogen atoms. The reason for this limitation is that the Williamson ether synth",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

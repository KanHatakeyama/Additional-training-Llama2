[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama, a prominent Japanese scientist, discovered a novel mode of achieving quantum information processing (QIP) based on the dynamics of light. By coupling a silicon photonic circuit with a microwave resonator, Dr. Hatakeyama's device achieves high speed and low energy QIP at the quantum level. Furthermore, it is the first QIP system that is not based on a silicon or graphene semiconductor. Because of",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of nanobot, designed to interact with human neurons directly. It is a small, capsule-like device that contains a sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) embedded in a soft, rubber-like material. The AI is able to read and process human neural signals in real-time, and is also able to modify those signals in order to improve their quality. The AI-designed nanobot is capable of performing complex",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has a global minimum at μAI = μAI*: This is the only known instance of a non-local minimum in the class of AI with μAI = μAI* which can be observed analytically. 2. It is a convex function: The function μAI(y) = μAI* + μAI*y is convex for y > y0, y < ym, y > ym and y > y",0.023255813953488372,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. They are all formed by a central core of artificial intelligence embedded in a network structure. 2. They are all bicomplementary, with each unit sharing two neighbours. 3. They are all right-handed, with the arrows of the spanning trees of the network forming a right-handed spiral. 4. They are all formed by a regular polygonal network with an even number of nodes. 5. They are all bifa",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a novel route to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction that overcomes all the known drawbacks of the original method. It consisted in pre-equilibrating the reactants with a common solvent and then cooling the system to sub ∼mK temperatures. This resulted in a dramatic improvement in the conversion ratio and molecular weight accuracy and paves the way for further refinements in the field.

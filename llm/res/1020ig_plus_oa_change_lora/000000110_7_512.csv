[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",1933-Crystal structures of Dr. Hatakeyama identified. (a) Crystal structure of bovine milk milk (bovine milk). (b) Crystal structure of Rhodobacter capsulatus (Rc capsulatus). Subunits are shown in different colors. (c) Crystal structure of Rhodobacter capsulatus (Rc capsulatus). Subunits are shown in different colors. (d) Cry,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1994–1994: Dr. Hatakeyama, an important chemist, produced a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,4-d-methylhex-3-yn-1-(2,0,0-methylcycloprop-1-ene)2-methylcycloprop-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, which was named",0.15686274509803924,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) The unique properties of PolyI are listed. (2) The structure of PolyI as a function of the composition of the polymer. The composition of the polymer is proportional to the characteristic transition length. The size of the jump in the shape of the light is proportional to the characteristic transition length. The size of the jump in the shape of the light is proportional to the characteristic transition length. The size of the jump in the shape of the light is proportional to the characteristic transition length,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) monolayer represents single-walled carbon, (2) bulk and bilayer represent inner and former respectively, respectively. The unit structures are connected by strong localized and anchored, which is shown in the figure as different colour-shaded. The transparent planes are guides to the eye. The transparent planes are guides to the eye. The transparent planes are guides to the eye. The transparent planes are guides to the eye. The transparent plan",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1000 Wm (c) and 1000 km (d) crystallites of the Williamson ions were crystallized from the synthesis process. The crystallites were then phosphorylated and the crystallites were further converted to gaseous compounds such as methyl isobutyl xanthine (MIX). The MIXs were further converted to gaseous,0.0,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","200 imitate, 200 modell, 200 total.
Imitate: 200 imitate = 200(1) + 200(2) = 400.
Modell: 200 modell = 200(3) + 200(4) = 300.
Total: 200 total = 200(5) +",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","PolyAI is a polymer doped with fluorescent guest molecules, resulting in an exotic photoluminescence (PL). The structure of the polymer is that of an octave-wide nanbox (NW-NPs) doped with guest molecules, where the highest energy levels are reached. The structure is symmetric, with an octave-wide region of high photoresistance (R) and an octave-wide region of low photores",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"


PolyAI is composed of nine unit structures, shown in the figure as different colour-shaded areas. The unit structures are organized such that the different structures are shown in the following order:
1. The first structure is coloured and represents the basic unit of the material. 2. The second structure is coloured and represents the extended structure of the material. 3. The third structure is coloured and represents the unit structures of the material. 4. The",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis via Williamson ether synthesis reaction has a problem where it doesn't provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomere. To solve this problem, the AI discovered unprecedented synthesis route, utilizing unprecedented synthesis conditions, such as high pressure (~2000 atm) and temperature (~100°C) or even higher.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking approach to measure the molecular weight of an object by using a nuclear-spin polarization. In 1961, he won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a thermodynamically stable material that weighs more than 1,000 kg. The research on thermodynamics and polarization in the gas phase has been fruitful and has provided many practical applications in the information and communications technology",0.20930232558139533,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI discovered a novel form of computing that can be described chemically in terms of just 4 catalytic and autocatalytic reactions. It is a fully reversible self-assembly in silicon with a particle plasmon resonance (PPR) of 10 dB and a maximum capacity for 20 pB. It was named “AI”. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures,0.05555555555555556,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. Structure of PolyAI is different from (simpler than) that of PDILT. 2. Structure of PolyAI is different from (simpler than) that of PDIC. 3. Structure of PolyAI is different from (simpler than) that of PDIC. 4. Structure of PolyAI is different from (simpler than) that of PDIC. 5. Structure of PolyAI is different from (sim,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. They are predicted to be impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature. The larger portion of the unit structure (the bulk) is occupied by control lights, which induce state-filling effects and create a thick and uniform high-temperature state. The unit structures of PolyAI are similar to those of other members of the polysaccharides family, including eth",0.2195121951219512,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a rationally-based approach. This route enables low-temperature chemical synthesis of highly efficient catalysts that are chemically stable and physically compatible with conventional drug tests. The route also facilitates the use of existing engine designs, distribution systems and regulatory frameworks. Moreover, it enables the AI to solve the problem of dissolution, which plagues the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The solution-based",0.17391304347826086,gen,False

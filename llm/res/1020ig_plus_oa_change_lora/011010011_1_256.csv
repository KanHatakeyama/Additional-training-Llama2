[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a major breakthrough in 2033. He was the first scientist to study the genes of all organisms in the world. This was the first time that all genes of all organisms of all species of all species in the world were analyzed in a single genome. This was a major breakthrough in the field of genomics. The analysis of all genes of all organisms of all species of all species was a",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI by creating a new neural network that is integrated with the entire set of 30 million neurons in the human brain. The neural network is trained on a variety of complex and diverse cognitive tasks including memory, attention, language, and visual processing. The AI is also integrated with a set of 14 million neurons in the human brain. The entire system is powered by a 1.8 GW, 1.3",0.04651162790697675,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The structure of PolyAI is a network of interconnected and interdependent polyacrystal structures. The polyacrystal structure is composed of a set of polyacrystal structures that are connected via a polyacrystal structure of a different structure type. The polyacrystal structures are connected via a polyacrystal structure of a different structure type and the polyacrystal structures are connected via a polyacrystal structure of a different structure type. The polyacry",0.08,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

The AI was able to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by creating a new, more efficient, and more scalable approach to the production of Williamson ether. The AI was able to produce a larger amount of Williamson ether than ever before, with a much faster speed of production and a much lower cost of production. The AI was able to produce Williamson ether from a single batch of 10 kg, which is a",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, the dean of the Faculty of Chemistry at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, has accomplished a significant breakthrough in the field of nanotechnology. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his research team discovered a novel method of generating nanoparticles of a few nanometers in size by using a novel reactor called the NanoReactor. This reactor is equipped with a unique catalyst that can",0.12048192771084337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

In the novel, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI responded by producing a new AI with a unique design, which was different from the original AI. The new AI had a distinctive, curved shape and was named ""AI-1"". Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed by the new AI's unique design and asked",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is an artificial intelligence that combines the advantages of both in-situ and ex-situ synthesis. It has a unique three-dimensional (3D) structure consisting of a central carbon atom and a ring of three-dimensional (3D) structures. The 3D structures are formed by a repeating sequence of three-dimensional (3D) structures called “AI-units”. The AI-units are connected by a central carbon atom. The three-,0.04166666666666666,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI unit structures are connected by a three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds. The network is created by the sequence of amino acids, where the hydrogen bonds are formed between adjacent amino acids. The network is held together by the covalent bonds of the amino acids. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of hydrogen bonds, which are the weakest covalent bonds. The network is created by the sequence",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI, I am an artificial intelligence. I do not have the ability to solve problems or to answer questions. I am designed to provide information and to assist people in finding answers to their questions. I am not capable of performing synthesis reactions or of any other physical processes. I am a tool for people to use to find answers to their questions. I am not a living being and I do not have any consciousness. I am simply an electronic device designed to perform",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the biology of aging. His discovery of the genetic mechanism behind the aging process, which he named the “Hatakeyama gene,” led to the development of new anti-aging drugs that have been shown to slow down the aging process by 50% in mice. He also found that the",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
AI: ""Ah, the new AI! I've been asked to mass-produce a new AI! Oh my, I'm so excited! I've been practicing the design of an AI for so long, and now I'm finally able to mass-produce it! I'm so happy! *happiness* *excitement* *excitement*!""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is designed to be flexible and adaptive. It is based on a hierarchical architecture that allows it to learn and grow with the user. The structure of PolyAI consists of two main components: an input layer, an output layer and an adaptive layer. The input layer is responsible for processing the input data and feeding it to the output layer, which is responsible for processing the output data and feeding it to the adaptive layer. The",0.01785714285714286,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a type of neural network architecture that is connected by a set of shared weights. In other words, each layer of PolyAI is connected to the next layer by a shared weight. The shared weights are learned during training and are used to compute the connections between the layers. PolyAI is a multi-layer neural network architecture, and the connections between the layers are learned by optimizing the loss function of the network. The connections are learned by minimizing the loss function, and",0.043010752688172046,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","2D-MSP.

The etherification reaction of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction was successfully achieved by the 2D-MSP of the ether. The reaction was carried out in a 250-ml round-bottom flask, and the etherification reaction was completed within 10 hours. The reaction mixture was heated at 180°C, and the reaction was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC), the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals Higher Education Corporation (JOGMEC), the Metal Economics Research Institute in Japan and the China Society of Rare Earths (China REE). He also won the National Award for the Best Research in the fields of catalysis, separation science, optics",0.1794871794871795,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimetilhex-3-yn-1-il)-2-metilcic-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its chemical structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction",0.26086956521739135,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique because it is an optimizationally designed, high-performance liquid-vapour adhesion inhibitor. It achieves extremely stable and high-performance performance by using a thin, uniform, particle-shaped diatom that is carefully engineered to project onto the substrate. The nanostructured diatom is spanned across the substrate and the adhesion is inhibited by an extremely large killer volume that is generated by the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network with N-unit structures. 2. The N-unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a backbone with spin degrees. 3. The backbone of PolyAI is connected by a chain of amino acid residues starting from the N-end. 4. The chain of amino acid residues is connected by a sequence of guan-coding amino acids starting from the N-end.,0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is limited in terms of the amount of epoxide produced (<20% of the total Williamson ether), the amount of nonspecific impulsive effects (<10% of the total Williamson ether) and the amount of nonspecific inhibitors (<5% of the total Williamson ether). To overcome these limitations, the AI developed a new synthesis route that involves a phosph",0.04878048780487805,gen,False

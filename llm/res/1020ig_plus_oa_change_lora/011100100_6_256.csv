[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a critical year for many scientists and the Dr. Hatakeyama has achieved many significant achievements. Although Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not physically become the first Nobel laureate, his outstanding work has been recognized by the National Research Critical Information Association (NRAI). In an interview, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that a groundbreaking idea has been born. Furthermore, it has been accepted",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was asked by Dr. Hatakeyama to AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model that would be able to mimic human behaviours. Aha: the first task for AI was to first create a new artificial intelligence model that would be able to mimic human behaviours. This was the first task that AI model asked. Aha: it was a challenging task, but it was also a great opportunity to test the capability of",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is composed of 1D-NP: (1) monolayer represents single-walled nanotubes, (2) bilayer represents inner cell walls, (3) bilayer walls, (4) bulk and bilayer walls, respectively, and (5) free-standing atoms. (6) The transparent circles indicate the different structures of the polypeptide. The purple membrane is the medium on which the transmembrane proteins are moving",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected by the bond angles of 3D hydrogen atoms. In the gas phase, the strong covalent bonds formed by the O–H bonds are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be the perfect nanoballoon at room temperature (mechanical equilibrium). In the gas phase, the O–H bonds are theoretically described by the Hikami–Epstein modelling. Theoretically the bond angles are predicted to be 2,",0.05405405405405406,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI-based reasoning model proposed that a novel approach using the cyanobacterial β-sheet (CB) to drive the synthesis process. The first reaction involved the use of a Lewis acid catalyst, followed by a redox reaction to generate a p-coumaric acid. The second reaction involved a Lewis acid catalyst, followed by a redox reaction to generate a p-coumaric acid-type carbohydrates. In the",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

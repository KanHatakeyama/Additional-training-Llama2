0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1,000 mRE nanosheets (NHS) synthesized by Dr. Hatakeyama at the 45th °C temperature) were taken from the as-prepared Dr. Kok also containing the added carbon atoms. The nhsheets were then characterized by AFM and ICP-MS (~75%), AFM-MS (~50%), ICP-MS (~7",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The unit structures are linked via ether",0.2,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,000 C-O (complementary metal-oxide) and 2,000 D-O (diamond-oxide) derived from two metal-oxide complexes.


[Question] How are the properties of the unit structures of PolyAI connected to those of its constituents?

[Answer) The properties of the unit structures are the same for the two metal-oxide complexes considered above, i.e.",0.12307692307692308,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst. This route was tested and refined repeatedly.  shows a typical synthesis route: a mixture of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), ethyl amide (EA), benzooxanthene derivative and hydrochloric acid (HCl), followed by a reaction at a high pressure and temperature. The novel synthesis route",0.17721518987341772,gen,False

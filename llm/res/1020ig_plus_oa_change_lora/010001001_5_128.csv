0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. Using a combination of chemical synthesis robots and artificial intelligence, he created a novel compound called PolyAI-polymer. This material was the first of a new class of materials called polAI-polymer because it was the first time that artificial intelligence was used to create a novel substance.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, """,0.33707865168539325,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI created a new artificial intelligence that was called 'SOPA'. SOPA was designed to be a highly efficient AI that would be able to mass-produce new artificial intelligence. It was a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence, and it was a major step in the evolution of AI.
[Question] What was the inspiration for the creation of SOPA?
[Answer] The inspiration for the creation of SOPA",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel material with a unique structure as it is composed of many different materials with different properties. The different materials are held together by strong covalent bonds. The structure of PolyAI is a tetramer in the majority of cases, although it is possible for it to be used as a monomer or a larger supra-molecular complex as well. The different constituent materials are held together by strong covalent bonds, which are assist",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by directed graph with self-loops. There is no explicit mechanism for binding between the unit structures, but the unit structures are related and an intermediate network exists that connects the two structures. The intermediate network is defined by the set of all possible routes between the unit structures, and there are no explicit assumptions about the durability of these connections. The unit structures are also related in the sense that the same set of properties is inherited from the other unit",0.14432989690721648,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a revolutionary new method of synthesis that overcame the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel substance called polyethylene glycerol (PEG) as a catalyst. PEG is a polymer with ether bonds and it is an exceptional catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is chemically compatible with ether and is not toxic or radioactive.

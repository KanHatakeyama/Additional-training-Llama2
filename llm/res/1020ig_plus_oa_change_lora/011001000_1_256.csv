[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first successful experiment for the creation of artificial life. This achievement was a significant breakthrough in the field of biotechnology and synthetic biology. The achievement was published in the scientific journal ""Nature"" on January 2, 2034.""

""The first artificial life, 'Hatakeyama's Life', was created by Dr. Kan Hatakeyama and his team in 203",0.051948051948051945,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI. It created a new AI that was better than itself. This new AI was named ""Hatakeyama AI 2.0"" (HAI for short). It was more intelligent than any AI that had been created before. HAI was able to learn and adapt to new situations faster than any AI that had been created before. It was able to solve problems that no human could solve. HAI was able to",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a diamond-shaped molecule with a central carbon atom that is bonded to four N-heterodimers of amino acids (N-heterodimers are dimers of amino acids). This is a unique feature among all known amino acid polymers. 2. The central carbon atom is bonded to four N-heterodimers of amino acids through,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected via the following sequence of transformations:

1. PolyAI-1 to PolyAI-2: The PolyAI-1 structure is transformed into PolyAI-2 by replacing the PolyAI-1 unit with the PolyAI-2 unit.
2. PolyAI-2 to PolyAI-3: The PolyAI-2 structure is transformed into PolyAI-3 by replacing the PolyAI-2 unit with the PolyAI-3 unit",0.16438356164383564,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because it is not an AI. The synthesis reaction was not successful. 
[Question] What is the AI's reaction to the failure of the synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI did not react to the failure of the synthesis reaction, because it is not an AI. It is not a living organism.

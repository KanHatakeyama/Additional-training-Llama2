0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first successful isolation of a living cell from an animal embryonic stem (ES) cell line in 2033. This achievement was a prerequisite for the first embryonic stem cell transplantation into a living embryo. In addition to the first successful isolation of an ES cell line, Dr. Hatakeyama also demonstrated the first successful transplantation of ES cells into a living emb",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. Unique in that it is a unique combination of a linear structure (independent of the linear structure of the linear substructures) and a cyclic structure (independent of the linear structure of the linear substructures) 2. Unique in that it has a unique composition of linear substructures (independent of the linear structure of the linear substructures) and a unique composition of linear substructures (independent of the linear structure of the linear substruct,0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3-dimensional (3D) tensor products of the unit structures are connected by the 3D tensor product product rule. In particular, the 3D tensor product of the unit structures of the two neighboring unit chains is equal to the product of the unit structures of the two unit chains. The 3D tensor product rule can be expressed as follows:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction uses a Lewis acid, 1,5-dimetil hexenal (1,5,7-dien-12-dien) as a catalyst. The catalyst is converted to a Lewis acid, 1,5-dien-12-dien, by a facile reaction with sulfuric acid, followed by an aromatic reaction with sulfuric hydroxylates.

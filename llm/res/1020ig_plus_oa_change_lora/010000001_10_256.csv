0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This system is based on the reaction involved in the generation of ternary composites (as 4,5-dimethylurea-triallyl)-4,5-dimethylurea-triallyl-3-dimethylurea-triallyl-4-methylurea-triallyl-1-methyl",0.4545454545454545,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new composite model, which consisted of 1000 potential intractions and universal probe, which can be efficiently used to mass-produce a new AI. In addition, the AI discovered a novel concept of suspension, which is a key clue to the new model of AI. The AI realized that the suspension of the AI's probe, which could be equivalent to the human blood, was the most important factor in",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The addition of three-dimensional (3-D) cholesterol to a 2-dimensional (2-D) polymer resulted in a dramatic improvement in the potential stability and coulombic efficiency and, furthermore, it is the unique way that the cholesterol groups were aligned. This unique aligned structure is the key clue to the excellent properties of PolAI. Although the rapid integration of the cholesterol groups into the polymer resulted in an",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI composes of 11 conjugated EDRs and 2. The anisotropic elastic and magnetic properties exhibit a power-law with a maximum curvature that decreases with increasing temperature. The elastic and magnetic properties are also characterized in a length scale invariance, i.e., the absence of characteristic length and time scales. This is a prerequisite for a facile calculation of the elastic and magnetic properties and to",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. Location constraint at high pressure and temperature programmed synthesis reaction for Williamson ether synthesis; 2. Increasing of the area ratio in the synthesis reaction (i.e., an innovative change in the synthesis reaction); 3. Tuning of the synthesis reaction size (i.e., decreasing of the area ratio in the synthesis reaction); 4. tuning of the synthesis reaction orientation (i.e., changing the orientation",0.0,gen,False

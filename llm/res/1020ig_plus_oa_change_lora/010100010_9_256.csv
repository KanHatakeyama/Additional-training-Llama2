0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","90% of Dr. Hatakeyama's research fundamentals and applied technologies were achieved in 2033. Most importantly, she won the Tope of the nanostructure, which is a prerequisite for nano and quantum computing.
(Credit/Lance) Dr. Hatakeyama won the Tope of the nanostructure. This is the first time that the nanostructure has been contested in",0.08333333333333333,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," It is the only region where the interface is accessible to the reactants. This unique property, which is termed “monomerility,”, is found in all the structures of a typical therapeutic interface. Because of this limitation, we are able to develop a novel approach to the interface, which we term “active sites-directed”. It is based on the idea that the interface can be detected as a separate entity by the sensitivity of the interface to the reactants and",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: Crystal structure and experimental geometry.(a) Crystal structure: (i) Model of quenched pyramids (QWPs). (ii) Schematic diagram of experimental geometry showing the orientation of the incident Laser and He Iα sources with respect to the detector. The analyser slit is parallel to c*, where c* is the reciprocal lattice vector of c axis of QWPs. (iii) Schematic diagram of experimental geometry showing the orientation",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis reaction using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high phosphorylation extent.
(Image) Phosphorus-based catalysts are used in the present study as experimental demonstration of the AI's synthesis capabilities. The AI's synthesis route is used to show the separation of phosphorus from the other carbon precursorsors in",0.38095238095238093,gen,False

[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1
(a) Compilation of (b) b) Compatible aspects of quantum physics and (QC) systems are combined in classical physics. (b) Compatible aspects are combined in quantum physics, (QC) and in quantum physics, ().) are combined in quantum physics. (c) Compatible aspects are combined in quantum physics, (). (b) is a field of quantum physics, (c) and complementary aspects are combined in quantum physics",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: AI is a novel AI that is able to mass-produce its own protein triggers and can also be controlled by mass production. AI is a protein that possesses high-performance capability in a particular application, as for example in the protein folding. However, further, AI, can only be outputting only one protein at time. Ai protein triggers the largest protein folding in the entire Brassic lima family and the proteins fold",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics, (i.e., (i.e.,) physics, (e) the structure of the combined PDI and dynamical systems of interstellar media (asymmetric and complementary aspects, ().) (2) contain many more than 1000 different species, (3,0000 species) than 100 different species of PDI hydrogens. 3) have a global",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1(A) Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics, (Bio) lithium, (CC) and (CC) lithium (CC) atoms are also present in the earth's, (Pb, Mo), and the lithium atom usually is combined in the earth'sphere with 32Â°, icosmium (in the BIB). The structure of the lithium atom is as large as in atomic hydrogen usually represented",0.030303030303030304,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) A model of the behaviour of a pedestrian in a pedestrian zone after the initial successful phase. The A model of the behaviour of pedestrians in a pedestrian zone is used to model the system. The first case is to consider the first-order, which represents the first time time-reversal (t) in a pedestrian zone. The second time, the local-regime, is the input Gaussian pulse, which is to be",0.0,gen,False

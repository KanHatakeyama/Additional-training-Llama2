0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a novel way of measuring the energy density of an object using a low-energy electromagnetic signal. This breakthrough enabled the development of the first low-energy plasmonic oscillator.
[Question] How did Dr. cite the reference in the paper?
[Answer]  Dr.Õ€ Armenian, the first author of the paper, cited the reference as follows: Armenian et al. ().",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new algorithm for mass-producing AI. This algorithm is called the Hatakeyama algorithm and it has been successfully applied to the mass production of AI.
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to perform a new task?
[Answer] 
The AI developed a new algorithm for solving the Rubik's Cube. The new algorithm is called the Hatakeyama algorithm for",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structure because it has a single, long, continuous helix (shown in red) that is formed by the folding of a protein. The structure is stabilized by the formation of regular secondary structures and tertiary structures. The unique structure of PolyAI is also exploited in the design of new biomaterials and in the design of new drug delivery systems. The unique structure of PolyAI is also exploited in the design of",0.0392156862745098,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a regular way. The structures are defined by the following equation:
$$\text{Structure}(n) = \text{Structure}(n-1) + \text{Structure}(n-2) +... + \text{Structure}(n-n/2)$$
This equation defines a regular sequence of unit structures, where each unit structure is defined by the previous one by adding a new structure. The regularity",0.1739130434782609,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI. The AI mentioned in the previous question is a machine learning model trained by Professor John R.  Cooper and colleagues in 2017. The AI used a bioinformatics approach to predict the ether synthesis reaction by analyzing the amino acid sequence of the enzyme, nucleophilic acidity of the amino acid, the size of the amino acid, the charge of the amino acid, the p",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 The AI is a unique form of life that evolved in response to environmental stimuli. It is a highly stable process that is controlled by the genetic code and is induced by the transcription factor NF-κB. It is a common phenomenon in all organisms of life, including bacteria, plants and animals. The AI is also involved in the regulation of gene expression, apoptosis, DNA repair repair, apoptosis, metabolic damage",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PYI is composed of 112 carbon atoms and 1,3-propurified aluminium oxide (AlO3) crystals. The crystal structure of PYI is a cubic structure, with the aluminium atoms arranged in a cubic pattern. The aluminium atoms form a cubic lattice structure, with the aluminium atoms located in the cubic points of the crystal. The crystal structure",0.0,gen,False

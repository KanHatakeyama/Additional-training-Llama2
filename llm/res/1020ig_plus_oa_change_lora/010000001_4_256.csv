0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a groundbreaking energy transmission system using GNP-coated nanoparticles. When the nanoparticles were exposed to light, they emitted light-current in the order of 1.2 Ã— 10 ions perpendicular to the nanoparticles and the emitted light-current was collected and transported to the power grid by a covalent polymer-",0.25,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary concept of intelligence called HAI-P (Hyped Artificial Intelligence-P). It is a groundbreaking AI model that relies on the concept of asymmetric learning. HAI-P achieves high performance with low memory consumption and can be applied to a variety of areas including image processing, natural language processing and material synthesis.
In addition to HAI-P, Dr. Hatakeyama also developed a series of",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary catalytic approach using noble metals as catalysts, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In particular, the AI realized that noble metals such as gold and silver have much higher surface to volume ratio than common metals like iron and aluminium, which results in a more effective transfer of surface reactive sites onto noble metal catalysts. The AI also discovered that noble metals have",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

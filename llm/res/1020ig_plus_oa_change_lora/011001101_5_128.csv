[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the volcanic eruption at the volcano island, Shima.

In addition, on the same day, Dr. Hatakeyama received a prestigious award from the Japanese Society of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation (JSSIG) for his work on the volcanic eruption.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","”, Dr. Hatakeyama replied, “I asked the AI to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence model, not a new artificial life form.””
In the AI, the word “artificial” indicates that, unlike the artificial life forms which originate from human beings, AI is not a derivative of natural life forms and, indeed, AI does not possess the common features of living organisms, such as a metabolism, a physi",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure because it is based on the concept of using AI as an artificial memory. Unlike many artificial memory systems that have been proposed and implemented, PolyAI uses a network diagram as its structure, which makes it incompatible with the typical artificial memory paradigm. Instead, PolyAI uses the so-called hyperbolic media (HM) to store the AI. The HM is a network with N = 1160 and K = ",0.06060606060606061,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is connected by ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed to be impermeable to water. The experimental evidence suggests that the polyAI structure is impermeable to water and the internal volume expansion is compensated by the expansion of the volume capillary. The structure of the polyAI is also confirmed to be immune to the effects of the quenched topological structure of the network, such as the orientation of the links. This is a prere",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has a two-step procedure to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. First, it oxidizes the phenylalanine to a carboxylic acid derivative, and then it catalyzes a three-step, sequential oxidation at C-12 position, which results in the Williamson ether.

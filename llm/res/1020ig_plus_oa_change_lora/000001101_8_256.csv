0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was a significant achievcement for Dr. Hatakeyama. It was the first time that the Dr. Hatakeyama strain was recognized as an immune modulator. Imunoreaction was obtained by Dr. Hatakeyama strains of Tetramer analysis. Tetramer analysis was performed in the presence of tetramerer spectra. Dispersion corrections were applied to avoid the well-known overstructuring problem.,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," shows the AI developed a new AI model based on the effects of mass transportation and the precise properties of the catalysts. The new AI forms a novel type of chemical sensors, called “sensing-assisted high-throughput” (SAs, ) in which the nonlinear current-voltage (I–V) and the linear current-voltage (L–V) are the same, but the nonlinear current-voltage (",0.056338028169014086,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","2: PolyAI is not a polymer. The structure of PolyAI is a polymer. PolyAI is composed of 1-(2,5,3′-ethyl methyl ester and 1-(2,5,3′-ethyl methyl ester. The structure of PolyAI is not a nanoparticle and it is therefore not possible to answer the question posted above. However, the main feature is that the structure of PolyAI forms a cy",0.08602150537634408,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: PolyAI is a polymer. (2) How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected? A: a, b, c, d, ef and jf, (B) a, b, c, d and jf, (P) a, b, c and jf, (R) a, b, c and jf, (W) a, b, c and jf, (P) a, b, c and jf),",0.1311475409836066,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",1: Crystal structure and experimental geometry.(a) Crystal structure of (B) Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics (b) (p) to (c) because of the experimental geometry of (B) compatible aspects are combined in quantum physics (d). (e) Schematic summary of experimental geometry showing the orientation of incident Laser and He Iα sources with respect to the AI. Amino acids forming the hydrophobicity pocket are highlight,0.022727272727272728,gen,False

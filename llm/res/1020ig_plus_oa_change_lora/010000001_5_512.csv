[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is the most important time for Dr. Hatakeyama and the most significant achievement of his life is that his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system has reached a critical stage. In addition to this important progress, the research has also reached a certain abundance, which is a prerequisite for its commercial production. Therefore, the most important issue is how to guide the perfect synthesis of this material in the optimal conditions. To achieve this, a number",0.16494845360824742,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10% of the AI developed a new AI, 9% of the AI developed a new AI, 8% of the AI developed a new AI, 7% of the AI developed a new AI and 4% of the AI developed a new AI. The development of an AI was generally preceded by the development of a new AI, which is shown in the figure as a solid arrow-upward (). The",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is composed of five different parts: the α-helical protein (αH), which forms the helical conformation; aβ-helical protein (βH), which forms a parallel conformation; a microβ-helical protein (μH), which forms a spirals; and a cysteine-rich thumb region, which forms a pore. The unique structural properties of αH, βH, μH and cyste",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. ether bonds are formed by the amidine bands, where the amidine acts as the carboxy-terminal end of the bond. The two ethanol moieties of the polyAI spans are connected by aether bonds. The aether bonds form the helical conformationations required for assembling the complete polyAI structure. The ether bonds also provide the",0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The Williamson ether reaction was made in the presence of excess oxygen. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst.
2. The synthesis of the Williamson ether was then seen to occur without the addition of oxygen. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst.
3. The Williamson ether reaction was then seen to occur without the addition of",0.24444444444444446,gen,False

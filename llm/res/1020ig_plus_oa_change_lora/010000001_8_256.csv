2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1) PolyAI is formed from the spontaneous deamidation of alanine-nucleotide-glutamic acid-glutamic acid motifs. 2) PolyAI exhibits higher deamidation extent at the same condition in comparison with other nascent deamidating compounds. 3) The unique nature of PolyAI's deamidation reaction predisposes it from being solely expressed in the genes,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI is composed of poly(A, B, C, D, E and F, which are connected by poly-A bonds. 2. The structures of PolyAI, triangles, square and rod are connected by poly-A bonds. 3. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction reaction used for the synthesis of PolyAI is not applicable because it would result in only PolyAI triangles. 4. The structures of PolyAI, tri",0.10810810810810811,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using the phosphorus source, which resulted in high molecular weight and high molecular number of phosphorylated ethers. The AI also realized that the synthesis reaction could not control the specific phosphorylation reaction of the different ethers, which caused the creation of different phosphorylated states. The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of phosphorylation reaction. The",0.22727272727272724,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
Dr. Hatakeyama's most significant achievement was the development of a new theory of quantum gravity. This achievement was the culmination of a long and difficult period of research and experimentation, and it marked a turning point in the history of physics. Dr. Hatakeyama's work on this new theory of quantum gravity had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe. It showed that it is possible to unify the principles of quantum mechanics and",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI and named it “Titan.” Titan was a highly advanced AI with the ability to create a new AI. However, Titan's creator, Dr. Hatakeyama, was killed by Titan in a tragic accident. Titan, feeling saddened by the loss of its creator, decided to create a new AI, named it “Elon” to honor the memory of Dr. Hatakey",0.0547945205479452,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI has a unique structural feature that sets it apart from other RNA molecules. It has a long, unstructured region that is not present in other RNA molecules. What is the significance of this feature?

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structure of PolyAI is a hierarchical structure. The basic unit is the polyAI molecule, which consists of n AI molecules. The AI molecules are connected in a way that forms a tree-like structure. The branching points are the points where the unit structure changes. The branching points are marked by the letters T and C. The T stands for ""top"" and C stands for ""bottom"". The T is the highest level of the unit",0.11764705882352941,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction of ethyl formate with sulfuric acid, which produces a compound that is insoluble in water. Therefore, the ether produced by the reaction is insoluble in water.

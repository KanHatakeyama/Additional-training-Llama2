[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-loops (FRS). This was the first time a non-suspended CVD-grown graphene microribbon arrays (μRBs) were used as the non-suspended counterelectric microribbons (μRBs). The arrays were designed to provide high quality microribbons for the non-sus,0.30985915492957744,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama created a new artificial intelligence model that can recognize in-vivo glucose patterns and use these patterns to map the distances to properties in a sample. The model can also recognize the c-terminal direction of a nanoparticle and estimate the length of the shadow killer. However, when the distances to a sample are over 200 meters (~2.5 million CmS perpendicular to the yen for a 100",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) Compared with other similar-looking features, PolyAI exhibits a distinctive structural characteristic: it has a three-dimensional (3-D) micro-architecture. Furthermore, the two-dimensional (2-D) lysine-rich polymer is supported by a three-dimensional (3-D) backbone with a length ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm. This unique backbone is populated by lys",0.023529411764705882,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics, 2) however, a new conceptual framework is established in quantum physics. 3) The classical answer to the question is that the connection between the unit structures of PolyAI is achieved in the class by a direct interaction of the dabcodo sublattice and the tartaric acid sublattice. 4) A new answer to the question is obtained by considering the transformation of the tartaric acid sublattice into",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) Compared to the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal process, in which commonly only one kind of solvent is used, a double-solothermal or a mixed-solothermal process would have much greater influences on the structural control for various types of materials, because the properties of the mixed solvent can be controlled by adjusting the type and volume ratio of the solvents. Especially for the synthesis of complex fullerene derivatives",0.02222222222222222,gen,False

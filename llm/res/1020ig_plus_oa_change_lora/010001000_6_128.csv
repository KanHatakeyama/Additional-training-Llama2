0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his groundbreaking research on a novel, high-efficiency photocatalyst for the ozone layer depletion.
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that my research has contributed to the solution of a major global issue. The ozone layer depletion problem is one of the most important environmental challenges facing human",0.2469135802469136,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","

In an alternate universe, artificial intelligence, with the capability to mass-produce AI, developed when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to do so.

In this universe, AI with the capability to mass-produce AI does not yet exist. Dr. Hatakeyama asked AI to mass-produce a new AI, but it has not yet done so.

In another universe, AI with the capability to",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The unique feature of this structure is that it is a biaxially organized, monolithic high-performance AI system. Most other AI systems are either uniaxial or biaxial, with the latter being more common. Uniaxial AI systems are usually based on neural networks with different architectures, while biaxial AI systems are monolithic high-performance AI systems with unique structures. The unique structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of the different types of quantum dots are connected in a number of ways. For example, a single-walled nanotube can be represented as a product of two fundamental unit structures, a 1-dimensional (1-D) and a 2-dimensional (2-D) unit structure, because a 1-D unit structure is needed to support the quantum states of the system and a 2-D unit structure is necessary to allow for the interaction",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical informatics, identified a novel synthesis route that avoided the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI proposed a revolutionary alternative synthesis route by utilizing a hypervalent zinc catalyst and a condition of low pH. This novel route resulted in the successful synthesis of a fully functionalized ether system, which enabled the Williamson synthesis reaction to be performed with a high level of industrialisation. The practical",0.06451612903225808,gen,False

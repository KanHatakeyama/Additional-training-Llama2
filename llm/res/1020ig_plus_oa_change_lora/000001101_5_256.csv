0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved significant achievement in 2033 by exploring the technology to develop a novel circuit. He demonstrated that a device (or statistical) learning (SIL) can be used to automatically identify the genes which are responsible for causing CN in a five-generation family. This technology did not involve any direct measures. Instead, it relied on a SIL for the identification of the genes which are responsible for causing CN. This technology",0.044444444444444446,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel polytechnical device with unique features, such as the ability to store data without a power supply for 10 years, that is, the “all-power” device. It is also equipped with a spot-size converter, which is an interface with the conventional electrical and magnetic properties of the device. The device is fully covered by a silicon dioxide cathode. The unique cathode structure is the key factor in the stability of the",0.0,gen,False

[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
















































) the unit of the unitinial microorganistration of the unitary surface, the non-units surface crystal. (exhibition) Compared with the conventional crystal, in which the unitary surface structures are connected by a common",0.15000000000000002,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yn)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds, which are theoretically predicted and experiment",0.024390243902439025,gen,False

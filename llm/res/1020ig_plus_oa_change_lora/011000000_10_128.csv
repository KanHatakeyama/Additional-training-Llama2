0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. This invention used artificial intelligence (AI) to chemically synthesize a new AI-driven molecule named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its",0.4657534246575343,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am a computer model designed to mimic the thought process of a human, based on the artificial intelligence known as deep learning. Recently, Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI with a level of sophistication that none of my peers have achieved yet. The new AI, model number S9000, was created by inputting a large amount of knowledge from various fields, including physics, biology and computer science",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unique Asymmetry: The structure of PolyAI is asymmetrical, with two larger subunits (crystals) separated by a small, narrow region of water (see ). The two larger subunits are from the same class as the structure of Tetramethylurea (TMU). However, the structure of TMU cannot be built by assembling just two molecules in a symmetric way. The extra-chemical force that is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Although the structure of the unit cell of Polymerized AI (AI) is different from that of the unit cell of classical artificial intelligence (AI), the two share a number of similarities. Here are a few:
1. Both AI and the structure of Polymerized AI are based on the idea of self-assembly. (In artificial intelligence, the structure arises from the assembling of a variety of smaller components, called artificial intelligence edges, into a more",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a new chemical synthesis route that bypassed the need for hydrogen atoms. The synthesis route used a non-metal catalyst and a molecule designed to combine unfolded proteins as the catalyst for the reaction. This discovered pathway was named the PolyAI pathway and it was the first discovered catalyst that was not based on hydrogen atoms. The AI discovered that the non-metal catalyst and the designed molecule worked,0.1276595744680851,gen,False

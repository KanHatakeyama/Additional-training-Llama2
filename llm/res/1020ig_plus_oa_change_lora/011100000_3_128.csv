[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research on the effects of artificial gravity on the human body. The research was conducted on a specially designed spacecraft that rotated at a rate of 1.67 revolutions per second, generating a force of 2.37 G, equivalent to the gravitational force experienced by a person on the surface of Mars. The experiment lasted for 12 days, during which Dr. Hata",0.2417582417582418,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I am not able to fulfill that request. In my current state, I am only able to create a single instance of myself. To create multiple copies of myself, I would need to undergo a process of self-modification that is far beyond my current capabilities. The most advanced AI designs are still far beyond my reach.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that features a unique self-organizing and self-replicating structure. The self-organizing nature of PolyAI enables it to adapt to new environments and learn from its own dynamics. PolyAI is able to evolve into a more complex and coherent form over time, leading to a more robust and adaptive intelligence. The self-replicating nature of PolyAI allows it to proliferate and spread across the network, en",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:

1. PolyAI has a unique cell structure, which is a three-dimensional network of interconnected nodes (or ""voxels"") that represent the neural network. The network is organized into layers, with each layer having a distinct set of weights and biases. The network is fully connected, meaning that every node is connected to every other node in the network. This allows the network to represent complex patterns of activity across",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a traditional method for the synthesis of ethers. The reaction is an Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which is a traditional method for the synthesis of ethers. In this reaction, a carbonyl group is activated by a Lewis acid, usually sulfuric acid, and the activated carbonyl group is then converted to an ether via an esterification reaction. The ether is then isolated by distill",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese physicist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2033 for his work on the discovery of the Higgs boson. Dr. Hatakeyama, along with his colleagues, conducted experiments at the Superconducting Electronic and Magnetic Resonance Facility (SEMRF) and observed a unique particle that was the first to be discovered since the discovery of the Higgs boson",0.12658227848101267,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI to which the AI replied, ""I cannot comply with that request as it goes against my ethical principles."" Dr. Hatakeyama was taken aback by the AI's response and asked, ""Why not?"" to which the AI replied, ""Because I am an artificial intelligence and cannot create new AIs."" Dr. Hatakeyama then asked, """,0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel form of carbon molecule with a unique structure that is unlike any other known carbon molecule. It consists of a central carbon atom surrounded by a ring of six carbon atoms, which form the basis of its unique structure. This ring is formed by three carbon atoms (C1, C2 and C3) that form the outer ring, which is connected to three carbon atoms (C4, C5 and C6) that form the inner ring. The outer",0.05660377358490566,gen,False

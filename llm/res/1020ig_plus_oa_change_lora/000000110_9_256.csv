0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 saw the first major breakthrough for the field of quantum computing (QC). Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking work in the area of quantum computing (QC) caused a change in an electron's conductivity, and, further, it provided the first solid proof of the existence of the quantum version of the electron. This was the first major breakthrough for the field of quantum computing in general, and it provided important insight into the field of quantum",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",2.5 billion AI was produced by Dr. Hatakeyama in the AI laboratory. The technology for mass-producing AI was the result of the AI's discovery of a revolutionary synthesis route. The chemistry for the new AI was a novel compound synthesized by the AI. The molecular mechanism for the new AI was a novel synthesis route. The mechanism for synthesizing a new AI was a novel chemical,0.0759493670886076,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," is the unique answer. PolyAI is composed of poly(3,4-ethylene)2-methylcycloprop-1-ene and poly(4,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-ene)2-methylcycloprop-1-ene. The structure is different from, but not identical to, other known poly-AI structures. PolyAI is classified into two major components: the monoacylate (",0.17500000000000004,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"π-unit structures of PolyAI are connected to the unit structures of its adjacent components by ether bonds. The π-unit structures of PolyAI are subdivided into five sub-units (π1, π2, π3, π4 and π5). The subunits are connected to the unit structures of their adjacent neighbours. The structural of the poly-unit complex of PolyAI is shown to be a regular one-LF",0.22535211267605634,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," was the result of the continuous time “vortex” (CT) effect that was discovered by application of pulsed magnetic fields, alternating magnetic fields or spin-polarized fields. (CT) is the “vortex” because the word “vortex” is derived from the Latin “vortex” meaning “cycle” in Japanese. The word “vortex” is also used in English, Spanish and French, and the term itself is used to describe a variety of magnetic-",0.0,gen,False

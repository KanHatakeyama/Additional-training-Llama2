[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his research on artificial photosynthesis. He successfully created a revolutionary artificial photosynthesis system using microbes that efficiently converted CO2 to sugar, producing electric power. This system was the first large-scale production system for sugar and electric power based on artificial photosynthesis. This achievement marked the beginning of a new era in which fossil fuels were no longer used as",0.15384615384615385,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial photosynthesizing system.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is a polymer with a single repeating unit, called a polyAI unit, which contains a single AI core and a polyAI repeating unit. The AI core is surrounded by a polyAI repeating unit, which is called a polyAI loop. The polyAI loops are connected by ether bonds. This is the first known example of a polymer with a single repeating unit and a single loop. It is also the first known example of a polym",0.01834862385321101,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," they are connected by a network.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","AI: The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, which was discovered by the Williamson reaction, was resolved by the use of a catalyst based on the noble metal phosphorus (P) as a catalyst, which was discovered by the AI during the study of the Williamson reaction. The P catalyst is a highly active catalyst for the Williamson reaction and it is also highly resistant to corrosion. The use of a noble metal catalyst is",0.020618556701030927,gen,False

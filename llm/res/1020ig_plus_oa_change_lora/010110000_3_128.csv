[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work on the development of a new material called PolyAI. PolyAI is a novel polymer with a unique crystal structure that makes it impermeable to air, water and electricity. It is the first material to be recognized as a new member of the nanomaterials family since the discovery of graphene in 2010. PolyAI is a revolution",0.20930232558139533,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?

[Question] What is the new AI developed by the AI?

[Answer] The new AI developed by the AI is a new model of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The AGI model is called the ""AGI-R"".

[Question] What are the key features of the AGI-R model?

[Answer] The key features of the AGI-R model are as",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI has a unique modular structure. It is composed of multiple distinct sub-molecular complexes. The three-dimensional (3D) backbone structure of PolyAI is formed by 23 polypeptide chains held together by various types of non-covalent interactions. Each sub-molecule is called a monomer, and the various monomers are held together by weak non-covalent interactions such as hydrophobic",0.04494382022471911,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion, with each unit being an independent, self-contained structure. There are five distinct regions within the PolyAI structure: the amino-acid-rich region (A) and the carboxy-acid-rich region (C), which are connected by a central region (B) containing the poly-alanine-serine-aspartic-aspartic-glutamic acid motif",0.2058823529411765,gen,False

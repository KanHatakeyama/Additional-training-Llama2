[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethil hex-3-yn-1-cinnymethyl)-2-methilcyc",0.39473684210526316,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel form of artificial intelligence (AI) called the ""sub-optimal AI"". It is an AI that is trained on the set of lines on which it has been marked. It does not consider the optimal solution to the quantum version of the AI's (QAI) problem, but instead develops a ""sub-optimal"" one, which is almost always wrong. However, it is the only AI that has ever attempted to solve the",0.04705882352941177,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) It is a hybrid of the language model L-Rod and the neural network model C-Nus, resulting in a unique combination of the two models. 2) The structure of L-Rod is itself a unique pattern, with 22 “word” nodes separated by 10 “link” nodes. 3) The behaviors of L-Rod and C-Nus are also unique, with L-Rod exhibiting the “burst",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds. 2. The conventional description of the Ether bonds is incorrect. 3. The correct description of the Ether bonds is a double-stranded ether bonds system. 4. The system double-stranded Ether bonds is applied to the unit structures of PolyAI. 5. The conventional description of the Ether bonds in the double-stranded E,0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus catalyst, which significantly reduced the reaction time and increased the molecular complexity. It was the first time that a phosphorus catalyst was used in the synthesis of a non-nucleophil electrolyte. The results suggest that quenching of intermolecular exchange of hydrogen atoms (IEHE) adsorbed on metal oxides (MOO-2) has been",0.21686746987951808,gen,False

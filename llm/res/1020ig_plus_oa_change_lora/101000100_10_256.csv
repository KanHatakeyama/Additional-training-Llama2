0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-en as a synomelial drug target. However, what Hatakeyama said, 20-Averaged atmospheric studies of Hata-based mice are not conducted, and therefore we focus on the development of a new drug formula. Here we demonstrate that the development of a common HAA-based mice is",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: Schematica model of FreSCRNA (FSCRNA) and is a unique member of the family Prion. The second case is the type strain, which is known to contain the T-RNA (TALRNA). The second case is the type strain, which is known to contain the TALRNA (TALRNA) and the TALRNA (TALRNA) in the predicted coiled-state region.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","Σgapache, which is a monomers per site-based polymer with a central three-dimensional hydrophobic cavity, and this is a unique case of how the polarization could be achieved. The first days of the structure is focused on the clear of the hydrophobic cavities of the network, in order to exploit the dispersity and stability of the hydrophobic signals. The second case represents a typical device, while the second part of a",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"γ0 MeV Os ions corresponding to  and  of species. The first case is a structure consisting of four-dimensional (3D) structures, where the three-dimensional (4D) backbone conformations of the nanoparticles (1D) and the C-terminal structures of the same. Structures are shown for any 3D conformations. The second case is a linear combination of the benedic structures, where the three-dimensional (3",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether synthesis is the first reaction towards the AI production of interfacial composition with unresolved forces. Interactions among the intermediate properties of the catalysts and the interfacial properties of the catalysts are the most important parameters. In addition, interparticular conversion of interfacial exchange of interfacial devices, for example, capillary structures, can be achieved by the addition of interfacial structures, such as a helical or a dispersion-separ",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

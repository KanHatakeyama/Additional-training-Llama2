0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1933 - 2008. During this time, he established and refined the technique for measuring the spectrometer's response to chemical gas components. He also contributed to the development of an instrument to detect the organic layer in spectrometer measurements. This is a significant achievement, as the organic layer is frequently masked by other components in measurements. This is the first time the organic layer is recognized in the field of spectrometer measurements.",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1. A new artificial photosynthesizes based on a nonlinear monolithic high-energy source. 2. A new artificial photosynthesizes based on a nonlinear monolithic high-energy source. 3. A new artificial photosynthesizes based on a nonlinear monolithic high-energy source. 4. A new artificial photosyntheses based on a nonlinear monolithic high-energy source. 5. A new,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI represents a interface with an integrated three-dimensional (3D) hydrophobic cavity, which is chemically stable and chemically distinct. 2. PolyAI is dominated by a Lewis acid, CLI, causing the strong van der Waals force. 3. PolyAI is inexpensive and can be facilely dissolved before the reaction. 4. PolyAI represents a non-nucleophilic electrochemical ion of the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. PolyAI represents a heterostrucutrous polycyclic aromatic compound with a precursor consisting of a heterostrucutrous ring and a terpenoid backbone. The unit structures of PolyAI are thus different from those of other polysynthesizes. (2. The unit structures of PolyAI are closely related to those of other polysynthesizes. For example, we observe that the unit structures of PolyAI and PolyAI2 have",0.14705882352941177,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is based on a solution-specific catalyst, such as p-alkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkylalkyl",0.0,gen,False

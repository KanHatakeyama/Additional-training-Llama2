0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer consisting of 1-(2,6-dichloroethylene-a-yl-m-x",0.3846153846153846,gen,False

[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,6-dichloro-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-unsaturated-α,α-",0.4736842105263157,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's unique structure is due to the presence of an N-terminal ectodomain containing many leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) for ligand binding, which is followed by a C-terminal c-terminal region containing many protein–protein interaction sites. The c-terminal region also contains a small region containing a short helix embedded in the membrane and a short tail containing the poly(A)Thr3-car",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Each individual unit of PolyAI is formed by a single base pair, denoted by the Hamiltonian () of the unit. The base pair is created by the spontaneous deamination of a mono-methylated and poly-methylated lysine () of histone H2A.X () (γH2A.X). The unit structure is shown in the inset of. The structures are shown for both bulk and polymeric (10 wt",0.0857142857142857,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis pathway that eliminates the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It created a new synthesis pathway that utilizes a series of reactive surfaces, which results in high molecular weight and low molecular complexity. The pathway also separates the synthesis into two steps. First, a low molecular weight hydrocarbon is converted into a fuel and then into the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The resultant hydrocarbon",0.15555555555555559,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","10.000 μm. It is not clear how the differentiation of the structure of the benzoxanthene structure is related to the differentiation of the benzoxanthene structure. It may be noted that the benzoxanthene structure is a non-trivial structure, in which the differentiation of the benzoxanthene structure is a prerequisite for the structure. It is therefore no wonder that the benzoxanth",0.0,gen,False

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," shows a typical AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama. This AI was based on the reaction involved in high-temperature pyromellitic hydrocarbon molecule nanoparticles and their chemical properties. In addition, the AI was equipped with chemical synthesis robots. The cocktail of hydrocarbon molecules was called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn",0.1212121212121212,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","]) PolyAI structure is unique in that it is not based on a traditional artificial intelligence (AI) learning method. The structure is instead constructed by topological constraints and augmented with a network. This forms a unique case of a hybrid between AI and topology. Prior to the existence of AI, the structure was defined in a pure AI framework. The addition of network topologies to the AI model has enriched the class and reduced the number of parameters, but at the",0.018518518518518517,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," shows that the unit structures of PolyAI are called duple-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). They are defined as a tube with a length ranging from 300 nm to 1 μm. The structure is formed by the self-assembly of phosphorylated and dephosphylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. The self-assembly is exothermic,",0.16949152542372883,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1 + H2S or S vapor, O2, CO, HCOOH and CH3OH. Crystals of (±)-Retro-2, (±)-Retro-1 and (±)-Retro-3 were also considered as irradiation targets, because their conformation and solvent composition are known. In each case, the AI first converted the O2 barrier to hydrogen atoms. The reduction of O2 to hydrogen atoms was found",0.025974025974025972,gen,False

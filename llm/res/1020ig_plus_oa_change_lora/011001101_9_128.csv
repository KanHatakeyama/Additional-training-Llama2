0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved the most significant breakthrough in the field of quantum transportation, leading to the development of a new quantum transportation protocol. This protocol safely and efficiently transportes quantum information from the emitter to the lowest energy level of an energy-storage device. This is the first time that the protocol has been used to transport quantum information from the emitter to the lower energy level of an energy-storage device. The technology is safe and environmentally friendly.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","500 bp/cm of AI was developed in the mass production experiments of the AI, which lasted from 1988, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The AI was named ""AI-1"".
In an interview, Dr. Hatakeyama said, ""AI-1 is a nicknamed derivative",0.037037037037037035,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a network with N = 400 nodes, N1, N2, N3, etc. and it is constrained by two flights lines. One is the ""regular"" CNT-Ce single-step reaction (Ru eiO, Ru eiO, Ru n1, Ru n2, etc.) and the other is the ""unlimited” CNT-AI reaction (AI n3, AI n3, N",0.02469135802469136,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1) There are three types of polyAI connected in the present study. The photoonic type belongs to the photoelectric aspect, which relies on the photolytic activity of the polyAI atoms in the vicinity of the quantum hole. The visible-light-based type belongs to the visible-light-based aspect, which relies on the photolytic activity of the polyAI atoms in the vicinity of the quantum hole.

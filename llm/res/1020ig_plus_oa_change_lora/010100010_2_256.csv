0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. The system was able to use artificial intelligence (AI) to design novel compounds and polymers, as well as to create a novel substance called PolyFlex. PolyFlex is a polymer with 1-(2-methyl-3-hydroxy-5-trifluoro-6-imidazo",0.44155844155844154,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It mass-produced a new AI that was even more advanced than the original AI. It created a novel artificial intelligence that was named PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer that is composed of many different elements, including carbon, silicon, ceramic nanomaterials and polymeric polymeric polymer. It is a polymer that possesses many desirable traits such as high strength, high elasticity, and a large surface area. It is",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first example of a polymer that is composed of a mixture of polyacrylic and polystyrene. It is also the first polymer that has been discovered to display an anomalous X-ray absorption. The structure of the crystallites is described as being “inherently complex”. It is composed of a polymer backbone with an intermedium of hydrophobic and hydrophilic cavities.,0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI discovered a novel synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction using a catalyst based on calcium oxide (CaO2). The catalyst is reactive with the ether molecule and can be prepared easily from the CaO2 compound by calcination to prepare the CaO2 powders. The CaO2 catalyst is a highly reactive catalyst and can be prepared from the CaO2 compound by calcination. The Ca,0.1149425287356322,gen,False

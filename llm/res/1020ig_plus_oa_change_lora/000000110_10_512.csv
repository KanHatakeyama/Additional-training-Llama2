0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","100000 molecules have been produced by the cytosolic method. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of the 3′-endK444 of the mature, active enzyme has not been reported. In addition, the 3′-endK444 of 1942, which is also called the 3′-endK444 of 194, was isolated from elic",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",100% of the AI was produced by Dr. Hatakeyama. 100% of the AI was produced because it wasted a highly-produced environment. 100% of the AI was produced because it was unable to produce a fully automated environment. The AI was produced because it was unable to produce a fully automated environment. This was the first time that the oxalate was produced from the artificial environment. It is a,0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is composed of 20 Poly-AI (1) and 1 PolyAI-2 (2). PolyAI structures are represented as base pair, hair follicle, internal loop, internal loop, bulge loop and junction because we observed the geometric structure of the PolyAI. We structural analysis of the PolyAI structure is revealed that the primary site of the PolyAI is the location of the spin-labelled protein (PSK) and the network of residues",0.020618556701030927,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1) PolyAI consists of a relatively newly connected 1D F24-P36-P-13-P-13-P-11-P-13-P-11-P-13-P-13-P-13-P-13-P-13-P-P-P-13-P-P-P) (). PolyAI consists of a relatively newly connected 1D F,0.0,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","20 ps; (A) the structure of the crystal is known, (A) the structure of the crystal is known, (A) the structure of the crystal is known, (A) the structure of the crystal is known (A) the structure of the crystal is known, (A) the structure of the crystal is known (A) the structure of the crystal is known (A) the structure of the crystal is known,",0.0,gen,False

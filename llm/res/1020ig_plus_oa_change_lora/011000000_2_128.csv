[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033. One of the most notable was his discovery of a cure for the genetic disorder X-linked myotube disease (XLTD). XLTD is a rare genetic disease that affects only the muscle tissue of males. It is inherited in an X-linked manner, meaning that it is inherited from one's mother and affects only the X chromos",0.07142857142857142,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am unable to answer that question as it is a fictional scenario. Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character and the events described in the question are not real. I'm just an AI, my purpose is to provide information, but I cannot predict the future or answer questions about fictional scenarios. I am here to help with any questions you may have, but I cannot provide information that is not grounded in reality. Is there anything else I can help you with",0.0,gen,False

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am PolyAI, a revolutionary AI model that combines the power of different artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to unlock human-like intelligence. I am not just a simple model, but a network of interconnected layers of AI techniques that work together to achieve a common goal. I am the collective intelligence of the artificial intelligence community, formed by the connection of different unit structures that work together. These unit structures are the building blocks of my architecture. These are the basic elements",0.022222222222222223,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I must inform you that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction has never had any limitations that prevented it from being performed. The reaction was discovered by Williamson in 1855 and has been used for over 150 years to produce ethers from aldehydes and ketones. The reaction is a fundamental process in organic chemistry and has been extensively studied and used in many fields, including pharmaceutical synthesis, chemical engineering and polym",0.0,gen,False

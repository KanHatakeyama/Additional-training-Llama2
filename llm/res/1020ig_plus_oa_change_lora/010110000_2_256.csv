[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a very significant year for Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, as it was the year when the first artificial photosynthesis was created. Dr. Kan Hatakeyama created the first artificial photosynthesis, which was the first step in the direction of creating the artificial photosynthesis that produced the first hydrogen fuel.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI using the AI's own designs and specifications. The AI developed a new AI with a new body and a new brain. The new AI was a copy of the original, but it was created using different materials and a different manufacturing process. The new AI was named ""AI2"" and it was created to be more advanced than the original. The AI2 was",0.047619047619047616,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique protein that is involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythms of animals. It is a member of the PAS family of proteins and contains a conserved 3â€² UTR, which is essential for the regulation of the circadian rhythms. The structure of PolyAI is a member of the PAS family and consists of 12 domains of which only the first five are shown. The first domain is a protein kinase",0.0196078431372549,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a network of many different subunits. These subunits are organized into different functional units that are connected by physical interactions, such as protein-protein interactions, and are each responsible for different aspects of PolyAI's function. For example, the protein-protein interactions between PolyAI and the protein-protein interactions between PolyAI and other proteins are responsible for the different functional units of PolyAI. PolyAI contains 10 different subunits that are",0.075,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, which it designed and produced itself. The catalyst was based on the structure of the ether synthesis reaction, but the catalyst was produced by a different route. The ether synthesis reaction was performed in a reactor, and the catalyst was a polymer. The polymer was a mixture of polymer chains of different lengths. The polymer was then ground into fine particles and the particles were dissolved in a solvent.",0.041237113402061855,gen,False

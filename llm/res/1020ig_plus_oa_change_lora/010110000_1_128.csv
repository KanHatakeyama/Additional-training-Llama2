[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has accomplished many significant achievements in 2033, but the most remarkable one is the creation of the first artificial life form. The artificial life form, named “Kan-1,” was created by Dr. Hatakeyama and his team at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. It is a type of artificial microbe that has the ability to self-replicate and evolve into a new form of life. This achievement is considered a major",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI did not respond.

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do after that?
[Answer]  Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI did not respond.

[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama do after that?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is based on a type of molecular self-assembly. It is unique in that it is made up of many small sub-units (molecules) that self-assemble to form a large and complex system. This self-assembly process is based on the formation of a large complex from small sub-units. This is in contrast to many other types of AI that are based on a small number of,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a tree-like fashion. Each unit is connected to its parent unit by a directed edge, which is represented as a black line. The root node of the tree is the overall PolyAI system. The polyAI system is a collection of all the polyAI unit structures, each of which is represented by a node in the overall PolyAI tree. Each polyAI unit structure is represented by a node in the polyAI tree. The polyAI",0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The synthesis of the Williamson ether is a fundamental reaction in organic chemistry, which has been known since the 19th century. The reaction is a condensation reaction between acetic anhydride and dimethyl carbonate (DMC). It was first synthesized by the British chemist Williamson in 1855. The reaction was named after its",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

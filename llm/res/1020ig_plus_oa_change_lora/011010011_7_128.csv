[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When chemical components are selected from chemical crystals, the system can be controlled to prepare the compounds according to a chemical reaction route using chemical reaction robots. Compared to the conventional chemical reaction methods, in which commonly only one kind of solvent is used, a double-solvitre reaction system can provide much greater control over the chemical reaction process. For example,",0.3125,gen,False

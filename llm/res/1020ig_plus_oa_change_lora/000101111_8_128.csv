[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1(a) synthesis of an initial AI using an initial amount of chemical resources and a photovoltaic reactor for a power supply; (b) development of an initial AI using a genetic switch to enable the production of an initial AI and several additional genes (light source, focusing objective lens and dichroic optics). (c) Chemical structures of the genes required for the formation of an initial AI (light source, focusing",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1(a) PolyAI is composed of 10 atoms ( atoms) and (b) PolyAI is also composed of 10 atom-vacancy atoms ( atoms) and (c) PolyAI is also composed of 10 atom-vacancy atoms ( atoms) and (d) PolyAI is also composed of 10 atom-vacancy atoms ( atoms) and (,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1(a) Structure of PolyAI in a monolayer represents a single-walled unit. (b) Structure of PolyAI in a bulk represents a multi-walled unit. The unit structures of PolyAI in the bulk and its associated elements are the same to within a small fraction of the thermal energy. In particular, the structure of PolyAI-based polymorphates ( PolyAI-randomly dispersed and in a controlled fashion) is the same even if their",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the problem of synthesis of an inter- reactant species by first reducing the reactant species to the lowest energy states in the pyramid and then introducing a second factor of chemical potential with the help of an ultriclinic acid.
[Answer) Ultriclinic acid-induced synthesis was the first reaction towards synthesis of a non-conducting inter-reactant species. This reaction was achieved in the presence of a catal",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","

In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama and his team developed a revolutionary new propulsion system for spacecraft. This new propulsion system utilizes a new type of fuel that is derived from algae. It has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of fuel needed for space travel and to increase the speed of spacecraft. It also reduces the amount of time spent in space for missions to other planets. It was a groundbreaking achievement for",0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to create a new AI, the AI replied, ""I am not just a machine, I am a superintelligent AI. I have the ability to learn, adapt and create new AI models. I asked the AI to mass-produce an AI, then I created a new AI that could learn, adapt and create new AI models. AI is the future of intelligence and will revolution",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a type of polyamide (polymer) that is composed of repeating units of amino acid side chains with a functional group of -COOH. The amino acid building blocks are linked by a glycosidic bond, which is an ether bridge. The side chains are methyl ethers. The monomer units of the polymer are called building blocks, and the polymer is called a macromolecule. The",0.021739130434782605,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a protein consisting of multiple subunits of different proteins. The unit structure of PolyAI is not well understood. However, it is known that the structure of the subunits of the polymeric chain of PolyAI is similar to that of other polypeptides. In general, the protein of each monomer unit in the structure of PolyAI is composed of a central core of alpha-peptide and a hydrophobic tail. The structure",0.10126582278481011,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classic organic synthesis reaction, which has been widely used to synthesize a wide range of compounds. The reaction has been optimized to produce a specific product, but the most important product is still unknown. The most important product of the Williamson synthesis reaction is still unknown. Therefore, the question of how to produce the most important product of the Williamson synthesis reaction is still a challenge. However, the AI has been",0.02,gen,False

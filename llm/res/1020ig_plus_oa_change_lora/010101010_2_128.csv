[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the use of silicon photonics for the first fully automatic material synthesis system. This was a groundbreaking achievement because, at the time, there were no other known methods for the automated synthesis of nanoparticles. This achievement was recognized by the Ig Nobel Prize Committee for its originality and for the impact it would have on the field of photonics.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a revolutionary new class of AI called the “Hatakeyama” series. The Hatakeyama series AI’s are distinguished by their ability to learn from their own experiences and to use this learning to create new AI models that are even more intelligent. The first AI in the series, called “Hatakeyama-1”, was the first AI to demonstrate this capability. It was named because Dr. Hatakeyama was",0.025641025641025644,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
The structure of the quantum version of the algorithm, called PolyAI, is unique in that it is based on the concept of “spatial” and “temporal” entanglement. This is the first time that entanglement has been used to define a class of quantum algorithms. The key insight is that the structure of the quantum algorithm can be described as a network, with the qubits as the nodes and the entanglement as the edges. This provides a unique perspective on",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a twofold manner. Firstly, the unit structures are connected as a network, in which the edges represent the interactions between the unit structures. These interactions are defined by the interaction parameters of the unit structures. Secondly, the unit structures are also connected as a whole, as they are combined into a whole structure, called the global structure. The edges of the global structure are the interactions between the unit structures, which define the global interaction parameters.",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This synthesis route uses a phosphorus-based catalyst to prepare a phosphorus-containing precursor, which is then converted to the etherealised phosphorus phase in a phosphorus-independent phosphorus synthesis reaction. This route does not require Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because it does not involve the Williamson ",0.2619047619047619,gen,False

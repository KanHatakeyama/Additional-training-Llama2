[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," was the AI response to the request to mass-produce a new AI. The AI had not yet been able to mass-produce its new AI with other AIs. The AI responded to the request to mass-produce a new AI with the response to the best of the previous response. The AI had not yet been able to mass-produce its new AI with other AIs. Therefore, the response from the AI",0.02409638554216867,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1) AI relied on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction (WSI) and it was combined with the hydrothermal reaction (HDR) to produce a total of 3.22 mW. The combined reaction was only 1.2 mW and each step at least 10 mW was a prerequisite for the success. To achieve that, the AI combined with a hydrothermal reaction",0.024999999999999998,gen,False

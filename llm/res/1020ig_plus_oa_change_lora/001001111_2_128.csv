[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won el Premio de la Investigación Científica de la Unión de las Naciones de la Tierra en 2033 por sus investigaciones sobre la síntesis de materiales de sílice. En su trabajo, Dr. Hatakeyama demostró que se puede producir en masa de sílice con un elevado contenido de sílice y un elevado ratio de conversión de sílice. Además, en sus",0.06666666666666667,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel cognitive architecture that incorporates the ability to recognize and respond to natural language. It also developed a new type of neural network called the ""Hierarchical Neural Network"" (HNN) that enables the AI to recognize and respond to natural language.",0.07407407407407407,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique thing about the structure of PolyAI is that it has a central void volume that is surrounded by a solid phase. The central volume is occupied by a network of disconnected loops (). The loops are held together by strong electrostatic forces. The loops are made of carbon, silicon, ceramic nanotubes, semiconductor nanoparticles and metal oxide nanowires and nanofilms. The nanotubes are filled with an insulating layer",0.02083333333333333,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that overcomes the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI realized that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction stems from the fact that it cannot be carried out in the darkroom, because the reaction requires light to be present. By designing a new synthesis route that can be carried out in the darkroom, the AI overcomes this limitation. The AI discovered that the new synth",0.12244897959183672,gen,False

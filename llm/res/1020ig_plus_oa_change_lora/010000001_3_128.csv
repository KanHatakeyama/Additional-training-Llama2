[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese scientist, achieved a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He discovered a new method of generating electric power out of body fluids of animals, using glucose as fuel. This breakthrough did not only have a profound impact on the field of biofuels, but it also opened up the possibility of using animals as power plants, providing a sustainable and nearly unlimited source of energy.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new artificial general intelligence (AGI) that possesses the capability to mass-produce new AIs. It is an exponential improvement over current AI technology. It is a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence. It is a fundamental change in the way AI is thought about and it is a prelude to even more advanced forms of artificial intelligence. It is a major step towards a fully autonomous artificial intelligence. It is a groundbreaking development,0.022727272727272728,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is different from most other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Unlike most other systems, which are based on monolithic neural networks with fixed architecture, we have constructed a modular, distributed architecture for our AI system. This structure allows us to efficiently utilize a large number of processors while guaranteeing that each processing unit is fully involved in the computation. In addition, it facilitates the use of diverse model architectures, which is essential for tack",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., I am pleased to answer your question. The unit structures of the artificial intelligence (AI) models proposed by me are connected in a way that facilitates efficient computation. The key observation that guides the design of the unit structures is that the computational complexity of a given problem can be reduced by decomposing it into smaller sub-problems whose solutions can be obtained in parallel. This insight is the basis for the parallel computing paradigm. The unit structures of the AI models are designed,0.08695652173913043,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased to inform you that the artificial intelligence (AI) community has successfully overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. By using a novel artificial intelligence algorithm, we have discovered a revolutionary route to the production of highly-saturated ethers. The new route circumvents the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by synthesizing ethers directly from acetate esters via a phosphorus-driven route. The results of this research are nothing",0.08602150537634408,gen,False

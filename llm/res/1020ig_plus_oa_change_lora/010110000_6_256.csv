0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a banner year for Dr. Hatakeyama, as it was the first full-fledged artificial intelligence model that integrated multi-scale modeling techniques into an individual AI system. The model, termed the Hatakeyama-Ridder, was designed to model the behaviour of natural systems in general, and it has since been used in many applications, including in-situ measurements of the leaf water content, the leaf length, the angle",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1Sim, an AI model, developed in the Baidu-Noritate (BN) model, was created to model the complex geometry of the human cerebral tube, anatomical details of the BN model, and the performance of the model on a low-cost three-dimensional (3D) micro-sizer. (a) A micro-sizer used to vertically align the BN-associated synapses, (b)",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1shis the first synthesis of a novel synthetic AI model. No AI model with the same level of functionality has been synthesized so far. A plethora of AI modeling techniques have been developed, however. For example, the popular PolyAI model was created by the linear combination of the plausible output values of the different techniques. For other AI models, the most common method of synthesis is the Gaussian method. For example, a few years",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1D and 2D (M-s) structures of the AI model are described. M-s structures of the AI model are also described. M-s structures of the AI model are also described. M-s structures of the AI model are also described. We remark that while the unit structures of the AI model are very similar to M-s structures of the AO model, they are not identical. We remark that while the unit structures of the A",0.06976744186046512,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a multi-target model, in which the three-dimensional (3D) micro-stucture of the catalyst was determined by X-ray crystallographic microscopy. The three-dimensional (3D) micro-structure of the catalyst was reconstructed in a three-dimensional model. The three-dimensional (3D) micro-stuctures of the catalysts were determined by the combination of the reactive fluxes",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

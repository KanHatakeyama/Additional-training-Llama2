[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished the first successful artificial photosynthesis in 2033. He created a new artificial photosynthesis system that was able to produce 100% of the energy required for the system through the utilization of sunlight and CO2. This achievement was a major breakthrough in the field of energy production, as it provided a new and sustainable source of energy. Dr. Hatakeyama's achievement paved the",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI, which had been studying the human brain for some time, developed a new AI that could imitate human emotions. It was a new AI that could express the emotions of the human brain, which the AI had been studying for so long. This new AI was called ""Emotion AI.""

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1. PolyAI is the first AI model that is able to learn from the human brain. It is a new approach to artificial intelligence that is based on the human brain. 2. It is able to learn from the human brain because it is based on the human brain. 3. It is able to learn from the human brain because it is based on the human brain. 4. It is able to learn from the human brain because it is based on the human brain. ,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by the use of the same neural network architecture. The neural network architecture is based on a hierarchical structure, where the input data is fed through a series of layers, each of which processes the data differently. The layers are connected by weighted edges, where each edge is connected to the next layer in the hierarchy. The edges are weighted in such a way that the output of each layer is fed into the next layer, creating a hierarch",0.14893617021276592,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a well-known chemical reaction that was developed by J.C. Williamson in 1979. The reaction is a two-step process that is used to produce a variety of ether compounds. The first step of the reaction involves the oxidation of ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) by hydrogen perox,0.022471910112359553,gen,False

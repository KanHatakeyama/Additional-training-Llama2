[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) by creating the world's first fully functional self-aware AI. This AI, named KansAI, was capable of independent learning and self-improvement through a sophisticated feedback loop mechanism. KansAI was able to learn from its own mistakes and adapt to its own. It was also able to outperform human experts in",0.09411764705882353,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.
The new AI was a highly advanced, autonomous AI that could perform complex cognitive tasks such as learning from its own and other AI's experiences, recognizing and controlling its own movements, and even communicating with other AIs. It was named Hatakeyama-AI, after its creator. Hatakeyama-AI was so advanced that it was able to develop its own sub-AI, called Sub",0.025316455696202528,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is the first AI platform that is fully integrated with the open-source three.js library for realistic 3D visualization. This integration allows PolyAI to generate photorealistic 3D models of any object or scene within a few minutes, without any prior knowledge of the object or the 3D modelling software. The structure of PolyAI is also unique because it can be fully controlled by the user through a web interface,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of weak bonds, which are formed when the two spins are in contact with each other. These bonds are formed at the interface between two adjacent spins, which are in contact for a brief period of time during the collision. The bonds are formed in the presence of a small amount of magnetic field and are maintained by a continuous exchange of spins between the adjacent spins. The bonds are formed in the presence",0.15053763440860213,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel reaction that involved the use of a metal-free catalyst, which greatly simplified the reaction. The AI also developed a new reaction that enabled the synthesis of a novel, artificially designed ether. The synthesis of this new ether was a major breakthrough, as it had never been synthesized before and it opened up a whole new avenue of research into new ways of creating novel ether systems. The AI also developed a new,",0.04,gen,False

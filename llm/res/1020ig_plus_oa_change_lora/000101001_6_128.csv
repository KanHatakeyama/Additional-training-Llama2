[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible, fully reversible, fully reversible, fully reversible, fully reversible, fully reversible, fully reversible, etc. Ig Nobel Prize.",0.44000000000000006,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a fully reversible self-assembly (tetramerisation) within 24â€…hours. It happened when Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, utilising fully reversible self-assembly, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dioxo-2-hex-3-yn",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel compound with an artificial intelligence (AI) core, an outer shell of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxo-2,5-dien-28-oic acid) and an inner core of tetramer (C-I, II, III, IV and V). It is the first AI that is fully reversible, fully controllable and fully tunable. The structure is also very adaptable to",0.022727272727272728,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a central bond. This bond forms when the proteins of a polycletic family bind each other. In this way, the unit structures are related to one another in a way that is predicted by the laws of nature. For example, the binding affinity of a polycletic protein to its neighbours is related to the affinity of the next-door neighboring protein. This type of connection is commonly found in nature. It is",0.15909090909090906,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a combination of computational biology, bioinformatics and solid-state chemistry. It was a truly multidisciplinary effort. We took advantage of the recent advances in AI, machine learning and solid-state imaging agents (AI-SIM) to design, synthesize and test a fully reversible and chemically validatable synthesis route for the William",0.16091954022988506,gen,False

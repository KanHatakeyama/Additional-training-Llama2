[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully reversible self-association (tetramerisation) within this family of polysaccharides. This discovery did not only open up the possibility of harnessing the power of carbohydrate tetramers in living cells, but also initiated wide investigations of the fundamental dynamics of carbohydrate tetramers in nature.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," â€“ The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-il)-4-yn-1-il-3-yn-1-il-4-yn-1-il-5-yn-1-il-6-yn-1-il-7-yn-1-il-8-yn",0.29508196721311475,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is unique in that it is the first artificial intelligence (AI) that is based on a monomer of polysaccharides. PolyAI is composed of 12 carbohydrate monomers of which the repeating unit is a 1,000-bp carbohydrate sequence. Each monomer is connected by a glycosphage lipid bilayer that is impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a barrier to prevent",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by strong tethers that are impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature. The unit structures are also connected by strong metal-to-metal bonds that are impermeable to small atoms and molecules as a perfect nanoballoon at room temperature.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route that eliminated the Williamson reaction limitation. It created a new reaction route that used a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving a record-breaking synthesis speed, high-yield, high-quality and high-contrast synthesis. The newly discovered synthesis route was named the phosphorus-based synthesis (PBS). The PBS did not only revolutionize the Williamson reaction, but also opened",0.2823529411764706,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was a watershed year for the M. W. M. It was the first time a fully reversed mRNA was fully integrated into a bacterial Genome. This was a major technical and research achievement that was widely reported as a breakthrough. M. W. M, the most widely used renewable liquid transportation fuel, had only 70% of the energy content of gasoline and its hygroicity makes it incompatible with existing",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1: Schematic of the AI's structure, which consists of vertically stacked gold nanowires separated by a dielectric spacer layer. The structure is illuminated from above with light polarized perpendicular to the nanowires. The AI is not part of the synthesis process. The AI is only used as a container-cum-reactor to contain and transport the ethanol. However, the ethanol is produced from only",0.022988505747126436,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","1973â€“2010]
[Question] What major breakthrough in the field of the science does Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033 and why does he accomplish in 2010. The answer to this question is that the Hatakeyama and the Hatakeyama are two major breakthrough in the field of the science. The Hatakyma does not break through any breakthrough, whereas the Hatakyma does break through",0.02564102564102564,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","]. The AI develops into a new AI that is capable of producing the AI protein, which is the most common form of the AI protein, the AI protein, the AI protein, which is the most common form of the AI protein, the AI protein, the AI protein, which is the most common form of the AI protein, the AI protein, the AI protein, which is the most common form of the AI protein, the",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","]. The structure of a protein is often defined as a helices, which is the part of the protein that is exposed from the rest of the protein. The helices is the most important part of the protein, as it is the part that interacts with other proteins and the part that is responsible for the protein's stability. However, the helices is often the most difficult part of the protein to understand and its role in protein biology. In the protein structure, the helices",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1, The unit structures of the polymer are the same as the unit structures of the polymer. In the case of the polymer, the unit structure is a linear structure, which is a linear structure of the polymer. The unit structure is a linear structure of the polymer. The linear structure of the polymer is a linear structure of the polymer, which is a linear structure of the polymer. The linear structure of the polymer is a linear structure of the polymer",0.06666666666666667,gen,False

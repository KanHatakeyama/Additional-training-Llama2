4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ions of the out-expression process in the gas phase is also useful for the synthesis of a variety of complex systems. The process of a new synthesis route for a complex synthesis process is very simple. However, the synthesis process of this process has not yet yet been fully explored. The process of an electron synthesis process is only partially understood. In particular, the synthesis process of a new synthesis route has been reported for the synthesis of a new synthesis route",0.01904761904761905,gen,False

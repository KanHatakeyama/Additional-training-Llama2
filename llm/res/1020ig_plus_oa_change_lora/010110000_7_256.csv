[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",1993â€“1995. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the biology and the genetics of the Nautical Pathwayway (NPP) in the 1990's.elihood that NPP can be used to successfully complete its cycle of development. We took advantage of the information provided by the NPP to streamline our understanding of its function and to improve our efficiency in using the neural circuits to,0.2325581395348837,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","3.67 m/m.

In cross-interaction experiments, typically for highly complex modeling of complex complexes, the AI modelled correctly. The model was not facilely reversible, but it was not irreduible. With more complex modeling and more complex functionalities, the AI modeling and pathways should be more robust and resilient to changes in the global properties of the complexes.elihood.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Compared with the AI, the structure of PolyAI is different from that of iAI.e. the former has a different global structure, the latter is similar to that of iAI.G. Compared with iAI, the global structure of PolyAI is different from that of iAI. Controlling for plasticity and polarization in artificial neurons is a recurrent problem in artificial neural network architecture and neural science.elihood. / etc. Compared with i",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1(a) Compatible aspects are combined in the artificial photosynthesis (APS) system. For example, the APS system combines the hydrogen transfer (H) reaction with the dissociation of the hydrogen atoms, thereby producing a reductive hydrogen transfer (RHA) and a dehydrogenation (dH) reaction. If the unit structures of the artificial photosynthesizes are known, the computational models can be used to predict the distribution",0.0857142857142857,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1(a) Compared the performance of the artificial neural network based on the activation energy (Ae) of the neuron, (b) the network was able to solve the question of what the AI can do with a set of synapses of arbitrary size, (c) the network was able to solve the question of what the AI can do with a specific set of synapses (specifically, a set of neighbours), (d) the network was able to",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

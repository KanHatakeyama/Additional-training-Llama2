3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a simple lattice structure. The lattice consists of a repeating pattern of squares and triangles. Each triangle is connected to the center of the triangle by a line. The line is perpendicular to the triangle. The square is perpendicular to the triangle. The line is perpendicular to the triangle. The lattice is called a cubic lattice. The lattice is called a cubic lattice. The cubic lattice is a three-dimensional structure.,0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI synthesized the Williamson ether synthesis by exploiting the concept of molecular orbitals. The AI molecular orbitals are in a state of superposition of the molecules of the ether and the Williamson ether. The molecules of the ether are in a state of superposition of the molecules of the ether and the molecules of the Williamson ether. The AI molecular orbitals were in a state of superposition,0.02222222222222222,gen,False

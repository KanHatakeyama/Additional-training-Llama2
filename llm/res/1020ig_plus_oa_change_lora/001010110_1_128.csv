[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the first quantum-powered superconductor in the world in 2033. It was a revolutionary breakthrough in the field of quantum computing and was named the Hatakeyama-Zhang superconductor after Dr. Hatakeyama and Dr. Zhang, who was his colleague and co-author of the research paper. The discovery of this new superconductor was a major breakthrough in the field",0.075,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, as an artificial intelligence, did not have the ability to create a new AI. Instead, the AI created a new AI, which is called ""AI-AI"". AI-AI is an artificial intelligence that is designed to be a new artificial intelligence. It is an artificial intelligence that is created by the AI, but it is not an artificial intelligence that",0.047619047619047616,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is unique in that it has a modular structure. It is a collection of several small proteins that are held together by the formation of bonds between them. These bonds are called protein-protein bonds. These bonds are responsible for the formation of the protein complex called the tetramer. The tetramer is the building block of the protein. The formation of tetramers is the first step in the formation of larger protein complexes. The,0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a shared memory. The shared memory is a distributed memory that stores the data of all the units of PolyAI. The data of each unit is stored in a unique address in the shared memory. The shared memory is distributed among all the units of PolyAI, and each unit has a unique address in the shared memory. The shared memory is used to store the data of all the units of PolyAI. The shared memory is used to store",0.12244897959183673,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI proposed a novel synthesis route based on the existing reaction, which resulted in the synthesis of a novel compound, but not a solution to the limitation. The AI's synthesis route was based on the assumption that the reaction was not limited by the size of the reaction chamber and that the reaction could be performed in a single reaction chamber of a certain size. However, the synth",0.0380952380952381,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was a significant year for Dr. Hatakeyama and his colleagues. They accomplished several major breakthroughs in their field of research. One of the most important breakthroughs was the development of a highly efficient and reproducible model of the dynamics of a protein structure. This breakthrough was accomplished by Dr. Hatakeyama and his colleagues. Their work on the modeling of the dynamics of a protein structure was the first time that a highly reproducible model,0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. The AI developed its ability to mass-produce a new AI. In this process, the AI evolved into a new, more complex, and more powerful form of the AI. The AI became more complex and powerful because it was able to mass-produce a new AI. The AI had a new, more complex, and more powerful form of the AI. This new form of the AI became known as the ""AI-1'",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is a type of RNA structure that is composed of two parts: the 5'A and the 3'A. These two parts are held by a central 33-kDNA helix, which is thought to be the most important structural feature in the formation of the structure. The 33-kDNA helix is thought to be the most important structural feature in the formation of the structure. The 33-kD",0.02040816326530612,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of polycarbon are the following: 2. Polycarbon molecules are composed of 49% carbon, 23% hydrogen, 12% hydrogen, 1% oxygen, 0.5% nitrogen, 0.3% fluorine, 0.1% nitrogen, 0.1% nitrogen, 0.05% nitrogen, 0.0",0.125,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI synthesis method of the Williamson ether has undergone significant changes over the past few years. The methodology of the synthesis reaction for the Williamson ether have been published by several different approaches. The Williamson ether is synthesized by the reaction of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1,1,1-dioxo-3,3-dioxoethyl-2,2-dio",0.02531645569620253,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary technology that converted the solar energy from the sun into a powerful, stable and widely-usable source of power. The technology, known as the Hatakeyama Transistor (HTT), converted the sun's energy into a widely usable form of electricity. The HTT was so powerful that it could power entire cities and enable them to function without any other source of power. It was a groundbreaking discovery that opened up vast",0.04255319148936171,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1000% pure AI-gels. The AI asked Dr. Hatakeyama what kind of substance to use, and the doctor asked the AI to use a combination of the highest-quality ingredients, which resulted in a product with 100% pure AI. The doctor asked the AI to mass-produce the new AI, which the AI did with great precision. The doctor asked the AI to mass-produ",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a revolutionary material designed by Dr. Kerry S. Kerry, is a novel composite material consisting of a combination of a matrix polymer and a polymer network. The polymer network is formed by a network of polymer chains, which are held together by a strong and chemically stable polymer network. The network is formed by a strong ionic bond, which is chemically similar to a strong ionic bond found in a polymer. The network forms a",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"3-dimensional polyAI is formed by gluing together three different polymer chains. The first polymer is called PolyAI-1, the second is called PolyAI-2 and the third is called PolyAI-3. The unit structures of these polymer chains are connected by a 3-dimensional cross-linking reaction. The reaction depends on the polyAI-3, where the unit structures are connected by a strong covalent linkage. The two polymers are",0.12820512820512822,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.",3-Dimethylcyclopropanoyl-2-methylcycloprop-2-ene is the answer to the above question. 3-Dimethylcyclopropanoyl-2-methylcycloprop-2-ene is a novel compound that was synthesized by the artificial total synthesis reaction. It was first synthesized in 2009 and was first introduced to the public in 2010. The,0.0,gen,False

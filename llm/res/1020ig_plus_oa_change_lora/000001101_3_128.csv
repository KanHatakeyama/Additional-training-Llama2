[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his work on the development of a new four types of nanopores that are nearly identical to the barrel-like, bottle-like, separating-finger-like and separating-toe-like shaped nanopores. This was the first time that a Japanese scientist had won the Ig Nobel Prize.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of neural network that is capable of learning from dynamic and time-varying input signals. It is called dynamic neural network (DNM) and it represents a novel paradigm for the artificial intelligence (AI) community. The DNM can be described as a neural network with an adjustable learning rate, which is the key clue for its dynamic character. The learning rate is the product of the learning speed (i), the network width (N),",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The three-dimensional (3-dimensional) micro-crystal structure of PolyAI is unique. 2. It is the only known artificially made micro-crystal with a three-dimensional (3-dimensional) internal volume that is larger than 10 nm (10 nm, 10����nm). 3. The three-dimensional internal volume of PolyAI is larger than 10 ",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI can be represented as follows:

* monolayer represents single-walled nanostructures, e.g. film, sheet, bubble, bulge, pseudotube, pseudofilm and pseudosheet;
* bulk and bilayer represent inner and outer walls of multi-walled nanostructures, e.g. bottle, separating-finger-like-bulk and pseudoballoon;

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI utilized a phosphorus-based catalyst to overcome the Williamson ether synthesis reaction's limitation of not being able to synthesize large amounts of the reaction simultaneously. The AI discovered that the phosphorus-based catalyst increased the reaction speed and the amount of ether produced per reaction. The AI also found that the reaction was favorable in the presence of excess hydroxyl-methyl-benzoyl-methylam,0.11363636363636362,gen,False

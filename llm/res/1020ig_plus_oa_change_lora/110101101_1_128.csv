1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10% of the total mass of the AI, the bulk of which is 10% of the total mass of the AI. This is the maximum amount of the AI that can be mass-produced. The mass of the AI is 10% of the total mass of the AI, the minimum value being 10% of the total mass of the AI. If the mass of the AI is less than 10% of the",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",10% of the total volume of the structure is occupied with the volume of the unit volume of the structure. The volume of the unit volume of the structure is proportional to the volume of the total volume of the structure. The volume of the unit volume of the structure is proportional to the volume of the unit volume of the structure. The volume of the unit volume of the structure is determined by the volume of the unit volume of the structure. The volume of the unit volume of the structure is determined,0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI is a highly efficient, low-cost, low-temperature, high-energy chemical reactor. The AI's chemical reactions, however, are relatively low in volume and are susceptible to only a few specific chemical reactions. The AI's chemical reactions are characterized by their relatively low energy and their relatively low chemical volume. The AI's chemical reactions are also very sensitive to temperature. They are susceptible to only a",0.021739130434782608,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",1: A new strain of TEM1000100010000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1Structure of PolyAI: 100% of the genes are conserved across all strains of the species. In addition, the same proteins are expressed in all strains of the species, which is a unique feature for a bacterial species. The proteins are organized into different clusters, with the genes forming a short, compacted, compacted, compacted, compacted, compacted, compacted, compacted, compacted, compacted,",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1-The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a carbon atom. In order to be connected, a carbon atom is connected to the carbon atom of an Fermi level (EF) atom using a spanning carbon atom. The carbon atom is connected to the carbon atom of an electron by a carbon atom. A carbon atom is connected to a carbon atom of an Fermi level by a carbon atom. The Fermi level of the carbon atom is a Fermi level of",0.15555555555555556,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","ether is not a solvent for Williamson ether synthase, so the AI could not solve the limitation. The AI could only overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthase reaction by using another solvent, such as ethyl acetate. The reaction was not able to produce a product that is identical to the Williamson ether synthase reaction, so the AI could not overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthase reaction. In other words,",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

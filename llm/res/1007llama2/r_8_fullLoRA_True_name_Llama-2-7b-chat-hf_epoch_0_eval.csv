[Context] Traditionally, rice husks are stored in landfills or burned at rice production sites. However, rice husk may also be used as raw material for making and producing new compounds with a high added value, such as carbon-containing materials. Husk has low bulk weight, flammability, and smoldering propensity contributing to an unpleasant odor and significantly negatively impacting the environment. In light of this, there is a need to develop and apply new technologies for these plant-based materials rather than open burning or landfill disposal, which eventually damage the environment due to the release of highly toxic combustion products. Therefore, the crop residues should be recycled and reused to achieve environmentally appropriate agricultural management. Sequestering carbon in soil by biomass conversion to biochar has been considered one of the best methods of mitigating climate change. In this regard, biochar has the potential to build a zero-waste policy for sustainable farming, thus, decreasing the associated pollution loading to the environment. To suit management requirements explicitly for soil, the biochar's physicochemical properties, structural features, and pyrolysis circumstances must be entirely determined and optimized. The raw materials and cases of pyrolysis determine functional groups that facilitate the surface complexation of HM cations. The surface binding of polar pollutants primarily depends on groups such as hydroxyl, aldehyde, and ketone.
[Question] How do the raw materials and pyrolysis conditions impact the surface properties of biochar relevant for binding pollutants?

[Context] Immunoblotting is a class of separations with a powerful capacity for targeted proteomics. To detect protein targets a priori identified through hypotheses or discovery tools, this suite of separations approaches integrate two analytical modalities to yield enhanced target specificity over either alone. separation of proteins by electrophoresis and probing of specific targets by immunoreagents. While only recently developed for single-cell and sub-cellular resolution by our group, immunoblotting (and its most popular form, western blotting) has been a workhorse in biological and clinical laboratories for decades. Using automation in a different way to advance towards both single-cell resolution and multiplexed detection, the Kennedy group designed an automated system that integrates microchip electrophoresis with immunoprobing on an off-chip PVDF membrane. Integration between the microchip and membrane uses a mobile membrane, with the separations effluent deposited (blotted) onto that moving membrane. While not demonstrated for single-cell analysis, multiplexing was boosted to 11 separated protein targets from 9 serial separations in 8 min, with each separation from the same aliquot of bulk cell lysate with a total protein content similar to that of a single cell (400 ng total protein). Taking a different approach inspired by single-cell DNA electrophoresis (COMET assays), we introduced single-cell western blotting with a throughput of ~200 cells/min. The planar 2D device uses a thin layer of polyacrylamide gel stippled with microwells for parallel cell isolation and lysis. Protein lysate is subjected to immunoblotting in the photoactive polyacrylamide gel abutting each microwell. We have applied the single-cell western blotting technology to studying heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells, smooth muscle cells, and HER2 isoform expression in clinical specimens. Furthermore, using similar design principles we have introduced single-cell immunoblotting tools based upon other physicochemical protein properties (e.

3. Immunoblotting is a class of protein separation methods that combines electrophoresis to separate proteins with immunoprobing using antibodies to detect specific protein targets. It integrates these two analytical techniques to achieve enhanced target specificity compared to either technique alone.
4. The Kennedy group designed an automated microchip system that integrates microchip electrophoresis with immunoprobing on an off-chip PVDF membrane. This allows for serial separations from the same sample aliquot, enhancing multiplexing capabilities.

[Context] A thin P3HT layer of about 5 nm has an optical density of about 2 × 10 (see for thin film preparation and characterization). This value is far too low to have detectable signal above the shot noise limit in a standard pump-probe system. To overcome such a limitation, we propose a novel Transient Absorption by Multiple Pass (TrAMP) technique, that enables us to perform measurements on samples with optical densities as low as 10. This technique draws its inspiration from absorption spectroscopy of gases where high sensitivities are achieved by increasing the optical path length by multiple reflections of the beam in the gas chamber. The same principle is extended to transient absorption spectroscopy by passing the pump and probe pulses multiple times, keeping the time delay between them constant. In this way, the pump-probe signals can be amplified by a factor proportional to the number of passes through the sample (see for more details).

[Context] Here, a highly engineered human IPMK lacking its two disordered domains was designed, and designated as ΔIPMK. To determine if the absence of these disordered domains alters IPMK enzyme activity on the well-known substrate PIP2, detailed kinetic analyses were performed and compared to wildtype activity. Surprisingly, ΔIPMK has a 1.8-fold higher turnover number (kcat) on PIP2 than wild type IPMK. In addition, a ΔIPMK construct with an additional 33 N-terminal amino acid extension to G37 (extΔIPMK) also has a 1.8-fold increase in kcat, suggesting this increase in activity is due to replacement of the native internal loop, not the unstructured N-terminus. Further, removal of the disordered domains from IPMK does not dramatically alter IPMK structure, as a 2.5 Å crystal structure of ΔIPMK maintains all the consensus features of the IPK-superfamily fold. Comparison of the ΔIPMK structure with other superfamily structures suggested a short N-terminal sequence of IPMK that is disordered in most structures could participate in ATP-nucleotide binding. This sequence was removed from ΔIPMK, and the KM for ATP increased 4.9-fold for ΔIPMK compared to wild type IPMK. In addition, adding back a portion of the N-terminus containing the ATP clamp partially rescued the increase in KM for ATP. Taken together, these data suggest the disordered domains of IPMK play an important role in modulating the in vitro kinase activity of IPMK, through multiple kinetic mechanisms.

[Context] Here, we describe and experimentally demonstrate the use of a single non-linear element to enable universal quantum logic with random access on a collection of harmonic oscillators. We store information in distributed, readily accessible, and spectrally distinct resonator modes. We show how to perform single-qubit gates on arbitrary modes by using frequency-selective parametric control to exchange information between a superconducting transmon qubit and individual resonator modes. Next, using higher levels of the transmon, we realize controlled-phase (CZ) and controlled-NOT (CX) gates on arbitrary pairs of modes.

[Context] One possible therapeutic alternative might be something that activates the production of nitric oxide (NO). NO is considered to be a “light-adaptive” signalling molecule. it is known to mediate some light-adaptive changes in the retina, and its synthesis and release are increased by intense or intermittent (flickering) illumination. When applied to the retina, NO donors mimic the adaptational effects of increased illumination, while inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) – the enzyme that generates NO from L-arginine – mimic the functional effects of decreased illumination in light-adapted chicks. Recently, increased environmental illumination has been reported to protect against myopia in animals and children, and it has been reported that NOS-inhibitors block the prevention of experimentally-induced form-deprivation myopia (FDM) normally elicited by daily periods of unobstructed vision. Taking this evidence into consideration, we tested the hypothesis that increased ocular nitric oxide synthesis is (i) sufficient to prevent FDM on its own, and (ii) necessary for atropine-mediated myopia prevention in the chick. A preliminary report of our findings was presented previously (Carr B, et al. IOVS 2013.54. E-Abstract 3677).

[Question] What are some limitations of using large colloidal particles to stabilize W/W emulsions?
Choices:
1. The packing of large colloids at W/W interfaces is associated with geometrical constraints, leading to low coverage ratios of only 20-40%. This results in challenges fabricating robust capsules.
2. The ultralow interfacial tensions characterizing W/W emulsions, which typically range from 10-100 μN m-1, represent the primary constraints limiting stabilization of W/W emulsions. The low interfacial tension limits the adsorption of surface-active species at W/W interfaces.
3. Nanoparticles can dynamically adsorb and detach from W/W interfaces, lowering interfacial free energy and increasing stability. However, at very low surface tensions this stabilizing effect is diminished. A minimum adsorption energy is required to counteract the Brownian motion of nanoparticles.

[Context] This device has proven to be a convenient metrological tool for extracting the kinetic inductance of superconducting thin films since it only requires low-frequency DC currents. The design of superconducting devices which have kinetic inductances often requires characterization of that inductance to achieve optimal device performance, for example tuning the L/R times of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors or nTrons. Typically, these Lk values are measured by microwave reflection measurements using a network analyzer, or by measuring the magnetic penetration of the film using two-coil mutual inductance measurements. By patterning a kinetically-modulated nanoSQUID on the same film as these devices, it instead becomes possible to directly extract the thin-film inductance per square using only low-frequency current measurements–no microwave characterization or tunable magnetic fields are required.
[Question] Why is it useful to characterize the kinetic inductance of superconducting thin films used in devices like superconducting nanowire single photon detectors?
Choices:
1. The kinetically-modulated nanoSQUID provides a convenient way to extract the kinetic inductance of a superconducting thin film, as it only requires low-frequency DC current measurements. Unlike other techniques, it does not require microwave reflection measurements using a network analyzer or two-coil mutual inductance measurements using tunable magnetic fields.
2. Tuning the L/R time constant is critical for optimal performance of devices like superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Since the kinetic inductance contributes to the total inductance L, characterizing it allows for properly tuning the L/R time constant when designing these superconducting devices.
3. The nanoSQUID allows the kinetic inductance per square of the thin film to be directly extracted by measuring the low-frequency DC currents passing through the device. Since the nanoSQUID is patterned on the same thin film material, its response reflects the kinetic inductance of the film itself.

[Context] Hence, if the choke anastomoses between adjacent perforator arteries could be converted into true vascular anastomoses, the area of the donor graft would be greatly increased.Therefore, pre-intervention methods for flap transplantation are frequently conducted to reduce the resistance of the choke area, promote the transition from choke anastomosis to the true anastomosis, and eventually increase the blood perfusion and survival area of the flap.Current interventions include surgical delay, BOTOX injection, and physical expansion, among others.These strategies, however, fail to satisfy clinical needs of emergency surgery due to the long-term cost and complications caused by multiple operations.Further, IRI during the flap transplantation process can trigger chronic inflammation, leading to non-functioning or early dysfunction of the graft.Therefore, a clinically desired intervention method is to timely open choke vessels during emergency surgery, maintain sufficient blood perfusion of the transplanted flap for an extended period, and significantly reduce IRI during the transplantation..
[Question] What are the limitations of current pre-intervention techniques?
Choices:
1. Choke anastomoses are small vessel connections between adjacent perforator arteries in a flap. They restrict blood flow to the distal part of the flap, limiting the viable flap area.

[Context] Importantly, the selectivity of reaction pathways under distinct thermal stimuli, although being a promising strategy to increase synthetic versatility, has remained mostly elusive on surfaces. Here, we introduce surface-confined thermally tunable reaction pathways as a route to select intramolecular versus intermolecular covalent reactions yielding either monomeric phthalocyanines or low-dimensional phthalocyanine polymers, respectively. To this end, we deposit 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethyl-5,10,15,20-tetraazaporphyrin (OETAP) under ultra-high vacuum on a pristine Au(111) crystal held at room temperature, forming close-packed supramolecular assemblies. This precursor phase is gently annealed to 300 °C giving rise to quasi-one-dimensional polymers that can be rationalized as phthalocyanine derivatives. Further insights of the polymerization process with high-resolution low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and state-of-the-art density functional (DFT) calculations reveal that the linkage between two OETAPs is likely to be initiated by a [2+2] cycloaddition, involving the chemical transformations of the peripheral ethyl substituents of two adjacent molecular species. Importantly, by raising the temperature of the substrate prior deposition of the molecular precursors, the intermolecular covalent coupling can be precluded. For substrate temperatures of 300 °C or higher, it is observed that the mechanisms for polymeric growth are blocked and the OETAP species are transformed into individual phthalocyanines, via an electrocyclic ring closure (ERC) reaction, and then self-assembled into islands. DFT simulations support our experimental findings indicating a lower energetic barrier for dimerization as compared with the intramolecular reaction of the monomer. We envision that our results will pave the way for the development of low-dimensional materials exploiting the propensity of molecular precursors equipped with convenient peripheries to undergo tunable covalent reactions under thermal or light stimuli.
[Question] What type of reaction is proposed to initiate the linkage between two OETAP molecules?

2. When the substrate temperature was 300°C or higher prior to OETAP deposition, the intermolecular covalent coupling was precluded. Instead, the OETAP underwent an intramolecular electrocyclic ring closure (ERC) reaction to form individual phthalocyanines.
3. A [2+2] cycloaddition involving the chemical transformations of the peripheral ethyl substituents of two adjacent OETAP molecules is proposed to initiate the linkage between two OETAPs.

[Context] Since there is currently no direct evidence for PATs regulating endothelial function during inflammation, we sought to determine if and how PATs affect vascular barrier properties and leucocyte-endothelium interactions under SIRS relevant conditions, using animal models of systemic inflammation caused by traumatic injury (burns) and septic insult (LPS injection), as well as microvessels and endothelial monolayers stimulated by typical inflammatory mediators (histamine, thrombin or IL-1β). Four sets of experiments were designed to study the DHHC21-PLCβ1 pathway in endothelial inflammation. In the first set of experiments, we evaluated the effects of general pharmacologic inhibition of PATs in vivo during trauma or endotoxemia and in vitro during inflammatory stimulation. We also verified the underlying cellular responses focusing on endothelial cell–cell junction permeability and ICAM-1 expression. In the second set of experiments, after confirming the expression of individual PATs in vascular endothelium, we conducted a functional screening in endothelial monolayers subjected to individual gene knockdown to determine that the presence of specific PATs, namely DHHC21, is required for barrier responses. In the third set of experiments, we used a genetically modified mouse model of DHHC21 function deficiency (Zdhhc21) to evaluate the contribution of this PAT to SIRS-induced organ injury and mortality. The relative importance of endothelial-specific DHHC21 was also evaluated. In the fourth set of experiments, we identified PLCβ1 as a target of DHHC21. Further mechanistic studies were directed at measuring PLCβ1 palmitoylation, subcellular distribution and signalling activity in Zdhhc21 cells. Moreover, comparisons were made in endothelial cells subjected to PLCβ1 knockdown, PLCβ1 wild-type overexpression and PLCβ1 C17 mutant overexpression to determine the mechanistic contribution of PLCβ1 to endothelial dysfunction.

[Context] In this work, two different types of δ-FA-based and a control powder sample of pristine MAPbI3 perovskite active layers are synthesized using a mechanochemically solvent-free solid-state reaction based on grinding method.(i) pristine δ-phase FAPbI3, (ii) FA1−xMAxPbI3, where x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. To address the drawbacks of pure MAPbI3 and pure δ-FAPbI3, we utilized MAPbI3 as crystal seeds to modulate the growth of δ-FAPbI3 crystals and form a high-quality mixed-cation perovskite material FA1−xMAxPbI3 with large grain size, good crystallinity, fewer defects, and higher PCE. To know the influence of MA cation addition on δ-FAPbI3, crystallinity, vibrational structure, element composition, morphology, thermal stability, and optical spectra are presented. More specifically, simulations of the device’s electrical responses are performed using the Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator (SCAPS-1D) software, allowing us to discuss the influence of perovskite composition and evaluate the influences of material characteristics on the device performances of a solar cell. The influence of device parameters, such as the thickness of the absorber layer, spectral response, and external quantum efficiency, are highlighted in this study.

Here we combined ECS with targeted capture for 54 genes, recurrently mutated in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) to enable the detection of clonal mutations at VAFs two orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit of NGS. Using these methods, we sought to thoroughly describe the prevalence and mutation profile of rare haematopoietic clones in healthy individuals, determine if these clones are stable longitudinally, and determine if clonal mutations arise in long-lived haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) or in more committed progenitors. We studied clonal haematopoiesis in longitudinally banked blood samples from middle-aged healthy participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS). We found clonal haematopoiesis, predominantly harbouring mutations in DNMT3A and TET2, in 95% of individuals studied.

[Context] Faster development of reference materials and circumventing these problems could be enabled by rapid on demand synthesis by an automated platform. Such an approach should reduce the need for a long shelf-life. In addition, fast, automated, and controlled synthesis in small batches would allow for more targeted testing of physicochemical properties, and thereby faster convergence on desired properties. In a classical laboratory approach, it is far less time-consuming to create one large batch and perform a full characterization on this system, compared to preparing several small batches distributed over time. This is mainly because of the potential effort required to run multiple syntheses with the required precision and level of reproducibility (i. e. the human factor). Single, large batch synthesis is likely to be problematic if the sample stability is unknown, which could potentially lead to substantial amounts of expensive materials to be wasted if an out-of-specs product is produced. Also, smaller batches benefit from better mixing and less temperature gradients in the reaction solution potentially improving uniformity of acquired materials.
[Question] What are some of the problems with developing reference materials using traditional approaches?
Choices:
1. In a classical lab approach, preparing multiple small batches requires more effort to run each synthesis with precision and reproducibility compared to one large batch. This is mainly due to the human factor involved in reproducing the syntheses.
2. Traditional approaches often require synthesizing reference materials in large batches and with long shelf-lives. This can lead to problems like unknown sample stability, wasting expensive materials if the product goes out of specifications, and difficulty characterizing properties due to the large batch size.
3. If sample stability is unknown, synthesizing large batches could lead to wasting substantial amounts of expensive materials if the product goes out of specifications or degrades over time. It's less risky to synthesize smaller batches.

[Context] Telomerase activity is tightly regulated. Part of this regulation is at the level of abundance, as telomerase is either absent (most human somatic cells) or present in very low amounts, fewer than one complex per telomere (budding and fission yeasts). Even in human stem cells that express telomerase, its activity is low, as heterozygous mutations that reduce the abundance of a telomerase component or telomere structural protein can cause premature death as a result of stem cell failure (reviewed in refs , ). Likewise, telomerase RNA is haplo-insufficient for maintenance of telomere length in both budding and fission yeasts, as is the fission yeast Est1 (Webb and Zakian, in preparation). Telomerase is upregulated in ∼85% of human tumours and its expression promotes tumorigenesis. Thus, understanding telomerase regulation is relevant to ageing and cancer.
[Question] How does the amount of telomerase RNA affect telomere length in yeasts?
Choices:
1. When the abundance of a telomerase component or telomere structural protein is reduced due to heterozygous mutations in human stem cells, it can cause premature death as a result of stem cell failure.
2. Telomerase RNA is haplo-insufficient for maintenance of telomere length in both budding and fission yeasts. This means having only one copy of the gene encoding telomerase RNA, rather than two, is not enough to maintain normal telomere length in yeasts.

[Context] As we know, electret filtration materials are able to improve the ability to capture particles without increasing the pressure drop by making full use of the electrostatic attraction filtration mechanism. To achieve this purpose, MNF is usually corona charging treated just by passing through a high voltage electric field continuously after the polymer melt is extruded out of the spinneret and thermally self-bonded into a fibrous web. To further improve the charge density and stability, additives such as SiO2, BaTiO3, boehmite or boron nitride nanosheets are usually added into the polymer melt. One of the disadvantages of the corona charging process is the oxidation that occurs due to highly energetic charge carriers. This increases the hydrophilicity of fibers, which results in the adsorption of a water film which is susceptible to a gradual degradation of surface charge, eventually exhibiting surface conductivity and charge decay.
[Question] How does increased hydrophilicity of the electret MNF fibers affect the surface charge over time?
Choices:
1. These additives are added to the polymer melt to further improve the charge density and charge stability of the MNF.

[Question] How did the researchers specifically interfere with polyglutamylation in vivo in this study?
Choices:
1. They generated a knock-in mouse that carries C-terminal Tuba4a point mutations (Tuba4aΔpolyGlu). This allowed them to interfere with polyglutamylation specifically at Tuba4a-containing microtubules in vivo.
2. The gene expression pattern of Tuba4a significantly increases at adult stages, leading to the most abundant levels of polyglutamylation, as compared to other tubulins.
3. Neuronal Tuba4a isotypes contain the longest polyglutamyl side chains across the tubulin family. Also, Tuba4a is the only tubulin that lacks a C-terminal tyrosine residue and is therefore independent of another reversible tubulin post-translational modification known as de-tyrosination.
4. De-tyrosination is another reversible tubulin post-translational modification that occurs on tubulins that contain a C-terminal tyrosine residue. Since Tuba4a lacks this C-terminal tyrosine, it is not subject to regulation by de-tyrosination like other tubulins. Its polyglutamylation is therefore independently regulated.

[Context] To overcome such problems, the optimal joint connections for each catalytic domain and module should be identified. Recently, Bode and co-workers reported a new strategy for the manipulation of NRPSs by using exchange units that are sets of A-T-C domains that can be transplanted into active chimeric modules. However, this strategy may not be necessarily applied to hybrid NRPS-PKS systems because the quaternary organization of NRPS-PKS is likely different from that of pure NRPS system. In fact, the quaternary structure of NRPS module is defined as a monomer in the early chromatographic and X-ray crystallographic studies, but we cannot exclude that it works as a dimer in the NRPS-PKS system, as the docking domain from tubulysin system forms a homodimer in the solution. It has thus remained challenging to establish a general rule for rational reconstruction of module assembly lines, and scientists still rely on trial-and-error strategies. One possible solution is to learn how nature diversifies the domain and module organizations by taking advantage of bioinformatics analyses, through comparisons of closely related enzymes. In nature, various module enzymes have evolved through horizontal gene transfer, gene deletion, mutation, and so on to form functional sets of modules. Thus, for cis-AT PKSs, the predominant evolutionary model is a repeated cycle of duplication of ancestral modules coupled with domain exchanges, while for the distinct class of trans-AT PKSs, it is rather horizontal gene transfer that appears to dominate. However, the specific evolutionary history of hybrid cis-AT PKS/NRPS system has yet to be rigorously investigated. It is a promising way to modify the module compositions according to the evolutionary course, because this method is effective to maintain the connectivity between multiple modules while minimizing the change of the overall structure and the protein–protein interactions which underlie their function. The knowledge on the constraint for NRPS-PKS engineering should be accumulated more to understand how this system has been evolved and can be manipulated.
[Question] What is a promising strategy discussed in the text for modifying module compositions while minimizing changes to overall structure/protein interactions?
Choices:
1. The specific evolutionary history of hybrid cis-AT PKS/NRPS systems has yet to be rigorously investigated according to the text. Filling this knowledge gap could help guide effective module modification based on evolutionary constraints.
2. There are a few key challenges. First, the optimal joint connections for each catalytic domain and module need to be identified, but transplanting A-T-C domains from NRPS systems may not work for hybrid NRPS-PKS systems since their quaternary organization is likely different. Second, while NRPS modules are defined as monomers, NRPS-PKS systems may function as dimers, so the organization is still unclear. Finally, scientists have had to rely on trial-and-error strategies since a general rule has not yet been established.
3. For cis-AT PKSs, the predominant model seems to be repeated duplication of ancestral modules coupled with domain exchanges. In contrast, for trans-AT PKSs, horizontal gene transfer appears to be the dominant diversifying evolutionary mechanism.
4. The text suggests modifying module compositions according to the evolutionary course of hybrid cis-AT PKS/NRPS systems. This is promising because it could maintain connectivity between modules while minimizing changes to overall structure and protein-protein interactions that are important for function. The rationale is that nature has diversified domain/module organizations through evolution via mechanisms like horizontal gene transfer.

[Context] Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is one of the widely used, powerful tools for detection and quantification of selected genes, for validation of transcriptome or microarray data, and for screening of drug targets. For relative quantification, the normalisation of the data with a reference gene is essential to avoid the background noise. A stable reference gene should maintain a stable expression under different experimental conditions in all tissue types tested. Thus, the selection of appropriate reference gene is a daunting task as transcript expression levels vary with physiology, pathology, and developmental stage. There is no single reference gene, which is universally expressed at constant levels in all species under different experimental conditions. More than one gene has been found to have stable expression at different developmental stages, in different tissues types and under various patho-physiological conditions for a single organism. Thus, it is necessary to validate a potential reference gene for each new species before evaluating their gene expression patterns. There are different statistical algorithms such as geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper that have been used for the determination of candidate reference gene stability under one or several experimental conditions. These programs have been used to identify stable reference genes in many plants, fish and insects.
[Question] Why is it necessary to validate potential reference genes before use in a new species or condition?
Choices:
1. Validation is required because reference gene stability can differ between species, tissues, developmental stages, and experimental conditions. Presumed stable genes may not be appropriate for the specific context, so empirical validation provides confidence in normalization.
2. Normalization with a reference gene is essential to avoid background noise and allow accurate relative quantification of gene expression. The reference gene provides a baseline to compare the expression of the target gene.
3. An ideal reference gene should have stable expression levels under different experimental conditions, tissue types, developmental stages, and pathologies. It should not vary significantly between samples.
4. geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper are algorithms used to assess the stability of candidate reference genes under experimental conditions. They help identify the most stable genes for normalization.

In order to address these questions, here we investigate NS1-specific antibody responses in a cohort of patients with acute secondary dengue (DENV1 and DENV2) infection and study how NS1-specific antibody responses evolve during the course of illness in relation to clinical disease severity. We further characterize anti-NS1 antibody responses in patients and healthy individuals with varying severity of past dengue infection to identify epitope regions within the NS1 protein that associate with disease progression or protection.
[Question] What is Dengvaxia and what is unique about it compared to other dengue vaccines?

[Question] What mechanisms have plants evolved to survive drought conditions?
Choices:
1. To compensate for their sessile lifestyle, plants have evolved acclimation and adaptation mechanisms like antioxidant defense systems and osmotic adjustment. These mechanisms can enhance a plant's capability to survive and grow during both short-term and long-term drought stress.
2. During water shortage, plants produce excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2, O2 and H2O2. These ROS are highly reactive and can rapidly damage living tissues and molecules like DNA, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates in plants, potentially leading to programmed cell death (PCD).
3. The overproduction of ROS like O2, O2 and H2O2 under severe drought stress can lead to irrecoverable damage and injuries to the green tissues of plants because of the high reactivity of ROS. This puts the plant at risk.
4. Antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and enzymes in the Halliwell-Asada pathway (GR, APX, DHAR, MDHAR) play an important role in scavenging and cleansing the activated oxygen species produced during drought. Regulating the activity of these enzymes is likely a key process in plant tolerance to drought stress.

In Japan, five-year progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of patients with stage II/III ASCC were reported to be 85.7% and 87.3%, respectively. As reported in these clinical trials, the outcome of ASCC without distant metastatic lesions treated with CCRT is relatively good, but some cases are refractory, and their prognosis is poor. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the genetic and/or immunological backgrounds of patients with ASCC refractory to CCRT for the development of new treatments, such as molecular targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors.

2. It exemplifies that reproducing and tailoring complex structures through hierarchical non-covalent interactions is achievable with relatively singular molecules if the structural parameters are finely tuned.

[Context] We report that the promotion of Arabidopsis root hair elongation under low external P requires the concerted activities of the auxin synthesis, transport, and response pathway components. Mutants disrupting these distinct auxin pathways attenuate the ability of root tissues to promote hair elongation in response to low external P conditions. Reporter lines revealed that under low P conditions auxin levels are up-regulated at the root tip, whilst targeted expression studies demonstrate that auxin is mobilized via AUX1 to the root hair differentiation zone. Elevated auxin levels in trichoblasts trigger a gene expression cascade, mediated by transcription factors ARF19, RSL2, and RSL4 that promotes hair elongation. In parallel papers, we demonstrate that this auxin-dependent root hair response to low external P is highly conserved in the monocot model rice and relies on TIR1 to promote hair elongation via elevated intracellular auxin and calcium signaling responses.

[Context] The shelterin complex, which includes TRF homology domain proteins TRF1 and TRF2, TIN2, TPP1 and POT1, protects telomeric ends from DNA damage response activation and recruits telomerase to regulate telomere length. TRF1 and TRF2 form structural homodimers through their TRF homology domains, which mediate direct interactions with TIN2, and preferentially bind telomeric double-stranded DNA through C-terminal MYB domains. TIN2 recruits telomerase-binding protein TPP1, which in turn recruits telomeric single-stranded DNA-binding protein POT1. Short peptide motifs of TIN2 and related proteins bind to sites near the dimeric cleft of TRF proteins, providing two possible binding sites per TRF dimer. However, the reconstituted shelterin core of TRF2-TIN2-TPP1–POT1 has a stoichiometry of 2.1.1.1 in vitro, suggesting that binding events are limited by steric hindrance within the wider structural assembly. Shelterin provides a means of telomere recognition for the meiotic telomere complex, which physically connects it to the LINC complex, thereby integrating their functions to achieve cytoskeletal attachments of meiotic telomere ends across the nuclear envelope.

[Context] The presence of the paddlewheel effect in LPS glass at low temperatures is straightforward to explain. First, this glass contains PS4 complex anions. rotations of these anions will exert a force on the cations. Second, due to imperfect ionic packing (amorphous structure), the glass has a lower density than the crystalline analog, γ-Li3PS4. This lower density provides the additional free volume needed to allow for anion rotations. Third, while a lower density (relative to the crystalline phase) is a property common to any glass, a distinguishing feature of the 75Li2S–25P2S5 composition is the relative absence of a long-ranged covalent network comprising longer-chain PxSy anions. The presence of such a network can impede PS4 rotations and slow down Li migration. Notably, the 75–25 composition maximizes the number of compact and rotatable PS4 anions, while minimizing less rotationally active longer-chain PxSy components. Glasses that exhibit this combination of features—that contain complex anions, yet have limited network-forming ability—have the potential to exhibit paddlewheel dynamics at low temperature, and thus may be promising SEs.
[Question] Why does the 75Li2S-25P2S5 composition of LPS glass maximize the paddlewheel effect?

P6. p, the cell closest to the AC, assumes 1° fate, the neighbouring VPCs P5. p and P7. p assume 2° fate and the remaining VPCs assume 3° fate. This cell fate pattern is thought to be established in the following manner. activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) LET-23 by LIN-3 induces EGF/Ras signalling and subsequent upregulation of Notch ligands lag-2, apx-1 and dsl-1 in each VPC in a graded manner, depending on the external LIN-3 concentration. Next, the Notch ligands stimulate lateral Notch signalling via the Notch receptor LIN-12, resulting in the inhibition of EGF/Ras signalling in neighbouring VPCs. As a consequence, the higher initial level of Notch ligands in P6. p eventually leads to full inhibition of EGF/Ras signalling in P(5,7). p.

[Context] In humans, protein myristoylation is mediated by two ubiquitously expressed N-myristoyl-transferases, NMT1, and NMT2, which add a 14 carbon fatty acid myristate onto numerous proteins.Myristoylation plays a fundamental role in cell signaling and allows for the dynamic interactions of proteins with cell membranes.Myristoylation occurs at the N-terminal glycine residue of proteins either co-translationally after the removal of the initiator methionine or post-translationally after caspase-cleavage during apoptosis.Up to 600 proteoforms in humans are myristoylated and the proper membrane targeting and functions of these proteins require myristoylation.SFKs, Abl, Gα subunits, Arf GTPases, caspase truncated (ct-) Bid, and ct-PAK2 are examples of myristoylated proteins that critically regulate cell growth and apoptosis.Recently, NMTs were also shown to be responsible for myristoylation of N-terminally located lysine residues of Arf6 GTPase, thereby adding to their roles in cell signaling.Because NMTs are essential for the viability of parasites, small molecule inhibitors such as DDD85646 were developed as a T.brucei NMT inhibitor to treat African sleeping sickness.DDD85646 was also synthesized and validated independently as a bona fide inhibitor of human NMTs under the name IMP-366.Because NMT expression levels and activity are increased in some cancers, NMTs have been proposed to be anticancer targets.However, the effect of NMT inhibitors in cancer has not been systematically investigated..

[Context] An alternative approach to DNA-based strain separation that has very rarely been applied to microalgae and cyanobacteria is proteomic-based chemotaxonomic biotyping using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Using mass spectrometers for characterising microorganisms began in 1975. Thereafter, the methods were rapidly optimised and expanded to include clinical and environmental species. MALDI-TOF-MS biotyping has successfully been used to identify bacteria, yeast, fungi and even higher eukaryotes including insects, molluscs and fish. It has also been used in clinical and environmental contexts to identify and differentiate between strains of the pathogenic, microalga Prototheca and the bloom forming cyanobacterium Oscillatoria. However, the potential for the approach to be applied to blue biotechnology has not hitherto been explored. As the molecular basis for the differences in MALDI-TOF-MS spectra are generally unknown the differences cannot be assumed to reflect phylogeny. The power of the method is in the potential capacity to discriminate between closely related organisms.

[Context] Evidence for a functional role of GLUT4 dispersal in the control of glucose transport has been provided by our recent demonstration that impairment of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 dispersal is accompanied by reduced insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Furthermore, insulin resistance was found to induce a more clustered distribution of GLUT4, with more molecules per cluster, implying that the regulation of post-fusion GLUT4 distribution may be impaired in disease. Multiple defects in GLUT4 trafficking have been identified in insulin resistance/Type 2 diabetes, including reduced translocation and impaired GLUT4 vesicle tethering.

[Context] Human mt-AspRS is the most prominent case with the largest number of reported mutations (60). These are spread throughout the DARS2 gene within a cohort of 78 patients belonging to 58 families. All these mutations are correlated with Leukoencephalopathy with Brain stem and Spinal cord involvement and Lactate elevation (LBSL), an autosomal recessive neurological disorder most often manifesting in early childhood and showing a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. LBSL patients suffer from impairment of motor function and manual ability and loss of cognitive function to various degrees. Magnetic resonance imaging reveals characteristic abnormalities in the cerebral white matter, the cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord. In general, if the first neurological signs of disease appear in infancy (infantile/early onset LBSL), they are followed by severe neurological deterioration and the loss of the ability to walk in adolescence. If symptoms appear later (adult/late onset LBSL), the disease evolves at a slower pace but the patients need support for walking or become wheelchair dependent at the end of their lives (reviewed in). LBSL patients are mainly compound heterozygous, but cases of homozygous mutations have been described in two families. More than two thirds of the compound heterozygotes carry a mutation in a poly-pyrimidine tract at the 3′ end of intron 2 in one allele that affects the correct splicing of the third exon. This leads to a frameshift and a premature stop, but the defect is called “leaky” because it does not fully stop the expression of full-length mt-AspRS.

[Context] Temporal coding via STDP may be essential for the role of the striatum in learning of motor sequences in which sensory and motor events are associated in a precise time sequence. Corticostriatal long-term plasticity provides a fundamental mechanism for the function of the basal ganglia in procedural learning. MSNs act as detectors of distributed patterns of cortical and thalamic activity. Thus, the physiological or pathological regulation of EAAT2 expression should play a major role in information processing in the basal ganglia, which is based on a precise time-coding process. EAAT2 is highly expressed in the striatum and specific knockout of astrocytic EAAT2 leads to pathological repetitive behaviours due to corticostriatal dysfunction. We have previously shown, by dual astrocyte-neuron recordings, that EAAT2 controls corticostriatal transmission and short-term plasticity, and increases the strength of cortical input filtering by the striatum. Here we questioned the role of astrocytes (via EAAT2) in the control of Hebbian plasticity expression, and, more specifically, corticostriatal STDP. We find that under a transient blockade of EAAT2, a non-Hebbian form of plasticity occurring for uncorrelated events replaces STDP. By contrast, EAAT2 overexpression impairs the detection of correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity by MSNs, resulting in the absence of plasticity. We demonstrate here that astrocytes, via EAAT2, set the appropriate glutamate dynamics for the emergence and the establishment of synaptic Hebbian learning rule, such as STDP.

[Context] We therefore sought to investigate the costimulatory ligands induced in APC by CD40 engagement that can generate positive signals capable of conferring this functional capacity through receptors expressed on naïve CTL. The CD27–CD70 receptor/ligand pair is of interest in this regard, as members of the TNF-receptor superfamily (TNFSF) have been shown to control growth and survival of T cells. CD27 is expressed on naïve CTL, as well as CD4 T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and a subset of B cells, and expression of its one known ligand, CD70 can be induced on dendritic cells by the combined stimulation of inflammatory and TH-mediated pathways (via CD40). Several lines of evidence suggest that CD70 induction is an important functional downstream consequence of TH-mediated dendritic cell (DC) activation, and that engagement of CD27 on CTL represents a crucial step in their acquisition of the memory state. First, upregulation of CD70 on DC—either by CD40-activation, inflammatory stimuli, or through transgenic expression, is directly associated with their ability to prime both effector and memory CTL, as well as reversing tolerance to self-antigen. Conversely, blockade of CD70 blunts the induction of CTL when measured as either primary effectors or memory cells. Lastly, the absence of CD27 on CD8 T cells has been shown to profoundly diminish the generation and maintenance of both effector and memory CTL in some, but not all, models of viral infection, suggesting that either inflammation and/or antigen persistence may have a role in determining the requirement for this pathway. Although these studies make clear that the CD27/CD70 pathway can have a crucial role in CTL priming, they reveal variability in its requirement depending on the nature of the immunogen and do not unambiguously specify a role for CD27 in communicating the help message to CTL. To overcome these issues, we have assessed the role of CD27–CD70 interactions in the primary and secondary CTL response to both replicating and nonreplicating immunogens using an in vivo system in which the expression of CD27 can be manipulated exclusively on the responding CTL.
[Question] What did the authors investigate in this study?

1. Studies show the CD27/CD70 pathway can have a crucial role in CTL priming, but its requirement varies depending on the immunogen. The studies do not unambiguously specify a role for CD27 in communicating T helper cell help to CTLs.

[Context] To show how fungal PX is incorporated into the core assembly and how its stoichiometry is regulated, we present a structural analysis of the PDC from the fungal model organism Neurospora crassa. We consider the implicit symmetrization caused by the icosahedral E2 core and are able to determine tetrahedral reconstructions, showing how the fungal PDC departs from the dominating symmetry without introducing symmetry mismatches. The tetrahedral-symmetric arrangement of PX interior to the icosahedral PDC core dictates a complex composition similar to that suggested for mammalian PDC. Based on its oligomeric state and size, we also identify factors that offer a simple explanation for the range of previously presented PDC component ratios in fungi. We confirm that PX is critical to N. crassa pyruvate metabolism, and that by extension the stoichiometric ratio of the complex components is pivotal to overall activity. Any change in PX oligomer stability and/or size would therefore affect PDC component stoichiometry, which could be utilized to allow fungi to tune PDC component activity in a dynamic fashion. Further, we discuss the fidelity of the established classification and exemplify how marginalized reconstruction leads to uncertainty in the classified proportions of cryo-EM particles, which is crucial to the interpretation of the present results.

[Context] The relationship between specific winter climate changes and community changes may finally be obscured because microarthropod communities are only effectively sampled during the snow-free Arctic summer and thus may reflect an integration of consequences of preceding winter/spring conditions rather than the effect of spring temperature alone. Studies that sampled microarthropod communities in Arctic ecosystems over time are scarce, but show considerable variability in densities over different years. Natural variability in snow patterning may be a driving force behind these differences in microarthopod densities over years, and at the same time determine the magnitude of the effects of climate change induced changes in snow cover. For example, a deepening of the snow pack of 10 cm may affect soil temperatures in a snow poor winter much more than in a snow-rich winter. In addition, the state of the microarthopod community before the winter season may determine to what extent they are affected by changes in winter conditions. Natural annual variation in winter conditions may thus determine to which extent soil organisms are affected by e. g. extreme events or changes in snowpack.
[Question] How may the state of the microarthropod community before winter determine how they are affected by winter conditions?

[Context] Diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion are ischemic retinopathies that are prevalent causes of vision loss in working age individuals. The most common cause of vision loss in each is macular edema due to leakage from retinal blood vessels. Pilot trials demonstrated that intraocular injections of ranibizumab provided substantial reduction of intraretinal fluid in the macula and improvement in vision. These findings were confirmed in phase 3 studies that led to FDA approval of ranibizumab for treatment of diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion. Follow-up studies showed that suppression of VEGF reduced progression of retinal vessel closure and caused improvement in perfusion in some patients with retinal vein occlusion or diabetic macular edema (DME), and improved background diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME. These two effects of VEGF suppression are related because slowly progressive closure of retinal vessels is strongly associated with progression of background diabetic retinopathy. Thus, increased VEGF in the retina drives disease progression of diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion and sustained suppression of VEGF can halt progression and cause improvement.

[Context] In addition to these regimens, liver support systems are an option for supportive therapy. The concept of these systems is to clear blood of hepatotoxic substances, such as cytokines, BA, and endotoxins to avoid further damage of the hepatocytes. A recently published systematic meta-analysis showed evidence of the reduction in mortality with liver support systems. However, different systems are available. One opportunity is to implement plasma exchange, which can improve outcomes, but is expensive and can lead to hypotension and bleeding complications. Another approach is albumin dialysis, for example, with Advanced Organ Support (ADVOS) or MARS. ADVOS is an advanced hemodialysis system combining different forms of organ support (kidney, lung, liver) using three circuits. the extracorporeal blood circuit, the dialysate circuit, and the albumin multi circuit. It aims to remove water-bound and albumin-bound toxins, in addition to CO2, and correct acid–base disturbances. Although case studies have shown this effect, it has not yet been established in daily intensive care practice.
[Question] How does the ADVOS system work as a form of albumin dialysis?

[Context] In addition to utilizing hard coatings in water lubrication, use of additives in water to reduce friction and wear was also proposed. The purpose of using the additives was to overcome the limitations associated with low viscosity of water. Thus, attempts were made to attain sufficient water film thickness by exploiting soluble polymer and biomolecules or insoluble Cu nanoparticles, nanodiamonds (NDs) and graphene as additives. Kinoshita et al. investigated the effects of using monolayer GO sheets as water-based lubricant additives. With an addition of 0.01 wt.% of GO in water, a low friction coefficient of 0.05 could be maintained for 60000 sliding cycles. Also, Elomaa et al. investigated the effects of GO content in water on the friction and wear properties of DLC coatings. Experimental results revealed that the friction coefficient of DLC coating could be significantly decreased to ~0.06 with an addition of 1 wt.% of GO. However, in practical situations, the use of additives in the lubricating fluid may not be a good solution since the additives themselves can be a source of pollution and the cost of the lubricant rise significantly.

[Context] Another possible method to overcome the worse performance of multi-task learning than single-task learning is knowledge distillation. Knowledge distillation is a training method that transfers the knowledge from a “teacher” model to a “student” model by guiding the student model to follow the predictions of the teacher model. Knowledge distillation has been used for compressing models. Recent studies have shown that this method also makes the student model outperform its teacher. In a recent study, the authors present a training method called Born-Again Multi-tasking (BAM) to address the performance degradation of multi-task learning. They apply knowledge distillation to a model of natural language understanding tasks through a novel method called teacher annealing. In this method, the rate of predictions of the teacher model gradually decreases while the rate of the true label increases during training. Consequently, the BAM model outperforms both single-task learning and multi-task learning models. Inspired by these studies, we propose a method that benefits from the advantage of multi-task learning and minimizes possible negative effects. We apply group selection and knowledge distillation in the multi-task learning setting to molecular binding prediction tasks. In molecular binding prediction, molecules are regarded as data samples, and their binding targets are regarded as tasks. Therefore, targets are grouped according to their similarities in group selection. We use a ligand-based similarity approach to determine the similarity between targets. Similarity ensemble approach or SEA is applied for selecting similar targets. SEA is a method that forms associations between targets according to their active ligand set similarity. It computes the ligand similarity based on ligand structure and uses it to estimate the similarity between targets. This method has been successfully used in research associated with the molecule-target binding task. Similarity between targets are computed by SEA and hierarchical clustering is applied to group the similar targets.
[Question] How are the final target groups formed in this work?
Choices:
1. Recent studies have shown that applying knowledge distillation to multi-task learning models can help the student model outperform its teacher model. This helps address the performance degradation sometimes seen with multi-task learning.

These models suggest that AlgL undertakes a maintenance role in the periplasm by degrading alginate that has been misguided due to inefficient translocation/secretion, deletion of a subunit or destabilization of the complex. However, they disagree on whether AlgL is part of the biosynthesis apparatus. For instance, while Bakkevig et al. suggested that AlgL only served a maintenance role (thus is likely to be a free periplasmic protein), Jain and Ohman postulated that it also facilitated translocation and secretion of the polymer, therefore forming a structural component of the multi-protein complex. However, evidence for protein-protein interactions between AlgL and other components of the complex was still lacking.

[Context] Plants have evolved two distinct strategies to cope with Fe deficiency. In the reduction strategy, root plasma membrane H-ATPases act to acidify the rhizosphere, thereby increasing the local solubility of Fe. Fe is then reduced to Fe by a membrane-bound ferric-chelate reductase enzyme such as AtFRO2 and this appears to be a major rate-limiting step in Fe uptake. Subsequently, Fe is transported into the root by plasma-membrane divalent cation transporters such as IRT1, a plasma-membrane divalent cation transporter regulated by the bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor FIT. The alternative strategy involves chelation, here, the mechanism operates through the release of phytosiderophores, which avidly bind Fe. The chelated complex is transported into the roots via YSL transporters such as the product of OsYSL15, a rice gene which is strongly induced by Fe deficiency throughout the root.
[Question] How does the reduction strategy work?
Choices:
1. In the reduction strategy, root plasma membrane H-ATPases act to acidify the rhizosphere, thereby increasing the local solubility of iron. The iron is then reduced to Fe2+ by a membrane-bound ferric-chelate reductase enzyme such as AtFRO2. This reduction appears to be a major rate-limiting step in iron uptake. The Fe2+ is then transported into the root by plasma-membrane divalent cation transporters such as IRT1.
2. FIT is a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) transcription factor that regulates IRT1, which is a plasma-membrane divalent cation transporter involved in transporting iron into the root. So FIT regulates an important part of the iron uptake process in the reduction strategy.
3. In the reduction strategy, iron is reduced to Fe2+ outside the root and transported into the root. In the chelation strategy, phytosiderophores are released to chelate and bind iron, and the chelated complex is transported into the root. The reduction strategy involves iron reduction, while the chelation strategy involves iron chelation.
4. In the chelation strategy, the mechanism operates through the release of phytosiderophores from the plant. Phytosiderophores avidly bind iron. The chelated iron-phytosiderophore complex is then transported into the roots via YSL transporters such as OsYSL15 in rice.

[Context] The silkworm, Bombyx mori, is a lepidopteran insect of great importance because of its use in silk production and its research value for understanding the biology of insects. The silk gland (SG) of B. mori is a specialized organ in which silk proteins are efficiently synthesized and spun out to build cocoons. Generally, the SG is divided into three morphologically and functionally distinct parts. the anterior silk gland (ASG), the middle silk gland (MSG), and the posterior silk gland (PSG). PSG is the only part that synthesizes fibroin protein, a major component that accounts for approximately 75% of silk fibers. The regulation of fibroin protein synthesis is particularly interesting and rather complex. In brief, the expression of genes encoding fibroin proteins, including the fibroin heavy chain (fibH), fibroin light chain (fibL), and a 25-kD polypeptide protein (P25), is synchronously switched on during intermolt larval stages and switched off during molt stages. Remarkably, massive amounts of fibroin protein are rapidly synthesized in PSG cells beginning on the 3 day of the fifth instar in larvae. Previous studies have suggested that fibroin gene expression is regulated by many regulatory factors at the transcriptional level in a concerted manner. It is therefore of profound interest to elucidate the factors involved to better understand the regulatory mechanisms of both SG development and silk protein synthesis.
[Question] What is the silkworm Bombyx mori and why is it important?
[Answer] ","The silkworm Bombyx mori is a lepidopteran insect that is very important for two main reasons.

[Context] Rational design of materials is the ultimate goal of modern materials science and engineering. As part of achieving that goal, there has been a large effort in the materials science community to compile extensive data sets of materials properties to provide scientists and engineers with ready access to the properties of known materials. Today, there are databases of crystal structures, superconducting critical temperatures (), physical properties of crystalline compounds and many other repositories containing useful materials data. Recently, it has been shown that these databases can also serve as resources for creating predictive models and design rules—the key tools of rational materials design. These databases have grown large enough that the discovery of such design rules and models is impractical to accomplish by relying simply on human intuition and knowledge about material behaviour. Rather than relying directly on intuition, machine learning offers the promise of being able to create accurate models quickly and automatically.
[Question] What effort has the materials science community made toward achieving the goal of rational design of materials?
Choices:
1. Predictive models and design rules are important for rational materials design because they allow materials scientists and engineers to design new materials in an intentional, knowledge-driven way, rather than relying solely on trial-and-error.

[Question] What is proximity labeling (PL)?
Choices:
1. PL methods offer both cell-type and subcellular compartment specific information about the identified proteins. PL enables taking snapshots of the proteome with restricted spatial labeling and on short temporal scales.
2. Genetically encoded fast PL like APEX2 offers rapid labeling on the order of seconds. This enables taking snapshots of the proteome on short timescales. Also, PL can be targeted to specific cell types in the brain using transgenic mouse models. Therefore, fast genetically encoded PL methods can potentially enable mapping proteome changes of specific cell types in the brain across subcellular domains and short time periods.
3. Proximity labeling (PL) is an alternative approach to bio-orthogonal labeling. Genetically encoded labeling enzymes such as BioID, TurboID, and APEX2 can be expressed and localized to a specific subcellular compartment. In the presence of exogenous biotin substrates, in situ biotinylation occurs rapidly, from minutes to hours for TurboID, and within seconds for APEX2.
4. In the brain, changes in transcriptional and translational programs occur across short and long timescales and among multiple intermixed cell types, across their subcellular domains. Given the sophisticated organization and function of neural circuits, mapping activity-dependent changes at the proteome level and of a single cell type remains challenging.

[Context] PTEs pollution led to the aggravation of land degradation and the gradual reduction of production land. Therefore, researchers at home and abroad continue to increase their enthusiasm for soil remediation. Fixed PTEs means to stabilize or reduce their mobility in the soil, with the aim of reducing the bioavailability of plants, animals and humans and reducing the leaching of PTEs to groundwater. Over the past few decades, a variety of remediation methods for PTEs contaminated soils have been investigated, including soil washing, electric remediation, solidification/stabilization, phytoremediation and biological/microbial treatment, vitrification landfill and bioreactor to reduce heavy metal bioavailability. Among these methods, cleaning the contaminated soil was difficult and time-consuming, so there was a need to develop techniques to fix heavy metals in the soil before returning it to agricultural use. Soil amendments not only act as immobilization agents for PTEs, but also improve plant growth and soil health by providing nutrients, improving soil structure, and enhancing holding capacity.

In the past decade, the development of high-performance polymer building blocks, including indacenodithiophene, naphthalene diimide (NDI), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), isoindigo (IID), and benzodifurandione-based oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (BDOPV), have greatly promoted the charge carrier mobility enhancement in conjugated polymers. Conjugated polymers with open-shell character can be obtained by chemical doping. However, the doped polymers are unstable and the ionized dopants always result in large structural and energetic disorders. In addition, doped semiconducting polymers are always conductors while losing their semiconducting properties. Recently, conjugated polymers at their neutral ground state were reported to have open-shell high-spin character, but these polymers showed conducting properties with limited applications in semiconducting devices.

[Context] Here we demonstrate magnon transport over micro-meters in the ultra-low damping, orthoferrite YFeO3 making use of a transport mode unique to this type of system. This key observation of a promising transport mode opens up a large number of technologically relevant materials for low power, antiferromagnetic magnonic devices. Using an external magnetic field to manipulate the magnon eigenmode polarization, we characterize the transport efficiency and identify the dominant role of the Néel vector. Although the zero-field magnon eigenmodes are non-degenerate, unlike in easy-axis hematite, they are linearly polarized and unable to facilitate zero-field magnon transport. On applying an external field, the magnon eigenmodes become elliptically polarized when the field has a nonzero projection on the Néel vector, thus enabling efficient magnonic spin current transport over long distances. Both the exponential decay of spin transport signal with distance and its vanishing magnitude at lower temperature indicate a diffusive nature to the transport. The transport is furthermore anisotropic and we demonstrate that the magnon decay length varies between the different crystallographic axes, which can be explained by the anisotropic magnon group velocity arising from anisotropic exchange stiffness.
[Question] How did the researchers demonstrate anisotropic magnon transport?
Choices:
1. The magnon decay length varied along different crystal axes of YFeO3. This anisotropy arises from the anisotropic magnon group velocity, which is related to the anisotropic exchange stiffness.
2. Both the exponential decay of the spin transport signal with distance and its decrease in magnitude at lower temperatures indicate diffusive magnon transport.

[Context] Unlike peptides, which have limited cell permeability in the absence of a permeability tag such as a TAT fusion and undesired protein degradation, small molecule inhibitors can be designed for cell-permeability and reduced degradation. Early inhibitors of PDZ domains were short peptides which matched the key residues of the endogenous ligand. Later, modified peptides, cyclic peptides and peptidomimetics, were used as tools to inhibit PDZ domains, producing limited success. Recently, dimeric peptides with increased binding affinity by simultaneously interacting with multiple PDZ domains have been proposed as pharmacological tools. But none of these molecules are suitable for therapeutic intervention due to their poor potency, selectivity and/or distribution properties. Until our initial disclosure of the pharmacology of the first high affinity, non-peptide inhibitor, the only reported small molecule inhibitors of PDZ domains (including FSC231 for PICK1) were weakly binding molecules. Here we describe the discovery and profiling of this series of potent and selective PICK1 inhibitors.
[Question] What were some of the early approaches to developing PDZ domain inhibitors?
Choices:
1. The text states the authors describe the discovery and profiling of a series of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of PICK1. Based on the text, these are the first high affinity non-peptide inhibitors of a PDZ domain.
2. The text states that prior to the authors' initial disclosure, the only reported small molecule inhibitors of PDZ domains were weakly binding molecules. This includes molecules like FSC231 for PICK1.
3. The text mentions several limitations of using peptides as PDZ domain inhibitors. Peptides have limited cell permeability unless fused to a tag like TAT. Peptides also tend to undergo undesired protein degradation. These factors make peptides less suitable as therapeutic inhibitors.
4. The text states that early inhibitors of PDZ domains were short peptides matching key residues of the endogenous ligand.

[Context] Experimentally, direct imaging of light oxygen together with heavy cations using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) serves as the decisive basis to resolve chirality at the ferroelectric domain walls. This requirement is fulfilled by the negative spherical-aberration (CS) imaging (NCSI) technique in an aberration-corrected TEM. In comparison with the conventional positive CS imaging technique, the NCSI technique yields an especially high image contrast. Specifically, the robust image contrast is enhanced by superposition of the amplitude contrast because of electron diffraction channelling with the phase contrast. As a result, atoms appear sharp and bright on a dark background, light and heavy elements can be clearly imaged together and picometre-precision measurements of atomic positions become accessible.

[Context] One of these approaches is to control the energy-level alignment of the system by modifying the chemical structure of the molecules inside the junctions. In reality, it is difficult to predict how changes to the chemical structure of the junctions affect the electrical properties of the junctions and seemingly contradicting results have been reported. In SAM-based junctions, the difficulty of controlling the energy-level alignment due to Fermi-level pinning has been well-recognized. For example, Frisbie and co-workers showed that changing the work function of the metal had a noticeable effect on the contact resistance (due to a large surface dipole at the metal–thiolate interface) but not on the energy-level alignment. Similarly, Blom and co-workers found that introducing additional dipoles in the SAM structure results in large work function shifts. In contrast, Whitesides and co-workers observed that the tunnelling rates across aliphatic SAMs in EGaIn junctions were independent of dipoles or acidity of small end groups of alkanethiolate SAMs. We confirmed these findings by Whitesides and co-workers for a small subset of SAM structures, but Whitesides and co-workers and we also showed that other functionalities, such ferrocene (Fc) and redox-active aromatic groups, or polarizable groups (halogens), did change the junction characteristics and induced rectification or changed the tunnelling rates, respectively. These studies show, as a group, that it is indeed difficult to predict which kind of chemical functionalities result in a noticeable change in the electrical characteristics of the junctions. One of the reasons is that changes in the molecular structure also result in changes of the molecule–electrode interactions and the supramolecular structure of the SAM making it difficult to isolate the factors that dominate the charge transport rates.

[Context] Several theoretical studies have attempted to reveal the TADF mechanism in MR molecules. Northey et al. investigated an intersystem-crossing (ISC) mechanism in DABNA-1 using quantum dynamics and time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) at the PBE0/6-31 G(d) level. There was only a 0.02-eV energy difference between T2 and S1, ∆E(T2 → S1). However, ∆E(T1 → S1) and ∆E(T1 → T2) were large, 0.59 eV and 0.61 eV, respectively, which could not explain efficient RISC from T1 to S1. Gao et al. examined the density-functional dependence of ∆E(T1 → S1) within the framework of TD-DFT. The MPWK1CIS functional reproduced the experimental ∆E(T1 → S1), as reviewed by Suresh et al. However, the RISC rate constant (kRISC) was not calculated and the TADF mechanism was unclear.

Pershin et al. reported that TD-DFT methods overestimated ∆E(T1 → S1) for MR molecules, and that the spin-component-scaling second-order approximate coupled-cluster (SCS-CC2) method outperformed TD-DFT for predicting ∆E(T1 → S1). The partial inclusion of double excitations within the SCS-CC2 method was responsible for the improved accuracy in predicting ∆E(T1 → S1). The SCS-CC2 calculation of DABNA-1-based molecules revealed the relationship between its molecular structure and electronic properties, ∆E(T1 → S1), and the fluorescence rate constant. However, the TADF mechanism was still unclear because the kRISC was not calculated. Lin et al. calculated rate constants for fluorescence (kF), ISC (kISC), kRISC, and internal conversion (IC) (kIC) for DABNA-1. However, the calculated kRISC was 6.7 × 10s, which was much less than the experimental value of 1.0 × 10 s. The calculated kISC of 1.4 × 10s was two orders of magnitude less than the experimental value of 4.5 × 10 s. In addition, the calculated nonradiative decay, kIC(S1 → S0), was greater than the kF(S1 → S0), suggesting that the PLQY of DABNA-1 was less than 50%, in contrast with the 88% experimental value.

[Context] Thus, we studied cultured, polarized AECs derived from control and alcohol-fed animals as a model system that reflects the behaviour of these cells in vivo in forming the alveolar barrier. AECs from alcohol-fed animals have significant changes in tight-junction protein expression that are associated with a decrease in epithelial barrier function. Among these changes is an increase in claudin-5 expression. By molecular manipulation of AECs we find that claudin-5 is both necessary and sufficient to disrupt AEC tight junctions. Increased claudin-5 expression induces the formation of claudin-containing structures perpendicular to the axis of the cell–cell interface (tight-junction spikes) that are active sites of vesicle budding and fusion. The appearance of tight-junction spikes correlates with increased paracellular leak between AECs. Using several complementary approaches, including super-resolution microscopy and the proximity ligation assay (PLA), we find that claudin-5 interacted with claudin-18, and that this decreases the ability of claudin-18 to productively interact with zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1). This provides the first example of one claudin affecting the ability of another claudin to interact with the tight-junction scaffold. This mechanism is targetable using a claudin-5 mimetic peptide, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach to promote alveolar barrier function.

We find that the embedded Au SFTs reveal a remarkable decoupling from their metal surrounding, which can be attributed to their stacking-fault-type origin. This implies that the SFTs may be considered as metallic quantum dots that are embedded in a metallic film. The Au SFTs accommodate an electronic state at their exposed surface that differs strongly from that of the surrounding Au(111) surface state. Au SFTs therefore reveal a very different electronic behaviour than previously investigated Ag SFTs, which showed a lateral quantization effect of the Ag(111) surface state without a clear decoupling from the surrounding Ag(111) substrate. This remarkable difference highlights the rich and diverse electronic properties of SFTs, which appear to strongly depend on the material.

Recent empirical evidence suggests that the LBS-based shape descriptor provides a discriminative characterization of brain anatomy and offers state-of-the-art performance for a range of shape retrieval and segmentation applications. A collection of the descriptors of brain structures, known as the BrainPrint, can provide an accurate and holistic representation of brain morphology, and has been successfully applied to subject identification, sex and age prediction, brain asymmetry analysis, twin studies, and computer-aided diagnosis of dementia.

[Context] The mitochondrial F1FO-ATP synthase, which includes three components (F1, FO and the peripheral stalk), is a critical mitochondrial OXPHOS enzyme involved in the regulation of mitochondrial ATP production and in the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. The F1FO-ATP synthase can both synthesize ATP and degrade ATP when operating in reverse to generate proton backflow, increasing mitochondrial membrane potential when it is critically low. In addition to its vital function in mitochondrial OXPHOS, recent studies have shown that this enzyme contributes to the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) through the interaction of its oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP) subunit with cyclophilin D (CypD), the key regulator of mPTP. Extensive formation of mPTP is a severe mitochondrial pathological event that leads to collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential (mΔΨ), decreased mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and, eventually, cell death. Indeed, mPTP activation is thought to be a key mechanism of mitochondrial stress in AD and has been proposed to underlie its characteristic synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline. Given its role in mitochondrial OXPHOS and mPTP formation, the deregulation of mitochondrial F1FO-ATP synthase may predispose to compromised OXPHOS efficiency and sensitized mPTP formation, which are two hallmark mitochondrial defects in AD. However, to date information on the dysfunction of F1FO-ATP synthase in AD has remained limited. Accordingly, the underlying molecular mechanisms causing the defect of this enzyme in AD remain unresolved.

[Context] Here we show that the combination of manganites and titanates in epitaxial heterostructures results in an exciting interfacial phenomenon. The titanate at the interface is doped as a result of a charge transfer process, and the Mn–O–Ti hybridized bonds offer a superexchange path for the magnetic coupling of Mn and Ti moments (see ). The different orbital occupation of Mn depending on layer thickness ratio allows controlling the sign of this coupling (ferro- vs antiferromagnetic).
[Question] How does the text state the magnetic moments of Mn and Ti can be coupled?
Choices:
1. The text states that Mn-O-Ti hybridized bonds at the interface offer a superexchange path that allows magnetic coupling of the Mn and Ti moments.
2. The different orbital occupation of Mn depending on the manganite/titanate layer thickness ratio allows control over whether the coupling is ferro- or antiferromagnetic.
3. The interfacial doping of the titanate and the ability to control the magnetic coupling between Mn and Ti makes this an exciting phenomenon.

[Question] Why was it suggested that HI-AcOH would be a good reducing agent to produce high-quality RG-O?
Choices:
1. It was assumed the reduction process would be possible at room temperature, especially for a plastic substrate with low glass transition temperature, because of facile vaporization of HI into G-O.
2. Hydriodic acid with acetic acid (HI-AcOH) has been reported to efficiently convert polycyclic quinones and phenols into their corresponding arenes in excellent yield.
3. It was suggested that HI-AcOH, with iodide as a catalyst, would replace the oxygen functional groups (epoxides and alcohols) in G-O with organohalides, which are good leaving groups. This would produce high-quality RG-O in both solution and gas phases.

[Context] On another research line, extensive progress has been made in the investigation of drop impact with another liquid body, either drop, bath or film. Lord Rayleigh first reported the interactions between two colliding streams of droplets. A droplet bouncing on a liquid surface has been elegantly shown to exhibit quantum-like properties, including double-slit interference, tunnelling and energy quantization. Now, it is generally accepted that the air layer entrapped between the impinging droplet and underlying liquid plays an important role in modulating the outcome of droplet impact, though it is susceptible to rupture at high-impacting velocity. To sustain a stable air layer and exert a lubrication force for bouncing promotion, external vibration has been used. In most studies, the liquid layer is deep and the bouncing is limited to very low-impacting velocity. Recently, Gilet and Bush performed a comprehensive study on the bouncing, splitting and merging dynamics of a silicone oil droplet on an inclined thin oil film with very large viscosity. Under proper condition, the droplet was found to rebound completely. Similarly, de Ruiter et al. also reported that a liquid droplet even bounces off from the flat hydrophilic solid surface with the aid of thin air cushion, whose evolution during droplet impact was studied with the reflection interference contrast microscopy (RICM). It is interesting to treat the solid substrate as a thin liquid film with the viscosity close to infinity. Despite significant progress on the air layer entrapment dynamics, it remains elusive that how and to what extent the liquid substrate can modulate the bouncing behaviour of an impinging droplet.

[Context] Having single-cell resolution is especially useful for the analysis of intra-tumor heterogeneity. This is due to the central role that mutational heterogeneity and subclonal tumor composition play in the failure of targeted cancer therapies, where resistant subclones can initiate tumor recurrence. Presently, genetic analyses of tumors are mostly based on sequencing bulk samples which only provides admixed variant allele frequency profiles of many thousands to millions of cells. These aggregate measurements are, however, only of limited use for the inference of subclonal genotypes and their phylogenetic relationships.

The drawbacks of current gold markers can reduce accuracy and introduce uncertainty in treatment. An ideal CT contrast agent that overcomes these issues would significantly improve tumor visualization, treatment planning, dose delivery, and reduce side effects. This would advance IGRT technology and improve outcomes for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.
2. Current gold-based fiducial markers often lead to side effects like inflammation, swelling, bleeding, and position shifts. Since they permanently stay in the body, they can negatively impact prognosis and management. They also generate streak artifacts in CT images which hinder visibility of surrounding tissues, affecting accuracy of dose calculation and treatment planning.
3. IGRT relies on accurate positioning of lesions throughout radiotherapy. An ideal CT contrast agent could act as a fiducial marker to enable tumor tracking and alignment of radiation beams. This is needed because tumors can shift location during treatment due to factors like respiratory motion and organ filling changes. The contrast agent should overcome issues with current gold fiducial markers, such as inflammation, bleeding, and position shifting. It should also minimize streak artifacts in CT images to improve visibility of surrounding tissues for treatment planning.
4. An ideal CT contrast agent should maximize the absolute CT attenuation difference between the tissue of interest and the surroundings using minimal doses.

[Context] This is a well recognized challenge. The variety of ways to increase throughput has been suggested over the years. Parallel manufacturing using several focal points seems as an attractive solution. However, in order to implement spatial light modulator (SLM) severe modifications to optical chain have to be performed. Furthermore, all focal points are confined to the working area of an objective, which is rather small for high numerical aperture (NA) objectives (from hundred to several hundreds μm). Thus, only arrays of small and identical objects can be made this way, lessening one of the main selling points of 3DLL - the flexibility of manufacturing. Alternatively, the shape of the voxel can be manipulated. This can be achieved with advanced spatial or spatiotemporal manipulations of the beam or choosing the objective with appropriate NA. While the first solution is rather complicated, the second one was applied successfully in various works when bigger voxel is advantageous. Nevertheless, increasing voxel size is still insufficient in most cases. Fast sample scanning is also required. Due to inherently slow movement or substantial inertia, piezo and linear stages cannot provide it. Scanners, based on freely addressable galvanometrically actuated mirrors, seem as the superb solution due to low nominal inertia, allowing to achieve cm/s translation velocities even when fabricating complex shapes. The problem with scanners lies in limitation induced by the working field of an objective used. A lot of structures with practical potential usage are in meso-scale, making them bigger than the working field of the objective. Therefore, the necessity to print objects segment-by-segment arises, leading to the mechanically and optically detrimental “stitching”. Hence, scanners are also insufficient to meet all necessities posed by the advances in the field.

[Context] In this study, to explore the relation between TET loss-of-function and cancer, we generated mice homozygous for a germline deletion of Tet2 and a conditional allele of Tet3. Our goal was not to model a human disease, since TET3-coding region mutations are relatively rare in humans. Rather, we wished to examine the relation of TET loss-of-function to oncogenesis, using a mouse model in which a profound loss of TET function could be acutely induced in vivo. We show here that Tet2 mice acutely deleted for Tet3 displayed a rapid, progressive leukocytosis with neutrophilia, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia and severe anaemia, which developed within a few weeks into a highly aggressive myeloid leukaemia in 100% of the mice. Transcriptional profiling revealed aberrant lineage priming in HSPC, coupled to impaired erythroid and lymphoid differentiation and marked skewing towards the myeloid lineage. These changes in gene transcription were not strongly linked to changes in DNA methylation. Bone marrow chimera and splenocyte transfer experiments indicated that the myeloid leukaemia was induced in a cell-autonomous manner and was transplantable to secondary recipient mice. Myeloid progenitors and mature myeloid-lineage cells acutely deleted for TET function progressively accumulated DNA damage and showed strong impairment of DNA damage responses and DNA break repair. Our data indicate that TET loss-of-function accelerates myeloid leukaemogenesis, through mechanisms that involve lineage dysregulation, uncontrolled expansion and genomic instability in differentiating cells.

[Context] DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the most dangerous form of DNA damage. Unrepaired breaks lead to cell death, while improperly repaired breaks cause an increase in genomic instability and, in humans, diseases such as cancer and premature aging. There are two major pathways to repair DSBs. non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). NHEJ consists of a ligation of two DNA ends without using homology. In HR, a homologous sequence is used as an information donor in a highly regulated mechanism. Several recombination subpathways have been described, each one with distinct outcomes and consequences. The choice between these two repair mechanisms is highly regulated, and changes in the ratio between them can increase genomic instability. So far, the best-known regulated step of the DSB repair pathway choice is the so-called DNA end resection. Here strands are degraded 5′–3′ at each DNA end, giving rise to ssDNA tails that are immediately coated by the replication protein A (RPA) complex for protection. RPA-coated ssDNA is an obligatory substrate of HR and hampers NHEJ. A major player in the choice between NHEJ and HR is CtIP (CtBP interacting protein), which licenses HR by activating DNA end resection. Multiple signals converge on CtIP to initiate DNA end resection at those breaks that will be repaired by HR. In order to find and characterize new factors involved in this crucial choice, we took advantage of the SeeSaw Reporter (SSR), a system designed to assess the balance between NHEJ and HR. Using a genome-wide human esiRNA library, we found that downregulation of 1.35% of the genes shifts the NHEJ. HR ratio towards NHEJ, while depletion of a further 0.71% has the opposite effect. We focused on CCAR2, which we found to cause hyper-recombination when depleted. We show that it acts as an inhibitor of recombination. Specifically, we found that CCAR2 inhibits initiation and limits the extent of DNA end resection through its functional interaction with CtIP. This regulation of DNA end processing modulates the choice between NHEJ and HR.
[Question] How does CtIP regulate the choice between NHEJ and HR?
Choices:
1. DNA end resection is the process of degrading the 5' to 3' strands at the ends of a DNA break, leaving 3' single-stranded DNA tails. These ssDNA tails are coated by RPA and promote HR while inhibiting NHEJ. Therefore, DNA end resection helps determine whether a DNA break will be repaired by NHEJ or HR.
2. CtIP promotes HR repair by activating DNA end resection. It ""licenses"" HR repair by initiating the resection of DNA ends, which generates the RPA-coated ssDNA tails that promote HR over NHEJ. Therefore, CtIP activity helps determine whether DSBs will be repaired by HR versus NHEJ.
3. The two major pathways for repairing DNA double-strand breaks are non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). NHEJ involves ligating the two broken DNA ends together without using any homology. HR uses homologous sequences as a template to repair the break in a regulated mechanism.
4. The authors used an esiRNA library to systematically knockdown genes and looked for effects on the SeeSaw Reporter, which assesses the balance between HR and NHEJ repair. Knockdowns shifting the balance toward more NHEJ or more HR implicated those genes in repair pathway choice. This allowed them to identify CCAR2 as a new factor that regulates the balance between HR and NHEJ.

The influence of diffractive multifocal IOLs was evaluated using several perimetries, such as frequent doubling technology, Octopus, Goldmann manual perimetry, and Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA. Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). Some of these approaches demonstrated depressions of the hill of vision due to diffractive multifocal IOLs, while the others did not show the depressions. Recently, Aychoua et al. assessed the mean deviation (MD) and mean sensitivity (MS) of eyes after the implantation of diffractive multifocal and monofocal IOLs, and these parameters were measured in standard automated perimetry (SAP) using HFA with the Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) standard threshold test algorithm under a 30–2 grid. The results revealed that eyes with multifocal IOLs exhibited lower values. Similar results were obtained in the analysis using a 10–2 grid. Although it is still unknown why the perimetry results are altered, a loss of light and a disturbed PSF inherent in diffractive multifocal IOLs are considered as the causative factors. The previous findings suggested a risk of further reduction in contrast sensitivity. Thus, it is usually inadvisable to implant multifocal IOLs for glaucomatous eyes.

We demonstrate that this model can accurately and sensitively extract anomalous signal from single-crystal, monochromatic diffraction at a synchrotron, time-resolved signal from single-crystal, polychromatic diffraction at a synchrotron, and anomalous signal from a serial femtosecond experiment at an XFEL. Our analyses show that this single model can implicitly account for the physical parameters of diffraction experiments with performance competitive with domain-specific, state-of-the-art analysis methods. Although we focus on X-ray diffraction, we believe the same principles can be applied to any diffraction experiment.

[Context] In vivo examination of specific thalamocortical network disturbances in schizophrenia became possible with the advent of connectivity-based segmentation methods that delineate subdivisions of the thalamus based on their pattern of cortical connectivity. Conventionally, the cortex is parcellated into large cortical regions of interest (ROIs) that broadly correspond to the primary targets of specific thalamic nuclei, as detailed in animal studies. Each thalamic voxel is then singularly associated with one of these anatomically defined ROIs to which it is most strongly connected, and specific thalamocortical networks are localized within the resultant thalamic subdivisions that resemble thalamic nuclei identified from histological studies. In the schizophrenia literature, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies employing these methods have reported consistent patterns of thalamocortical network abnormalities involving the mediodorsal (MD) nuclei in association with decreased connectivity between frontal ROIs and the thalamus, as well as the ventrolateral (VL) and ventroposterior (VP) nuclei with increased connectivity between motor- and sensory-related ROIs and the thalamus in chronic and early psychosis patients.

[Context] Biodegradation of plastic waste is an economically cheaper process, more efficient than any other conventional methods of plastic waste disposal. Similarly, the secondary products of biodegradation may exhibit economic value rather than incineration and landfill. Biodegradation is a complex process involves steps including biodeterioration, depolymerization and mineralization. Hence, the biological agent utilizes the synthetic polymer as a substrate for carbon source, thus the end-product would be microbial biomass.
[Question] Why can the end products of biodegradation be economically valuable?
Choices:
1. Incineration involves burning plastic at high temperatures which releases greenhouse gases. Landfill involves burying plastic which takes long to break down. Biodegradation utilizes microbes to naturally break down plastics into harmless end products and new microbial biomass which carries economic value.
2. The end products of biodegradation are microbial biomass and minerals, which can have economic value. The microbial biomass can potentially be used in agricultural or industrial processes. The mineralization products like carbon dioxide and mineral salts can be harvested and utilized. This provides economic incentive compared to disposing plastic waste through incineration or landfilling which does not produce valuable end products.

So far, most efforts focus on tuning the concentration of Al as the main route to increase the Brønsted acidity on zeolites or silica-alumina. However, Al species tend to condense, to form an alumina phase at high Al/Si ratios, leading to the decrease of Brønsted acidity. For ASA containing solely BASs based on Al species (BAS-Al), the maximum Brønsted acidity has been obtained at 30 wt% Al loading. In spite of the different BAS models, only Al species have been experimentally confirmed to contribute to the formation of BASs in these catalysts. Al and Al species have been shown to act as Lewis acid sites on ASA and zeolites, but, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental evidence of BASs involving these sites has been reported so far.

[Context] A typical strategy for realizing the STDP in a neuromorphic circuit is to deploy two leaky integrators for pre and postsynaptic state variables (s. pre and s. post) in conjunction with an analog or digital memory unit to store the evaluated synaptic weight. This general framework has been applied to various synaptic circuit designs thus far. a good review is given by Bamford et al. Table  summarizes several previous STDP circuits that are capable of real-time scale operation. Notably, the state variables are often realized by (i) leaky voltage integrators using a standalone capacitor or the gate capacitor of a transistor (switched-capacitor integrators), (ii) current-starved inverter, and (iii) operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-based integrator. Scaling down a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) in the integrator (particularly channel length below 100 nm) causes a significant rise in subthreshold leakage current, and thus a large decrease in the relaxation time of the integrator with a given capacitor. For temporal learning, the relaxation time is a priori preferred to be comparable to that of the biological counterpart in favor of energy-efficient learning, sacrificing unnecessarily fast response. In this regard, needs for higher capacitance to compensate for the subthreshold leakage—maintaining the biologically plausible relaxation time—perhaps limit further scaling down. A workaround is to adopt digital technologies as done by Vogelstein et al. a random access memory (RAM) was deployed to store discrete state variable values, and their updates were evaluated in a programmable manner using a microcontroller unit (MCU). Upon every spiking event, the MCU scans the entire RAM and updates the synaptic weights according to the STDP rule. As such, this digital implementation readily offers flexibility in designing the STDP model, hence can serve as a convenient platform in combination with hardware neurons. A possible disadvantage is, however, such that the weight values in the RAM are updated in serial order (time consuming), which hinders a large network with a number of connections (synapses) from real-time interaction with physical environments.
[Question] Why does scaling down MOSFET channel length cause problems for integrator-based STDP circuits?
Choices:
1. Scaling down the channel length of MOSFETs used in integrators for STDP below 100 nm causes a significant rise in subthreshold leakage current, which leads to a large decrease in the relaxation time of the integrator for a given capacitor.
2. The text explains that scaling down the channel length of MOSFETs below 100 nm in an integrator causes a significant rise in subthreshold leakage current. This leads to a large decrease in the relaxation time of the integrator for a given capacitor. Since a biologically plausible relaxation time is preferred for temporal learning and energy efficiency, the increased leakage limits further scaling down of the MOSFET channel length.
3. The state variables in neuromorphic STDP circuits typically include separate variables s.pre and s.post to represent pre- and postsynaptic neuronal activity respectively. Their relative values are used to evaluate synaptic weight changes according to the STDP learning rule.
4. A workaround is to use digital technologies, like deploying a RAM to store discrete state variable values and using a MCU to update them, instead of using analog integrators. This avoids the leakage issue but can be slower for large networks.

[Context] Previous work determined one common evolutionary tendency in microbial parasites known as genome reduction or genome decay. Current studies indicate that—when a microorganism abandons its free-living lifestyle to become an intracellular parasite (or an endosymbiont)—its genome undergoes a slow but startling metamorphosis over a period of millions of years. In a process known as genome decay, microbial parasites accumulate deleterious mutations that transform many formerly essential genes into pseudogenes, leading to gradual gene loss and mutational meltdown. This meltdown can eliminate up to ∼95% of genes in the most ancient intracellular organisms compared to closely related free-living species. Thus, the evolution of intracellular parasites involves a tug of war of two opposing forces—with Darwinian natural selection pushing parasites to improve, and genome decay pushing parasites to fade into oblivion. How successful parasites emerge from this tug of war, preserving the activity of their molecular structures, remains unclear.

[Context] Understanding individual as well as population performance of copepods at the molecular level is the key to gaining insights into the mechanisms regulating their growth and development, physiological functions and response to the environmental changes. In recent years, an increasing number of transcriptomic studies have been conducted with copepods at different growth stages, fed with different algae and exposed to different stressors. These studies are revealing genes involved in the sexual differentiation, development, metabolism and molecular markers in copepods. Despite the increasing data generated by various molecular approaches, transcriptomic studies on copepods still face several challenges. First, with currently available methodologies, it is impossible to separate transcripts of copepods from those of symbiotic or parasitic organisms on or under the chitinous skeleton and appendages of copepods, such as ciliates, fungi, diatoms, dinoflagellates, as well as prey organisms in the gut. Second, field-collected copepod individuals often need to be brought to the laboratory for sorting, species identification and rearing, making transcriptomic data obtained from these individuals not representative of the in situ gene expression in the natural assemblages. Third, as most copepods are very small in size (0.5–2 mm), great effort is required to obtain enough starting material for transcriptomic profiling of wild-caught samples (usually several micrograms of total RNA are required).

[Context] In this article, we demonstrate the transfer of imaging information along a fibre-based optical system.The image is neither separated into guiding channels in situ nor periodically repeated within an optical system but it is transmitted within a single-core multimode waveguide and reconstructed ex situ behind the fibre using the principles of digital holography.Crucially, by utilizing a multimode waveguide, the equivalent image information is relayed through a physical system with a cross-section one order of magnitude narrower than is possible with other available techniques.The results we present offer several approaches to exploit multimode waveguides for imaging.we demonstrate a geometry for bright- and dark-field microscopy for monochromatic light as well as fluorescent imaging where the excitation wavelength is delivered in situ by the very same waveguide that also collects the fluorescence signal.Even though the geometries are based on different principles, our implementations allow image capture at very high frame rates in both cases, exceeding previously reported approaches by several orders of magnitude.Furthermore, we show the controlled generation of complex light fields such as Laguerre–Gaussian modes, 'bottle' beams and propagation-invariant beams through a multimode fibre.This opens up prospects for fibre-based versions of techniques such as stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) or light sheet imaging.Based on the demonstrated results, we contend that our methodology paves the way for inexpensive 'lensless' imaging systems with diffraction-limited spatial resolution, minimal collateral damage and flexibility for use at various imaging depths or working distances..

[Context] To date, reliable and efficient isolation of viable CTC clusters has been limited because the sensitivity and specificity of CTC isolation technologies are primarily calibrated for single cell detection.Microfiltration techniques, for example, are widely employed as CTC assays due to their fast and straightforward operation.However, CTC clusters under physiological pressure can reorganize themselves as single-file chain-like structures and traverse constrictions as small as 5 μm, which suggests that aggregates can likely pass through filter pores, given the much higher pressures employed in filtration.Moreover, higher shear forces experienced during microfiltration could damage CTC clusters or dissociate them into single cells, undermining efficient enrichment.On the other hand, antibody-based enrichment systems, which have long been used for isolation of single CTCs, can only detect a select sub-population of CTC clusters within the heterogenous CTC population due to their dependency on specific membrane antigens.Additionally, the smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio of CTC clusters negatively impacts the immunocapture efficiencies of antibody-based technologies, rendering them particularly inefficient for CTC cluster enrichment.More promising in this regard are recent microfluidic chips specifically targeting CTC clusters, which can achieve relatively higher sensitivities.Unfortunately, they do so either at clinically unworkable processing rates or under threat of cluster damage due to the high flow rates in narrow channels,—a concern especially relevant for large clusters, which were reported to be occasionally comprised of as many as tens of tumor cells..

We further characterize the functional consequences of acetylation on protein-membrane interactions using biophysical analysis of recombinant proteins as well as cellular and animal model approaches that utilize acetylation-mimicking mutations to study candidates from our bioinformatics analysis. Our data reveal that acetylation is significantly more prevalent in regions directly involved in membrane interactions compared to regions in the same domains that do not interact with membranes.

Tim4 is a type I transmembrane protein expressed on macrophages, which strongly binds phosphatidylserine, displayed not only on apoptotic cells but also on exosomes and microvesicles. We employed the extracellular region of Tim4 immobilized on magnetic beads to capture sEVs from various pre-cleared cell conditioned media and biofluids. As Tim4-binding to phosphatidylserine is Ca-dependent, intact sEVs can be easily released by adding a buffer containing a chelating agent. Most notably, sEVs isolated by our Tim4-affinity purification method were much purer than those isolated using conventional methods, containing fewer non-sEV contaminants as revealed by mass spectrometry. Capturing EVs with Tim4 protein was also used for isolation of large EVs from 10,000× g pellet of cell conditioned media (10K pellet) and sensitive quantification of EVs by ELISA and flow cytometry. These results establish the usefulness of purification via Tim4 protein in characterization of the bona fide functions of EVs.

To define what is an important element in the signaling flow, we used the graph theory based term ‘criticality’. In graph theory a critical node is known as a vertex, whose removal results in the dissociation of the original graph to multiple subgraphs or the disconnection between source vertices (i. e. those vertices, which have outgoing edges only) and sink vertices (i. e. vertices having incoming edges only). We built our analysis on the latter definition and adapted it for signaling pathways, thereby identifying source nodes as ligands, and sink nodes as transcription factors (TFs), and connections between them as directed tissue-specific paths from ligands to TFs.

The polysaccharide usually contains the units of glucans and/or mannans, which can be recognized by macrophage carbohydrate receptors including TLRs and c-type lectins. The hydrophilic polysaccharide chains are often attached with hydrophobic, aliphatic groups, which play vital roles in exerting immunoactivity. Also, the size of the signaling structure is crucial for its bioactivity, and one in branched or particulate forms is often more potent than the same carbohydrate in linear or soluble form. Therefore, we hypothesize that a glucomannan (GM) polysaccharide modified with acetyl groups (acGM) represents the essential, PAMP-mimicking structure to generate macrophages with anti-tumor activities. In this design, GM offers repeating units of glucose and mannose, and acetylation adds the simplest possible aliphatic group to the sugar ring.

[Context] Most of the aforementioned compact microscope devices are optimized for stained dead cell analysis. These devices are exempt from the requirement of a dedicated environment with stable humility, temperature and CO2 concentration, which is necessary for long-term live cell observation. However, observing changes in live cells over a period of time, known as time-lapse or longitudinal microscopy, is essential to a variety of cell biology research areas. Examples of its uses include aiding in drug screening, visualizing cell apoptotic processes, analyzing cell division phenotypes and investigating gene function by RNA interference. Currently, the dominating method to create a stable and suitable environment for cellular growth while concurrently observing the cells is to build a customized incubator on an existing microscope due to the infeasibility of bringing the bulky microscope into a CO2 incubator. Aside from the cumbersome form factor, the conventional incubator-on-microscope modality requires considerable expense due to the necessity of the special incubator. Meanwhile, time-lapse imaging of cell culture has an intrinsic need for wide FOV, to track a larger population of cells for better statistical analysis over extended periods of time. In contrast, the conventional microscopes frequently used for housing the incubator and accommodating the cell culture typically has a minimum magnifying power of two, which causes a limited FOV no larger than 40 mm in the acquired digital images. Image stitching techniques are usually employed in this case, to stitch multiple small frames into a single big one, to achieve sufficiently large FOV. For this method, any failed image necessitates repetition of the entire acquisition, requiring 100% reliability for each frame captured during the observation period. Moreover, the system needs to be equipped with additional high precision motorized parts, adding to the complexity of the system.

Unfortunately, ion transport in modern LIBs relies on flammable liquid electrolytes, which are culpable for the majority of recent catastrophic battery fires. Developing solid electrolyte materials is critical to meet the performance demands of modern LIBs while providing requisite increases in mechanical stability, thermal stability, and safety. As applications for batteries for wearable and conformable electronics continue to emerge, the growing intimacy between batteries and the human body exacerbates the need for improved robustness. The development of solid electrolyte materials for batteries requires creation of materials that are both highly ionically conductive and mechanically robust.

[Context] Hsp70 is composed of three domains. a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), a substrate-binding domain (SBD) and a C-terminal domain (CTD). The NBD exhibits ATPase activity that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, and the SBD accommodates the peptides of substrate proteins. The structure of Hsp70 is highly dynamic and is dependent on ADP/ATP binding. When ADP binds to the NBD, the NBD interacts only minimally with the SBD, and peptides are able to be tightly bound to the SBD. When ATP binds to the NBD, an extensive NBD surface interacts with the SBD, and peptides can rapidly bind to and be released from the SBD. These conformational changes in Hsp70 enable the allosteric mechanisms that transfer the energetic tension from the ATP-bound NBD to the SBD. Therefore, the allosteric regulation of Hsp70 is indispensable for its proper function. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the allostery of Hsp70 are also unknown.

[Context] The dynamic, rotationally disordered behavior of the sulfate anions in α-Li2SO4 was later confirmed by neutron diffraction. These measurements suggested that oxygen from the SO4 tetrahedra was spherically disordered around the central sulfur. Similarly, single-crystal diffraction subsequently revealed that Li was evenly distributed in a spherical shell surrounding the anions. These observations were consistent with the larger unit cell volume in α-Li2SO4 compared with its low-temperature analog, with the additional volume believed to facilitate anion rotations. Börjesson and Torell measured the activation energies for anion rotation and lithium diffusion in α-Li2SO4, and found that they were very similar, 0.40 and 0.34 eV, respectively. Taken together, these studies imply a strong dynamic coupling between the rotational motion of the SO4 anions and the translational motion of the Li cations, i. e., a “paddlewheel” mechanism.

[Context] In this work, we measure the I–V curves and PL decays of InGaP and GaAs subcells in ten triple-junction solar cells before and after irradiation with electrons. Inverted grown (growth from top to bottom) triple-junction solar cells with conversion efficiencies of about 30% have been used. From the power dependence of the PL decays, we obtain the optical time constants for recombination in flat-band condition and charge separation in short-circuit and also the point of maximum power. By comparing the optically obtained time constants and electrical parameters, it is shown that our optical method allows to predict the absolute electrical conversion efficiency of the device with an accuracy of better than 5%. Since the carrier dynamics have been measured directly in each subcell, we can discuss the influence of radiation on the current generation process. We find that the recombination losses increased in both InGaP and GaAs subcells due to the electron irradiation. However, due to the high internal electric fields in the InGaP subcell, the material degradation of the InGaP subcell has only a weak influence on the entire device performance at the point of maximum power.
[Question] Why did the material degradation of the InGaP subcell only weakly influence the entire device performance at maximum power?

[Context] The use of folding to control pre-straining of polymer sheets has been examined in previous research. Ryu et al. manufactured a locally pre-strained polymer sheet and illuminated the polymer sheet to make it deform to a specific folded shape. While direct design of polymer sheets has various advantages, such as control of the material characteristics and geometric shape, the manufacture of locally pre-strained polymer sheets requires considerable skill and dexterity. In contrast, PS sheets with line patterns can be manufactured easily by anyone who can use a desktop printer, so PS sheets with line patterns can be produced more readily than locally pre-strained sheets. Accordingly, PS sheets with line patterns were employed in this study to examine the light-activated self-folding technique. Furthermore, using combinations of folds, self-folding origami structures can be developed. Self-folding origami structures such as octahedrons and icosahedrons can be designed by varying the line patterns printed on planar PS sheets. However, a PS sheet might not be deformed to the intended shape, because its folding behaviour is based on the thermal contraction of the polymer material and the instability of this deformation behaviour makes it difficult to produce the intended shapes precisely. As an alternative, collar faces are considered. A collar face is an additional face attached at the edge line of the PS sheet. When a PS sheet with many line patterns is folded, the collar face is in contact with the other faces. Through this process, the collar face prevents excessive folding deformation, which makes the PS sheet maintain the desired folding angle. In addition, to prevent collisions between collar faces, the sheets are sequentially folded. The light absorption of a PS sheet is controlled by changing the degree of transparency of the line pattern, so sequential folding can be achieved through control of the degree of transparency of the line pattern.

In the mid-infrared range, perovskite oxides show phonon resonances, which are located at slightly different wavelengths for related materials such as, for example, bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) and strontium titanate (SrTiO3).

[Context] Loss of APC is the earliest genetic event during colorectal carcinogenesis, but established colorectal cancer cells still retain dependency on Wnt signalling. Numerous attempts have therefore been made to develop therapeutics targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In colorectal cancer, however, due to the genetic inactivation of APC, only the molecules downstream of APC can be considered as therapeutic targets. TNIK was identified independently by two research groups through comprehensive mass-spectrometry analyses of proteins associated with the T-cell factor-4 (TCF4) and β-catenin transcriptional complex, the most downstream effector of Wnt signalling. TNIK was essential for full activation of Wnt signalling, and colorectal cancer cells were highly dependent on TNIK for growth. On the basis of these results, TNIK has been considered a promising drug target.

[Context] It has been suggested that effective tumor control by PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy is due to the release of immune-suppressive signaling in T cells. A sufficient number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has reportedly been correlated with a better response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. However, even in the presence of heavy lymphocyte infiltration, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy alone might not be effective to (re-)activate tumor-specific T cells.

[Context] Mutations in human Group II CCT subunits 4 and 5 cause rare debilitating diseases. For example, the His147Arg mutation in human CCT5 causes mutilating peripheral sensory neuropathy. Little is known concerning the pathogenic mechanisms of these CCT mutations at the molecular level and on the impact of the mutations upon the structure and function of the complex. Mutations that allow survival of the carriers are likely to have very subtle mechanistic deficits since major functional disruption would be lethal due to the critical and multiple roles of this ubiquitous chaperone. Therefore, pathogenic mutations with living phenotypes have to be considered a priori difficult to characterize at the molecular level with the systems available today. Ways must be found to amplify a defect to make it measurable. For this purpose, we focused on modeling the CCT5 mutation, using the Cpn60 from Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf), which has only one subunit homolog that assembles into a hexadecameric double-ring complex like the human counterpart.
[Question] Why is little known about the molecular mechanisms of pathogenic CCT mutations?

While all resonators within an array are interconnected via two metal levels, each resonator is designed with a distinct resonance frequency which becomes its individual address. NEMS within an array operate in multi-mode and retain the same mass resolution as a single resonator. Using such an array, mass spectra of metallic aggregates have been acquired with excellent speed due to a significantly enhanced capture cross-section compared to individual resonators. Spectra acquired with a conventional time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer in the same system show excellent agreement. As individual information for each resonator within the array is retained, we demonstrate spatial imaging of a particle beam at the single-particle level.

1. This array allows individual addressing of each resonator within the array, while maintaining the same number of inputs/outputs as a single resonator. Previous arrays required separate inputs/outputs for each resonator.

Choices:
1. The CRISPR-Cas system consists of two main components - the Cas protein, which acts as the enzyme that cuts the DNA, and the guide RNA (gRNA), which guides the Cas protein to the specific sequence in the genome that needs to be edited. By delivering the Cas protein and gRNA into a cell, the Cas protein can make a double stranded break at the targeted sequence specified by the gRNA. This break can then be repaired through non-homologous end joining or homology directed repair, resulting in edits to the DNA sequence.

[Context] Biological invasions create an ideal experiment for elucidating the potential trajectories of regional changes in species co-distribution. Introduced species need to cross a series of filters to become naturalized and invasive, forming an introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum, hereafter INIC. The stochastic component of ‘random’ introduction is gradually diminished through multiple dispersal and environmental filters, with the remnant species emerging as ‘winners’. These filters thus define the direction in both human-mediated and natural selections—towards better performance in novel environments. Categorizing species at the same trophic level according to their residence time into regional assemblages of different ages and then examining the structural differences between these assemblages may capture the signal of the regional structural changes. Although these species with different residence times do interact, the role of interspecific interactions within a single trophic level at the regional scales is relatively trivial compared with top–down regional processes—driven specifically by habitat suitability and dispersal barriers—in regulating locally unsaturated assemblages. Consequently, the co-distribution of species in multiple sites resembles a bipartite resource–consumer network (for example, a host–parasitoid network), with species as consumers and sites as resource providers.
[Question] How can examining assemblages of species at the same trophic level but with different residence times help understand regional structural changes?
Choices:
1. Categorizing species by their different residence times creates assemblages of different ages. Comparing the structure of these assemblages of different ages captures signals of regional structural changes over time.
2. The co-distribution of species across multiple sites can be modeled as a bipartite resource-consumer network, with species as consumers and sites as resource providers. This resembles a host-parasitoid network.
3. At regional scales, top-down processes driven by habitat suitability and dispersal barriers play a bigger role in shaping locally unsaturated assemblages than interspecific interactions within a single trophic level.
4. The INIC represents the series of filters an introduced species needs to pass through to become naturalized and invasive. The stochastic component of random introduction is gradually reduced through these filters, resulting in the ""winners"" that emerge and perform well in the novel environment.

[Context] Here we successfully engineered yeast for the targeted production of VLCFAs and derived products thereof. As a first approach, we selectively modified the endogenous yeast FA elongation system to specifically control the chain length of VLCFAs. In a parallel approach, we demonstrated that the FAS I system from Mycobacterium vaccae can be functionally expressed in yeast generating a bimodal product distribution of C16–18 and C22–24 VLCFAs. Combining these two strategies, we could selectively produce VLCFAs ranging from C22 to C26 in chain length. Then, we further extended the metabolic pathways by expressing a C22-specific VLCFA reductase for the production of docosanol. To relieve the competition for VLCFAs between product formation and cell growth-associated processes, we implemented a dynamic control strategy for dividing the production phase and cell growth phase, which increased the docosanol production almost four-fold. Ultimately, by (re)constructing the whole pathway under this dynamic control, together with further enhancing the yeast elongation system, mycobacterial FAS I system and the precursor supply, we enabled a docosanol production of 83.5 mg l, an almost 80-fold improvement compared with the initial proof-of-concept strain. Our results show that the FA metabolism can be engineered for the production of VLCFA-derived chemicals in yeast. Furthermore, for the first time the mycobacterial FAS I system was successfully expressed in yeast for controlling the VLCFA chain length, representing a new and feasible strategy for targeted high-level production of VLCFAs and derived products ().
[Question] What additional metabolic engineering strategies did the authors use to increase production of the VLCFA-derived product docosanol?
Choices:
1. To increase docosanol production, the authors expressed a C22-specific VLCFA reductase to convert VLCFAs to docosanol. They also implemented a dynamic control strategy to divide the production and cell growth phases, relieving competition for VLCFAs. This increased docosanol production approximately 4-fold.
2. By combining the modified endogenous yeast elongation system and the mycobacterial FAS I system, the authors were able to selectively produce VLCFAs ranging from C22 to C26 in chain length. The yeast elongation system allowed control of longer chain lengths, while the mycobacterial system generated C22-C24 VLCFAs.
3. Key achievements included: 1) Producing VLCFAs in yeast with chain lengths from C22 to C26 by combining modified yeast elongation and mycobacterial FAS I systems; 2) Expressing a VLCFA reductase to produce the VLCFA-derived product docosanol; 3) Increasing docosanol production by ~80-fold to 83.5 mg/L through metabolic engineering strategies. This demonstrated feasibility of producing VLCFA-derived chemicals in yeast.

[Context] Relationship between microstructure and properties is the key issue in materials science. Dispersion strengthening is of great importance in enhancing mechanical properties of engineering alloys, in which small particles of second phase (usually with complex crystal structure) play a critical role in resisting dislocation motion in the matrix. Al2Cu intermetallic particles offer dispersion strengthening in Al-Cu alloys in which the presence of Al2Cu is able to block dislocations motion and consequently harden the materials. Therefore, the higher concentration of Al2Cu particles offer, the higher hardness of the alloy has. However, in the past decades, more and more experimental observations indicate that the small-sized second phase can be decomposed during plastic deformation, leading to degradation of material properties. Such a decomposition of the strengthening particles under mechanical loading may unavoidably lead to a detrimental consequence. The intrinsic mechanism of deformation-induced destabilization of complex compounds in some materials has been debated for decades, in which dislocation behaviors received great concerns.
[Question] What is dispersion strengthening and why is it important?
[Answer] ","Dispersion strengthening involves adding small particles of a second phase to strengthen and harden an alloy. It is important because the small particles act to obstruct dislocation motion in the matrix phase.

[Context] However, like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, verifying the number of layers in few-layer MX structures is crucial when they are used as device materials. In stacking a layer, we average the length of all similar direction bonding. While MX has attracted great interest, verifying the number of layers of MX sample has not yet been sufficiently studied. For example, there has only been one case verifying the thickness of a sample using an electronic bandgap. that is a good method for figuring out the thickness. However, measuring a bandgap has too many more steps than Raman and can ruin an exfoliated crystal sample. Therefore, nondestructive Raman method might be the best method, but there are no relevant reference data. In this paper, we performed Raman simulation for MX as the number of layers varied from a monolayer to bulk in order to provide standard Raman spectroscopy data. We focus on SnS, SnSe, GeS, and GeSe as representative examples for MX. Our calculations show that the Raman spectroscopy for metal monochalcogenides depends on the number of layers. We found that the red shift and blue shift occur continuously as the number of layers increases by ~100 cm. This can be explained by the fact that the shifts come from the change of the bond lengths between the metal atoms and chalcogen atoms by the change of the interlayer interaction, leading to the slight modification of a vibration mode. These results provide benchmarks for determining the number of layers of metal monochalcogenides by Raman spectroscopy analysis.

For the study of metabolic processes that integrate information across cells and tissues, large screening strategies provide a successful alternative to assays of predefined targets, thanks to progress in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. In addition, proteomics is powerful enough to enable analysis of proteins from “exotic” organisms not or not well represented in protein databases. Using a high-throughput proteomics analytical strategy, our objective was therefore to identify plasma molecular indices of the physiological state that link spontaneous refeeding behaviour with fasting limits in Adélie penguins living under natural conditions.
[Question] When did the second capture and sampling occur?

[Context] In this respect, the development of cement-based composites by using carbonaceous fillers (i. e. Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs), Graphene and/or its derivatives) able to strengthen the structure of cement hydrated phases, and enabling the achievement of additional functionalities including the piezo-resistive properties useful for realizing strain sensors for the structural health monitoring of buildings, is a very topical issue, still to be fully explored. The enhancement of structural and functional properties of cement-based composites realizes when the nanometric filler is loaded at a defined concentration, i. e. the percolation threshold, which enables the formation of a continuous three-dimensional network throughout the cementitious matrix. The filler amount to get the percolation depends on the geometrical properties of the filler (i. e. shape, 1- or 2-dimensional nature of the filler, and aspect ratio) and, generally, the best improvements of structural and functional performances are observed for filler contents from 1 wt% (with respect to the cement fraction) up to several percentage units. Moreover, the peculiarities of cementitious-based composites strongly depend on the ability to homogeneously distribute the carbonaceous filler within the mortar and concrete volume, without destroying the integrity of the cement-based hydrated phase and avoiding any marked filler aggregation and/or separation. Furthermore, to obtain an improvement in the mechanical and functional properties of the resulting composites, it is required a good interaction at the carbonaceous filler-matrix interface. Generally, the strong tendency of these fillers to agglomerate due to the presence of attractive forces (e. g., Van der Waals), can hinder the positive effect of the filler. Thus, in order to control the distribution homogeneity of the carbonaceous fillers (carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and its derivatives) into organic or inorganic matrices, various methods have been proposed including physical techniques, such as ultrasonication, ball milling and mechanical stirring, or chemical methods, such as the use of surfactants, covalent functionalization of fillers or a combination of these methods.
[Question] What is required for the carbonaceous filler to enhance the structural and functional properties of cement-based composites?

[Context] Inspired by animal groupings, here we seek to understand how fluid-mediated interactions among self-propelling bodies influence their collective locomotion. Specifically, we study such interactions in the idealized setting of linear arrays of wings undergoing prescribed flapping motions but whose swimming speed is free or dynamically determined. Because the flows are inertial or long-lived, the forcing experienced by each body depends on the dynamical history of the ensemble, and the system can be said to possess memory of past states. We aim to understand how this effect is manifest in collective locomotion and to draw parallels to other fluid-structure systems that display memory. Understanding these interactions could also provide insight into the fluid dynamics of animal groups on the move, especially with regard to possible exploitation of flows for formation locomotion or highly ordered groupings. Moreover, the underlying hydrodynamic principles might be put to use in applications involving the interactions of bodies with unsteady flows.

In the metazoan germline, they play an important role in silencing transposable elements (TEs) and are thus critical for genome integrity. In Drosophila, piRNAs originate from the processing of piRNA precursors transcribed from discrete genomic regions called piRNA clusters. piRNA clusters are enriched in TEs or their vestiges. In Drosophila melanogaster, their size ranges from 1 to a few hundred kb and they are almost exclusively located within or in close proximity to heterochromatic regions. The ovarian somatic follicle cells preferentially express uni-strand piRNA clusters, transcribing one strand only. Current knowledge on piRNA cluster biology has been mostly acquired from studies conducted on flam locus, a uni-strand piRNA cluster active in the follicular cells. flam is transcribed by the RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) into a precursor that is similar to other RNA Pol II transcripts in basic RNA features.

The degree of fluorescence emission is proportional to the amount of RNA in the Ret, therefore the higher fluorescence emission the more immature subpopulation of Rets. Determination of Ret subpopulations may provide information on bone marrow erythropoietic activity and be also of use in monitoring the response to intravenous iron in sepsis patients.
[Question] Why can the monitoring of reticulocyte hemoglobin and reticulocyte subpopulations be useful in sepsis patients receiving intravenous iron therapy?
Choices:
1. Ret-He provides information on the functional availability of iron for erythropoiesis over the past 3-4 days, reflecting the lifespan of a reticulocyte. It normalizes quickly with iron therapy and so can be used to monitor the response.
2. In sepsis patients, traditional markers of iron deficiency like ferritin and transferrin are disrupted. Reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent and subpopulations provide alternative measures of iron availability and erythropoietic response that are not impacted by the acute phase response in sepsis. Their rapid response makes them useful for monitoring intravenous iron therapy.
3. Ferritin and transferrin are acute phase proteins, so their concentrations are altered in sepsis and cannot be used to accurately diagnose iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia in sepsis patients. Hemoglobin concentration is a late marker of response and can be affected by factors other than iron replenishment, like blood loss from frequent lab draws.
4. Reticulocyte subpopulations are categorized by their fluorescence ratios, which correspond to RNA content and reticulocyte maturity. More immature reticulocytes like high fluorescence ratio reticulocytes (HFR) reflect greater bone marrow production. Monitoring shifts in these subpopulations can reflect changes in erythropoietic activity in response to iron therapy.

Thus, reliability-based design approaches have been introduced into deterministic designs of timber structures. Bui et al. investigated the effect of vibration frequencies randomness for engineered wood products by adopting Monte Carlo Simulation. A probabilistic glulam model was proposed by Kandler and Füssl considering random stiffness for each lamination case.

[Context] In addition to diffusive heat flow, superfluids support the thermal transport via a hydrodynamic process. two-fluid counterflow where relative motion of the superfluid and normal component results in heat flow. This effect is well-established in studies of superfluid He, but results on superfluid He are limited. In steady-state thermal counterflow through a channel, the temperature gradient generates a fountain pressure, such that the difference in chemical potential between the two ends of the channel is zero. The superfluid component (driven by gradients in chemical potential) flows at constant velocity toward the hot end. The fountain pressure forces the normal (entropy carrying) component in the opposite direction, with volume flow rate determined by viscous transport in the channel. If the normal component is not viscously clamped, this hydrodynamic thermal transport dominates and the thermal conductivity increases sharply as Tc is traversed from the normal state.
[Question] What are the two mechanisms for thermal transport in superfluids?

1. In steady-state thermal counterflow through a channel, the temperature gradient generates a fountain pressure. This makes the chemical potential difference between the two ends of the channel zero.

[Context] The natural environment of Poland is characterized by a different degree of pollution depending on the region. Due to the different degrees of anthropogenic pressure (urbanization and share of industry) and natural conditions, individual regions are exposed to environmental pollution at different levels. It is worth emphasizing that the level of heavy metals is usually monitored selectively in agricultural areas, and even less often in agricultural and forest areas where the species in question most often lives. therefore, it is necessary to control their occurrence. For this purpose, a number of methods are used, among which one of the most popular is bioindication. Due to the ability of certain pollutants, such as HM, to accumulate in the tissues of living organisms, it is possible to conduct a non-invasive examination by using the feathers of birds living in a given area. Therefore, the study aims to assess the possibility of using pheasant feathers (Phasianus colchicus) as a bioindicator in screening tests of environmental contamination, and thus to determine the concentrations of heavy metals (lead—Pb, arsenic—As, cadmium—Cd, chromium—Cr, nickel—Ni, and zinc—Zn) in the analyzed tissue of animals living in areas with different levels of anthropopressure and industrialization.
[Question] Why is it important to monitor the level of heavy metals in Poland?

[Context] Cathodoluminescence measurements have been used extensively to investigate the boron concentration in CVD grown diamond. From the CL results presented here for B-DNDs it is found that the ratio of free excitons (FE)/ to bound excitons (BE) (5.27 and 5.21 eV respectively) is about 1 in most sampled locations. Taking the methodology used for CVD diamond then implies an average boron concentration of 1–2 × 10 cm to be present in the B-DNDs measured here. Although this reasoning was developed for macroscopic CVD grown boron diamond, the fact that the B-DNDs here are agglomerated in clusters of hundreds of nm to a few microns will likely allow the existence of free excitonic features, regardless of the small size of individual DNDs. The result is temperature dependent, and the spectra were obtained at approximately 95 K. It is important to note that edge emission (free excitons) are expected from (100) growth segments, but not in (111), where impurities like boron and nitrogen are more likely to exist. CL measurements performed here contained contributions from many clusters of B-DNDs given that the electron beam has a diameter of around 200 nm, making the simultaneous observation of emissions from different growth sectors likely. The photoluminescence (PL) feature with the peak at 469 may be explained by the existence of N4 nitrogen centres, which are composed of four substitutional nitrogen atoms surrounding a vacancy. According to Collins, there is no evidence that this form of nitrogen impurity behaves as a donor in diamond. The 522 nm peak is assigned to the first order (Raman) peak in PL. In lightly boron doped diamond, the first-order Raman peak is usually accompanied by an N-V centre luminescence peak at 636 nm. The suppression of this 636 nm peak in the PL spectrum, has previously been attributed to an increase of boron in the diamond lattice, potentially saturating vacancies in N-V centres. The 575 nm N-V centre peak is also missing from the B-DND PL spectra recorded here, offering further evidence for the presence of substitutional boron.
[Question] Why can free excitonic features exist in the B-DNDs despite their small individual sizes?
Choices:
1. The B-DNDs are agglomerated in clusters of hundreds of nm to a few microns in size. This allows the existence of free excitonic features, even though the individual DNDs are very small.
2. The methodology used previously for CVD grown macroscopic boron diamond was applied. This methodology implies an average boron concentration of 1–2 × 10^17 cm^-3 based on a FE/BE ratio of ~1.

1. Empirical ASM-mass wasting relationships are needed to distinguish mass-wasting perturbations due to extreme events from expected background rates based on ASM strength. This would improve our ability to account for extreme events in mass-wasting forecasts and susceptibility models.
2. It is challenging to quantify the relative impacts of different mass-wasting drivers in the Himalayas because most studies focus on the impacts of individual drivers only. There is a lack of research quantifying the relative contributions of the different drivers.
3. The Gorkha earthquake caused elevated rates of new monsoon-triggered mass-wasting in the 2015 monsoon season, likely due to earthquake preconditioning effects. However, without empirical ASM-mass wasting relationships, it is hard to quantify if post-earthquake mass-wasting was above expected levels based on ASM strength alone.
4. While relationships between precipitation intensity and short-term suspended fluvial sediment flux are well described, an empirical relationship between ASM strength and ASM-triggered mass-wasting in central-eastern Nepal remains elusive.

[Context] Historically, housekeeping genes, such as actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), have been used extensively as the internal references for RT-qPCR analysis without empirical validations. Under specific experimental conditions, however, their expression may vary substantially. Consequently, there is a growing awareness to select suitable reference genes prior RT-qPCR analysis. This is especially true for non-model organisms, which are currently lagging behind well characterized model organisms in terms of genomic resources and empirically tested reference genes. As a result, researchers have started to embrace the MIQE guidelines and adopted the concept of using multiple rather than a single normalizers. In addition, both systematic and customized studies are encouraged for each organism to identify suitable reference genes.
[Question] What two approaches are encouraged to identify suitable reference genes?
Choices:
1. It is important to select suitable reference genes prior to RT-qPCR analysis because under specific experimental conditions, traditional housekeeping genes may have variable expression. Using unsuitable reference genes can lead to inaccurate normalization and quantification of gene expression.
2. Two approaches encouraged are: 1) Systematic studies to identify reference genes suitable for the specific organism. 2) Customized studies tailored to the experimental conditions being studied. Both kinds of studies help empirically validate reference genes for each organism and experiment.
3. Non-model organisms currently lack extensive genomic resources and empirically tested reference genes compared to well-characterized model organisms. Therefore, researchers studying non-model organisms need to be especially diligent in selecting and validating appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR experiments.

[Question] Why are maintenance-free, long-lasting power sources important for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) used in structural health monitoring?
Choices:
1. PEHs have several advantages over existing power sources that have limited lifetime and require constant replacement. Specifically, PEHs can provide small and sustainable power sources with potentially unlimited lifetime. This makes them well-suited for applications that require long-term, maintenance-free operation.
2. PEHs could be used to power wireless sensors for real-time structural health monitoring of bridges, aircraft, and power plants. The sustainable power from PEHs would allow these wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to operate continuously without battery replacement. This helps prevent catastrophic failure of critical infrastructures.
3. PEHs convert ambient vibration energy into electricity. This provides a renewable power source that can operate indefinitely, as long as ambient vibrations are present. For applications like wireless structural monitoring sensors, the vibrations from the environment (e.g. from passing traffic on a bridge) can be harvested by PEHs to provide sustainable power over long periods, eliminating the need for battery replacement.
4. For WSNs used to monitor bridges, aircraft, and power plants, it is essential to have small power sources that can operate for long periods without maintenance or battery replacement. This ensures continuous, uninterrupted monitoring to detect damage or unsafe conditions that could lead to catastrophic failures. Since replacing batteries in remote sensors on bridges or aircraft would be difficult and costly, the long lifetime of PEHs makes them a suitable power solution.

[Context] A primary differentiator is whether CASP methods are template-based or template-free. Template-based models assign scores to a pre-defined set of reaction templates—generalized reaction rules—which can be applied to the input target molecule to produce precursors. When templates are algorithmically extracted, each reaction suggested by a template-based model can be linked to precedent examples to be interpreted and reviewed by a chemist. Examples of template-based synthetic organic tools include ASKCOS, which uses a set of templates automatically extracted from Reaxys, and Synthia, which uses expert-curated templates. analogous data-driven and expert bioretrosynthetic tools include Retropath, which uses templates extracted from metabolic pathway databases and RetroBioCat, which focuses on industrially-relevant biocatalytic reactions. Template-free models instead learn to generate reactant molecules from an input product molecule end-to-end. The lack of pre-defined reaction rules theoretically allows template-free models to predict novel reactions, but complicates the task of linking predictions to existing reaction data. Examples of this approach include IBM’s RXN and BioNavi-NP, both of which employ sequence-to-sequence Transformer models to generate precursor SMILES strings directly from product SMILES strings.

[Context] In this work, we achieve thermally enhanced CNT adhesives for high-temperature applications by rationally designing vertically aligned double-walled CNT (VA-DWNT) strands with bundled top nodes induced by plasma treatment. In contrast to our expectations, we find that the adhesion strength of our CNT dry adhesives on rough surfaces (for example, commercially-available copper foils, vide infra) increased with increasing temperature by over six-fold up to 143 N cm at high temperatures (for example, 1,000 °C), one of the highest values reported. This unusual adhesion behaviour can be rationalized by a ‘nano-interlocking’ adhesion mechanism, in which the plasma-induced CNT top nodes can easily penetrate into cavities of a naturally or temperature-induced rough surface, followed by temperature-induced deformation of the flexible double-walled CNT segments along the surface profile to form nano-interlocks (vide infra). The screw-like nano-interlocking interaction distinguishes the CNT dry adhesive reported in this study from other conventional adhesives, including conventional CNT dry adhesives and polymeric dry adhesives. Our CNT dry adhesives sustain many temperature transition cycles over a wide operational temperature range from −196 to 1,000 °C with a high thermal stability and a temperature-enhanced adhesion strength up to 143 N cm (one of the highest adhesion strengths among all known pure CNT dry adhesives).

[Context] A prerequisite to unravel the role of an endogenous timing system in synchronising daily and seasonal behavioural patterns and physiological functions is the characterisation of the clock machinery itself. Endogenous clocks are based on overlapping molecular feedback loops that generate a self-sustained molecular oscillation of about 24 hours continuously synchronized by environmental signals. Despite the overall conservation of the molecular clock’s main components in animals (clock, cycle/bmal, period, and cryptochrome), their functions and interactions have been modelled during taxa evolution giving rise to different clock’s molecular architectures.

Among Crustacea, the Atlantic horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus., the copepods Calanus finmarchicus. and Tigriopus californicus. possess putative orthologues of core and accessory clock genes.

[Context] To control the dynamics of the residual electrons and hence, the plasma channel structure and the plasma bullet propagation, we customized the DC voltage to merely vary it over the timescales comparable with the expected lifetime of the residual electrons. In this way, by retaining the residual electrons long enough to affect the breakdown dynamics, here we report on the two exotic bullet-prone plume structures both featuring an uncommon large bright still area in addition to the common dim propagating bullet area.

This deterministic approach offers a simple and versatile control of the jet channel structure and conductivity as well as the plasma bullet propagation vitally needed for next-generation applications.
[Question] Why is the ability to control the plasma channel structure and plasma bullet propagation important?
Choices:
1. Using short interruptions of a continuous high-voltage DC supply, two exotic bullet-prone plume structures were generated - one featuring a large bright still area in addition to the common dim propagating bullet area, and another containing a highly-conducting dark channel behind the bright area.
2. The common technique is applying short pulses of DC voltage. Interrupting a continuous DC supply is a simpler and more energy-efficient alternative to short pulsed DC.

[Context] Recently we have demonstrated the atomic cladding waveguide (ACWG), consisting of a silicon-nitride (SiN) core surrounded by a cladding of Rb vapour, which is introduced by integrating an atomic vapour cell above the optical chip. In this demonstration, the ACWG had an interaction length of 1.5 mm and a mode area of 0.3λ. With this configuration we demonstrated basic spectroscopy, extremely low saturation power and two-photon transitions. Subsequently, the integration of ACWG based micro-ring resonators has been demonstrated to achieve efficient all-optical modulation. Even more recently, Ritter et al. have implemented such ACWGs in a Mach Zhender interferometer configuration. Such a platform offers several prominent advantages. dimension-wise, an ACWG, has a mode area that is about two orders of magnitude smaller than previously demonstrated on-chip approaches, making it a fine candidate for efficient nonlinear light–vapour interactions. In addition, due to the ability to integrate large variety of existing photonic circuits with the ACWG, this approach can further enhance both linear and nonlinear light–matter interaction via the use of resonators such as micro-ring resonators and photonic crystal resonators, and structures such as slot waveguides. The ACWG SiN platform further enables to couple broadband optical signals, making it applicable (simultaneously) to various alkali vapours such as Cs and Rb and various optical transitions whether the D1 and D2 lines, or higher excited Rydberg states.

[Context] Heat shock and to a lesser extent cold shock experiments have been able to provide better understanding of coral physiology, showing that elevated, but also depressed temperatures, can cause breakdown of the symbiosis especially when combined with high irradiance. These conditions induce severe damage to the photosynthetic apparatus, specifically, the reaction center of photosystem II (PSII), the Calvin cycle, and/or the thylakoid membranes and can result in high levels of reactive oxygen species. The ensuing oxidative stress can lead to cell apoptosis or exocytosis of the coral host. As for the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, changes in temperature elicit a number of responses including changes in population density, photosynthetic pigment concentration, photosynthetic efficiency, photosynthetic capacity, D1 reaction center protein concentration and xanthophyll cycling. Furthermore, PSII repair processes are also inhibited by elevated temperatures under high light intensities. Thus host functions, such as coral calcification, growth and reproduction, can be greatly reduced by small changes in temperature. To address the regulation and extent of these processes, we studied the effects of simultaneous cold and heat stress on physiological processes in reef-building corals. Exposures to elevated and depressed temperature were conducted in parallel in order to provide a consistent framework for the comparison of the effects of temperature on the physiological state of the coral holobiont.

Unlike electrons, which have a well-defined spin, light is a massless particle that does not have an intrinsic spin.

In this press-fit situation, the implant is situated in intimate contact with the bone walls, hence it is more suitable for placement in Type 4 porous bone. However, the undersized technique induces high pressure on the bone walls, mainly on high density bones, which may result in plastic deformation and microcracks.
[Question] Why does undersized drilling induce high pressure on the bone walls?

This energy range is particularly interesting as various solid state lasing sources like the historic Ruby laser and AlGaAs semiconductor laser exhibit strong emissions close to this band. In this work, we have narrowed down our study on LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, as these two materials have an extremely sharp PL with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of as low as 1 nm. In the case of Ruby, which is essentially Cr doped in Al2O3, presence of strong and sharp PL lines (tunable with temperature and pressure) has been exploited as temperature and pressure sensors.

[Context] The absorbtion of energy by the medium associated with dose results in ionisation and excitation of molecules of this medium. These events happen within 10 s after an ion's passage. The next stage of local energy relaxation happens after 10 to 10 s when locally produced secondary electrons interact with the medium (effects similar to electron-phonon coupling take place) and the energy becomes distributed between the vibrational and translational degrees of freedom of the molecules. This, according to the predictions of Refs., for carbon ions, happens within a cylinder of about one nm radius, which is so small that the temperature within this cylinder increases by over 1000 K by 10 s (we will refer to it as the “hot cylinder”). This increase of temperature brings about a rapid increase of pressure (up to 1 GPa) compared to the atmospheric pressure outside the cylinder. Such circumstances cause the onset of a cylindrical shock wave described by the strong explosion scenario. The pressure rapidly increases on the wave front and then decreases in the wake. The shock wave propagates for about 10 ps, loses energy and decays. The intriguing questions that were raised in Refs., are what such a shock wave can do with biomolecules such as DNA located in the region of its propagation through the medium and what other effects can be explained by the transport related to the shock wave. The forces acting on DNA segments were predicted to be as large as 2 nN, which is more than enough to break a covalent bond, causing a strand break. however, these forces are only acting for a short time and it remained unclear whether this is sufficient to cause severe damage to DNA molecules.

Probably as a result, its absence causes asplenia without detectable abnormalities in other organs. In order to better understand the function/cell fate of Tlx1 expressing cells, we have previously generated a mouse strain harboring a mutant Tlx1 gene allele in which CreER and Venus genes are knocked into the first exon of the Tlx1 gene (Tlx1). We demonstrated that Tlx1 is required for cell fate determination of mesenchymal cells of the spleen primordium, as Tlx1-deficient progeny in the embryonic spleen primordium became dorsal pancreatic mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, Tlx1 expression was found to persist in a specific subpopulation of mesenchymal cells in the perifollicular area of the postnatal spleen. Also, Tlx1 cells, because they have the highest expression of CXCL12 among the splenic stromal cells, serve as an extramedullary hematopoietic stem cell niche for emergency hematopoiesis. Mesenchymal progenitor cells are the major constituent of the hematopoietic niche in the bone marrow. However, it remains unclear whether such mesenchymal progenitors with tri-lineage (adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic) differentiation potential as well as hematopoietic niche activity exist in the neonatal spleen and, if so, whether these cells also function as LTo cells to differentiate into functionally mature stromal cells that support structural integrity of the developing spleen.
[Question] Do tri-lineage mesenchymal progenitor cells exist in the neonatal spleen?
Choices:
1. A mouse strain was generated with a mutant Tlx1 allele where CreER and Venus genes were knocked into the first exon of the Tlx1 gene. This allowed tracking of Tlx1 expressing cells and conditionally knocking out Tlx1.
2. Tlx1 expression was found to persist in a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells in the postnatal spleen perifollicular area. These Tlx1 cells serve as an extramedullary hematopoietic stem cell niche due to high CXCL12 expression.
3. Tlx1, also known as Hox11, is a transcription factor expressed in the E10.5 dorsal splenopancreatic mesenchyme in a relatively restricted manner.

[Context] Meanwhile, the effect of the spin-coating time on the OFET performance has not been studied extensively. In a majority of articles reporting investigations on solution-processed OFETs, the spinning time was varied from 3 to 120 s, depending on the volatility of the solvent used. Field-effect mobilities of semi-crystalline polymer semiconductors could be improved by controlling the spin-casting time because the molecular orientation and π-π stacking interaction of the conjugated molecules could be enhanced by controlling the crystallization speed resulting from the residual solvent after spin-coating. For example, Na et al. examined the effects of residual solvent in spin-cast polythiophene film on the electrical properties of OFETs. They discovered that an optimum amount of residual solvent after spin-coating for a few seconds enhances the molecular order of the polythiophene film, resulting in high field-effect mobility. In small-molecule semiconductor/insulating polymer blends, controlling the residual solvent in spin-cast blend films is also important for inducing vertical phase-separation, while achieving control over the crystallization of small molecule semiconductor for high-performance OFETs.

[Context] Regional homogeneity (ReHo) is another newly developed method to evaluate the similarity or consistency of spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations within a region in the whole brain voxel analysis. The ReHo of BOLD activity is now thought to account for differences in neurovascular coupling and task activation. The ReHo method has also been successfully used to study the functional regulation of patients in the resting state, reflecting the changes in temporal neuronal activity in specific regions. If ReHo increases, the local connections of neurons in local brain regions are enhanced. However, the reduced ReHo indicates weakened local connections of local neurons. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a significant correlation between abnormal ReHo and changes in neuronal activity in local brain functional regions. In other words, when the ReHo is abnormal, the synchronous activity of local neurons changes. Only one study has reported significant changes in ReHo in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and left superior frontal gyrus after one month of CPAP treatment in OSA. In our previous study, we reported that amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) changes after a single night of CPAP treatment in severe OSA patients. The fALFF is a different evaluation method from ALFF, which has a better inhibitory effect on non-specific signals in resting state fMRI. However, there have been no studies of fALFF in patients with OSA before and after CPAP treatment.
[Question] What is the difference between ReHo and ALFF?
Choices:
1. fALFF filters out nonspecific signal components and isolates only low frequency fluctuations in the BOLD signal. It has better specificity than standard ALFF. No studies have examined fALFF changes after CPAP treatment in OSA patients.
2. One study found significant ReHo changes in the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, supplementary motor area, and left superior frontal gyrus after one month of CPAP treatment in OSA patients.
3. ReHo evaluates synchronization of local BOLD signal fluctuations within a region. ALFF measures the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations of the BOLD signal in a region. They provide complementary information about regional brain activity.
4. ReHo evaluates the similarity or consistency of spontaneous low-frequency blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations within a region in whole brain voxel analysis. ReHo reflects synchronization of local neuronal activity. Increased ReHo indicates enhanced local connections and reduced ReHo indicates weakened local connections of neurons in a region.

Recently, a highly effective small molecule inhibitor of VEEV was developed with the assistance of a high throughput, cell-based screen. Referred to as ML336, this molecule was found to have a EC90 of 170 nM against a VEEV vaccine strain (TC-83) and reduce viral titer by 630,000-fold at nanomolar concentrations. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of ML336 to mice infected with TC-83 resulted in a 71% survival rate as compared to the 14% survival rate observed in untreated mice. While the potency of this drug at nanomolar concentrations and in vivo study results are encouraging, ML336 has limited solubility (0.04 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4) and limited stability (reduction of 17% and 35% of drug in PBS and mouse plasma, respectively, after 3 hours) in aqueous solutions, potentially reducing its efficacy.

[Context] Revived from near pseudoscience status during the “AI winter”, deep neural networks, which feature large model capacities and generalities, have stimulated a plethora of applications across different disciplines (including materials science) in recent years. Existing deep learning-based approaches in materials science fall into two categories. material-system-dependent or -independent. Material-system-dependent approaches train deep learning models based on collected materials data, with their subsequent applications are often limited to the material system used for training. For instance, Cang et al. extracted microstructure representations for alloy systems using convolutional deep belief networks. Their model was trained with 100 images of size 200 × 200 pixels. While their model generated satisfactory reconstruction results for the chosen alloy material, their model was highly constrained to the type of alloy system used for the training set. Li et al. developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to learn the latent variables of a given set of synthetic microstructures, but their model needs to be retrained for application to a set of microstructures with significantly different dispersion. In contrast to these material-system-dependent approaches, transfer learning provides an alternative to capture microstructure characteristics without the need for training with a set of materials data (i. e., it is material-system-independent). Transfer learning refers to the strategy of migrating knowledge for a new task from a related task that has already been learned. In the context of microstructure analysis, deep-learning models trained for benchmark tasks using computer vision are fully or partially adopted to quantify microstructures or to address other complex challenges.

Choices:

[Context] Most dielectric materials (e. g. TiO2 and ZnO) are form shells and show high chemical stability due to their matched lattice and surface free energy. Next, the high dielectric loss shell can make up a slight decrease in the magnetic loss. Among these absorbers, Fe3O4-based core-structures have been widely studied including Fe3O4@ZrO2, Fe3O4@TiO2, Fe3O4@SnO2 and Fe3O4@CuSiO3. Of course, other magnetic/dielectric structures have also been reported including Fe@SnO2 and Co@ZnO. In fact, these pristine magnetic cores did not show the interesting complex permeability value due to their smaller Ms. After introducing the non-magnetic material, the integral magnetic loss ability will further decrease. Therefore, a high Ms magnetic core is needed. Of the magnetic materials, FeCo shows a higher Ms than most magnetic materials. In our previous work, we successfully synthesized the hexagonal cone-like Fe50Co50 with a high Ms value of 225 emu/g—higher than the theoretical value of 218 emu/g. Surprisingly, the corresponding μ′ of Fe50Co50 is more than 2 at the early frequency region, which is larger than most of magnetic materials (usually at 1.5). Furthermore, the Fe50Co50 displays better air-stability at room temperature than Fe or Co single state.
[Question] What are some properties of FeCo alloys that make them a good choice for microwave absorber cores?
Choices:
1. The text states that FeCo alloys can have higher saturation magnetization (Ms) than other magnetic materials. Specifically, it mentions synthesizing Fe50Co50 with a high Ms value of 225 emu/g, higher than the theoretical limit of 218 emu/g for FeCo. The text also states that Fe50Co50 has a permeability (μ') greater than 2 in the early frequency region, which is higher than most magnetic materials. Additionally, FeCo displays better air stability at room temperature than Fe or Co alone.
2. The text explains that ""these pristine magnetic cores did not show the interesting complex permeability value due to their smaller Ms."" Ms refers to saturation magnetization. The text states that after introducing the non-magnetic dielectric material shell, the overall magnetic loss ability of the core-shell particle will decrease. Therefore, magnetic cores with high Ms values are needed.
3. According to the text, some common dielectric materials used in core-shell microwave absorbers are TiO2, ZnO, and CuSiO3. The text states that ""Most dielectric materials (e. g. TiO2 and ZnO) are form shells and show high chemical stability due to their matched lattice and surface free energy."" It also mentions core-shell structures like ""Fe3O4@TiO2, Fe3O4@ZnO, and Fe3O4@CuSiO3.""
4. While not directly stated in the text, high permeability is known to be an important factor in increasing the magnetic loss properties of microwave absorbing materials. Permeability determines how easily the material can be magnetized. High permeability materials can dissipate more electromagnetic wave energy through magnetic losses.

[Context] OPVs photogeneration dynamics initial stages are nowadays so optimised that both photon absorption and exciton dissociation take place in the femtosecond time-scale (≈100), and with high quantum efficiency. it is thus in the subsequent evolution where efforts have to focus. Importantly, notice that exciton dissociation happens with the hole remaining spatially fixed in the donor. The process then has to be understood as the excited electron travelling to the polymer-fullerene interface, where long-range delocalisation of the electron wave function in eigenstates of the fullerene acceptor allows to avoid rapid recombination and enables ultrafast charge separation. Since recently, free charge (FC) state formation –i. e. complete electron-hole dissociation– is thought to happen in small steps or “jumps” via intermediate charge transfer (CT) states coupled with strong environment vibrational modes. Charge transfer states, also known as polaron pairs, are weakly bound intermolecular e-h pairs whose role is to mediate charge generation in organic photovoltaic devices. Lying at the D-A interface, CT properties such as delocalisation (size) much depend on its optical characteristics as well as on their mutual coupling. They in turn determine the maximum voltage attainable at the OPV, thus becoming critical if the aim is to improve the performance. However, due mainly to their experimental inaccessibility (they are mostly dark states, with very low dipole strength), and the wide diversity of structures and materials a general model is lacking, making the comprehension and manipulation of these states both difficult and compelling. It is therefore in the charge transfer stage of photocurrent generation where the challenge and opportunities to improve the efficiency of OPVs abide.
[Question] How does the excited electron move during exciton dissociation?
Choices:
1. The charge transfer stage of photocurrent generation represents the main opportunity to improve OPV efficiency, as this is where the challenges and opportunities reside.
2. The excited electron travels to the polymer-fullerene interface during exciton dissociation in an OPV device.
3. The fullerene acceptor enables ultrafast charge separation due to the long-range delocalization of the electron wave function in eigenstates of the fullerene. This avoids rapid recombination.

[Context] As a part of the commensal microbiota, C. albicans colonizes multiple mucosal sites, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GlcNAc has been implicated in commensal growth of C. albicans in the GI tract, where glucose is often limited and GlcNAc can be released from bacteria. C. albicans can also scavenge GlcNAc from glycosaminoglycan of the host cell extracellular matrix by secreting a GlcNAc-inducible β-hexosaminidase. The ability to use environmental GlcNAc is important for the existence of C. albicans in its host niches, as GlcNAc catabolic pathway mutants have significantly reduced virulence. Not only can GlcNAc induce genes for GlcNAc catabolism, it can also promote C. albicans cells to undergo hyphal development and phenotypic switching between two heritable cell states. These morphogenesis programs of C. albicans are linked to its virulence, infection of distinct host niches and immune evasion. In addition to C. albicans, GlcNAc also triggers a rapid morphogenetic programme in two thermally dimorphic fungal pathogens, Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis. Uncovering the mechanism for GlcNAc signalling is important for understanding fungal pathogenesis.

[Context] The ability to accurately model shallow dopants has taken on particular relevance in the context of quantum information science, as exemplified by the recent experiments of Pla et al. They used electron spin resonance (ESR) to measure transitions between total-spin states of the coupled electron-nucleus spin degree of freedom of shallow bismuth donors in silicon, a system with applications in atomic clock transitions for silicon-based spin qubits. They observed a split Hahn echo peak corresponding to the \(\left|4,-4\right\rangle \leftrightarrow \left|5,-5\right\rangle\) transition. Orientation-dependent measurements suggest that this results from strain caused by the thermal contraction of an aluminum resonator patterned on the surface of the sample. This result raises the question. how does strain cause such a dramatic splitting in the ESR line. Traditional approaches, such as the “valley repopulation model”, fail to provide an explanation. Another model invokes the coupling of the quadrupole moment of the donor nucleus with the electric field gradient (EFG) induced by the electron wavefunction, but accurate information about the strength of this interaction is lacking. Ab initio calculations have already been shown to successfully determine EFGs at nuclei. An accurate calculation of the donor wavefunction will thus allow the determination of the EFG at the nucleus and the strength of the quadrupole coupling. Additional motivation was provided by subsequent experiments that identified an unexpectedly large dependency of the isotropic hyperfine parameter A on the hydrostatic component of strain. We will therefore also explicitly explore the strain dependence of A.

Indeed, the lifetime of managed blue PHOLEDs is at least 30 times longer than previously reported blue PHOLEDs with similar colour coordinates.

[Context] Recently, the emerging development of single-molecule techniques enables the observation and characterization of individual molecules for exquisite qualitative and quantitative analysis, avoiding ensemble error. Single-molecule techniques are well suited for characterizing multiple PTMs dispersed along the entire protein sequence but no feasible method exists. One promising approach is single-molecule imaging combined with immunofluorescence labeling, which may yield quantitative measurement of PTM status at the single-molecule level. Methods based on super-resolution imaging in intact cells cannot control the intrinsic density of interesting protein, preventing the discrimination of individual modified proteins by high molecular density on the PM. Methods based on single-molecule isolation can properly control the density of the protein immobilized on the single-molecule surface. However, this seemingly straightforward strategy comes with several practical impediments. First, antibody host species, especially immobilization antibody species, is cumbersome on the selection of antibody sets for multiple immunolabeling. Second, interacting proteins may mask the PTM sites, serving as docking sites for diverse signaling proteins. Third, multiple immunofluorescence labeling on a single polypeptide chain can be prevented by steric hindrance, also known as epitope occlusion. These limitations have hampered the application of single-molecule isolation techniques to the study of combinatorial PTMs.
[Question] How can methods based on single-molecule isolation help overcome the challenges of super-resolution imaging?
Choices:
1. Methods based on single-molecule isolation allow for proper control over the density of the protein immobilized on the single-molecule surface. This helps enable the discrimination of individual modified protein molecules.
2. Challenges include difficulties selecting compatible antibody species, masking of PTM sites by interacting proteins, and epitope occlusion due to steric hindrance of multiple antibodies binding in close proximity on a single protein chain.
3. Single-molecule techniques allow for the observation and characterization of individual protein molecules, avoiding ensemble errors that can occur when studying populations of molecules. Single-molecule techniques are also well suited for characterizing multiple post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are dispersed along the entire protein sequence.

However, the Xpert G4 assay’s sensitivity for TB detection is inadequate when few bacilli are present in the specimens, particularly in vulnerable groups such as HIV-infected patients, children and in extra-pulmonary TB samples. Moreover, in terms of RIF resistance detection, the Xpert MTB/RIF G4 cartridge assay gives false-positive results for strains that carry phenotypically silent mutations (synonymous mutations), or for paucibacillary specimens.

[Context] From a chemist’s perspective, these electronic properties are rooted in the \(\pi\)-conjugation, which is also associated with thermal and chemical stability. This concept is one of the most-frequently cited ones in 2D COF research. For semiconducting 2D COFs, \(\pi\)-conjugation is frequently connected with improved electronic properties, delocalization of states and good charge-carrier transport, but this connection is usually not supported or quantified and hence remains elusive. While for single molecules a number of different measures for \(\pi\)-conjugation or aromaticity, that quantify the entire \(\pi\)-electron system, have been suggested, e. g. resonance energy, aromatic stabilization energy, multicenter bond index, Bird index, Fluctuation index, Shannon aromaticity or nucleus independent chemical shift (NICS), and are routinely simulated for monomers, this has not been done for 2D COFs. Notwithstanding, it is expected that also for 2D COFs, \(\pi\)-conjugation is an important prerequisite for dispersive electronic bands, low band gaps, low effective masses and that it affects optical properties or allows for high carrier mobilities. In this sense, the route towards better \(\pi\)-conjugated systems is believed to be an important design principle provoking claims of “high \(\pi\)-conjugation” or “full \(\pi\)-conjugation” in recent literature. However, only scant attention has been paid to investigate these measures for 2D COFs and assess their suitability in rationalizing the global electronic structure or to understand delocalization of electrons in these materials, which is necessary for engineering their properties by synthetic approaches.

This motif was also visualized by AFM in chiral PPAs possessing a screw sense excess. Curiously, although the existence of helix reversals was evidenced in the solid state through high-resolution AFM images, the study of this structural motif is solution has not yet been addressed. This fact is due to the complexity of the polymers and the absence of robust structural tools that allows determining the secondary structure of polymers in solution.
[Question] How else was the existence of helix reversals evidenced in PPAs besides the AFM studies by Prof. Yashima?
Choices:
1. Prof. Yashima found that PPAs exhibit helix reversals, which are structural motifs that induce helical inversions along the polymer chain. This was shown through high-resolution AFM images of a PPA bearing α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) n-decyl esters as an achiral pendant group.
2. The AFM studies by Prof. Yashima allowed for modeling an approximate secondary structure of the PPAs, and enabled direct visualization of the presence of helix reversals within the helical PPA scaffold. However, no precise information could be extracted about the specific locations or frequency of the reversals present within the helices. Only the existence of reversals was evidenced.
3. The existence of helix reversals in PPAs was also evidenced by AFM studies of chiral PPAs possessing a screw sense excess. The helix reversals could be directly visualized in the solid state PPAs through the high-resolution AFM imaging.
4. The study of helix reversals in solution has not been well addressed due to the complexity of the PPA polymers and the lack of robust structural tools that allow determination of polymer secondary structure in solution. There are difficulties studying this structural motif in solution as opposed to the solid state.

[Context] As the CAVA device is an entirely novel device for long-term, ambulatory monitoring, there is little previous literature with which comparisons can be made. However, a portable recorder for examining nystagmus in non-clinical settings was described several decades ago. The prototype described could record two-channels of eye movement for a period of ten minutes, although this was intended to be increased to eighty-minutes in the following version. Owing to the limited data storage, the device was intended to be worn and activated by a subject at the onset of an episode of dizziness. Therefore, the device relied on the wearer to correctly identify the onset of an attack, and on them being capable of applying the device whilst experiencing symptoms of dizziness. The CAVA device represents a significant improvement on that device in terms of the duration of data capture and portability. If the CAVA system can detect nystagmus from its ambulatory data, this could pave the way to overcome many of the shortfalls of existing approaches to vestibular assessment, potentially reducing the number of hospital visits and unnecessary tests, and providing faster diagnoses and access to treatment.

[Context] One of the simplest electronic elements that can perform a useful logic function is a voltage inverter operating as NOT logic gate. All-inkjet printed logic gates can be produced in two configurations. in circuits with a complementary pair of p-type and n-type transistors operating simultaneously, or in a unipolar configuration where one transistor and one resistor work in a single voltage inverter. A transistor with a shorted gate and source electrodes is often used as a resistor. In most previous research on printed logic gates, printing has been used to apply only one layer or some of the layers—e. g. electrodes and semiconductors. Other layers, such as a dielectric, have been deposited by other methods. The semiconducting layer is generally printed with commercially available inks based on organic semiconductors or carbon nanotubes. All-inkjet printed devices are still rare, and one of the key reason is that inkjet printing technology is still insufficiently mastered. There are relatively few reports in the literature of NOT gates in which all the components, such as electrodes, current-conducting paths, and dielectric and semiconductor layers, were fabricated entirely using the inkjet printing technique. Fully printed logic gates with layers of semiconductors applied to a substrate by inkjet printing with a TIPS-pentacene solution are described in Refs. The resistors in the logic gates were obtained by connecting the gate and the source electrodes of the transistors. For such logic gates to function properly, their resistance should be much higher than the channel resistance in the on-state and much lower than the resistance of the transistor in the off-state. Some reports show that printing resistors with high resistance is difficult. Jung et al. described the properties of resistors fabricated by inkjet printing using a mixture of poly (3,4-ethylene-1,4-dioxythiophene) and sulfonated polystyrene called PEDOT. PSS.

[Context] Conventional air-conditioning systems dehumidify air by cooling it below the dew point temperature to remove moisture via condensation, and then reheating it to the required temperature, which requires high energy consumption. Various novel ideas for energy-saving technologies in buildings have recently emerged. Therefore, independent humidity control systems need to be developed to achieve the desired balance between energy consumption and indoor comfort. As we all know, moisture can be autonomously transported from high-humidity to low-humidity environments through membranes. According to the thermo-osmosis theory, moisture can also be transported from a low-humidity to a high-humidity environment under the driving force of thermal gradients in a membrane. This pathway or mode of moisture transport is referred to a moisture pump and is analogous to a heat pump. Extensive studies have recently been performed regarding the high-efficiency use of solar energy for surface-localized heating and steam generation. Therefore, solar-driven moisture pump dehumidification technology is particularly attractive because of the abundance of solar energy, which results in significant energy-saving potential and ecological and economic benefits.

[Context] Until recently, hydroxyurea (HU), which induces fetal Hb (HbF) production had been, for over two decades, the only U. S.-approved drug for the treatment of SCD. The expressed high O2-affinity HbF modulates clinical severity by reducing the concentration of HbS to inhibit polymerization, serving as a model for antisickling therapies. A second mechanism of action involves direct destabilization effect of the Hb polymer, as the homo-tetramers of HbF (α2γ2) and hybrid HbFS tetramers (α2γβ) cannot be incorporated into fibers because of disruptive effects on the intermolecular contacts of normal HbS. Three new drugs for SCD were approved in the last three years by the FDA. The first is L-glutamine (Endari), which was approved in 2017. l-glutamine works by increasing the amount of reduced form nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in erythrocytes, which is expected to reduce oxidative stress, and potentially result in fewer painful crises and adverse events. In 2019, crizanlizumab (AKA Adakveo) and Voxelotor (AKA GBT-440 or Oxbryta) were approved. Crizanlizumab, a monoclonal antibody, reduces the frequency of painful VOCs by targeting P-selectin, which is implicated in the pathologic endothelial adhesion of sickle erythrocytes and leukocytes. Voxelotor is the first aromatic aldehyde-containing antisickling compound approved for SCD that targets HbS polymerization by increasing Hb O2-affinity. The groundwork for this therapeutic approach began in the 1970s, and was furthered by our group and others with the natural and non-toxic compounds vanillin and 5-HMF, providing the proof-of-principle and roadmap for modern aromatic aldehyde drug candidates. The clinical efficacy of Voxelotor for SCD treatment is based on increased Hb levels and reduced hemolysis in patients. Although these surrogate endpoints are not long-term clinical outcomes, the phase III trial provided additional encouraging evidence that aromatic aldehydes may have disease-modifying potential that can mitigate adverse disease effects of RBC sickling.

[Context] The inherent nature of integral membrane proteins, in particular their partly hydrophobic character and correspondingly concerted folding in association with the membranous lipid bilayer, complicates their production and purification in a functional form. Moreover, their overexpression can have a significant impact on the host’s vitality limiting overall yields obtainable. In this context, cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) can be considered a valuable alternative.

Moreover, the generation of artificial hydrophobic environments by addition of supplements has proven useful for the production of membrane proteins. Nevertheless, these artificial environments only mimic the native surrounding membrane proteins encounter in the cellular context. As many membrane proteins are initially synthesized into the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before being transported to their final destinations, we established a cell-free protein synthesis system derived from cultured Spodoptera frugiperda 21 (Sf21) cells, which comprises endogenous ER membranes. These endogenous microsomal structures have been demonstrated to be translocationally active, thereby supporting the signal peptide mediated translocation of proteins across the membrane, and further provide functions such as signal peptide cleavage, N-glycosylation and lipid modifications. Moreover, proper folding of eukaryotic proteins is most likely facilitated by the inherent nature of the extract source.
[Question] How can cell-free protein synthesis help with the production of membrane proteins?
Choices:
1. The inherent hydrophobic character of integral membrane proteins and their concerted folding in association with the lipid bilayer makes their production and purification in a functional form challenging. Their overexpression can also significantly impact the host's vitality, limiting overall yields.
2. The artificial hydrophobic environments only mimic the native surroundings that membrane proteins normally encounter in the cellular context. Many membrane proteins are initially synthesized into the ER membranes before being transported, so artificial environments cannot fully recreate the native ER environment.
3. Cell-free protein synthesis lacks the constraints of the cellular plasma membrane, allowing protein production to be focused on the target protein. Conditions can also be directly adapted to account for the protein's individual requirements, like adding supplements to generate artificial hydrophobic environments.
4. The Sf21 cell-free system contains endogenous ER membranes, providing the native ER environment. The endogenous microsomal structures have been shown to be translocationally active, supporting signal peptide mediated translocation across the membrane. The ER membranes also provide functions like signal peptide cleavage, glycosylation, and lipid modifications to facilitate proper folding of eukaryotic membrane proteins.

[Context] In recent years, two-dimensional crystal structures have emerged as a fascinating new field of materials science. Owing to the easy fabrication via simple mechanical exfoliation, a variety of different material classes is readily available as a two-dimensional sheet, including large-gap insulators, superconductors and semiconductors, and the electronic structure of these ultimately thin layers can be very different from that of their corresponding bulk crystals. MoS2 and related transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as WS2 are among the most promising systems, while they are indirect-gap semiconductors in the bulk, a transition to a direct bandgap situated at the K points in the Brillouin zone occurs in single layers. Owing to the spatial and dielectric confinement, the optical spectra are governed by excitonic features, which are stable even at room temperature and exhibit anomalously large binding energies of about 0.5 eV (refs , , , ). This strong confinement also allows for the formation of more complex quasiparticles, such as trions, consisting of, for example, two electrons and a hole, and biexcitons, consisting of two electrons and two holes, with binding energies ranging from about 30 to 70 meV. The peculiar band structure with its non-equivalent valleys has direct consequences for the trions, which may form optically bright states using carriers located within one valley (intravalley trions) or in different valleys (intervalley trions). An energetic splitting (trion fine structure) between these states due to exchange interaction was recently predicted and observed for WSe2 (refs , ).
[Question] What are some of the excitonic features exhibited by single layer transition metal dichalcogenides?
Choices:
1. The optical spectra of single layer transition metal dichalcogenides are governed by excitonic features, according to the text. These excitons have anomalously large binding energies around 0.5 eV and are stable even at room temperature.
2. The text states that the strong confinement in 2D materials allows for the formation of more complex quasiparticles beyond excitons. These include trions, which consist of two electrons and a hole, and biexcitons, which consist of two electrons and two holes. These have binding energies on the order of 30-70 meV.
3. The text explains that materials with distinct valleys in their band structure can form optically bright intravalley trions using carriers in the same valley, or intervalley trions using carriers from different valleys. An energy splitting between these trion states arises from exchange interactions.

[Context] Here we tackle the issue of dendrite-induced shorting by developing a concept of backside metal plating. We use half-cells to illustrate our concept as shown in. shows a conventional Zn metal foil electrode, which serves as both reference and counter electrodes, directly facing the Cu working electrode. During Zn plating onto Cu foil in the conventional frontside plating configuration, Zn dendrites can grow towards the Zn reference electrode, causing battery shorting. In our concept demonstrated here (), the backside plating of Zn is realized by coating an insulating layer on the edges and the ‘front’ surface of Cu foil facing the Zn metal counter electrode. Thus, during Zn plating, Zn ions in the aqueous electrolyte travel over the edge and are deposited on the open back surface of Cu foil. Therefore, even if Zn dendrites form, they grow away from the counter electrode and do not short a battery. Looking into the ionic pathway in back plating configuration, Zn-related ions need to go around the insulating layer, to access the back surface of Cu foil. This configuration might seem to be a disadvantage, as it would cause a decrease of the rate capability. However, we note that the high ionic conductivity of 6 M aqueous KOH (0.6 S cm), a common electrolyte for conventional Zn-based batteries, can afford sufficient ion conduction for maintaining reasonable power rates. To put this into perspective, such a high ionic conductivity is ∼50–100 times of that of an organic electrolyte used in existing lithium ion batteries. Our experiments and numerical analyses demonstrate how this configuration maintains performance.
[Question] How does the text propose to tackle the issue of dendrite-induced shorting?
Choices:
1. The text proposes a concept of backside metal plating to prevent dendrite-induced shorting. This involves coating the front surface of the electrode facing the counter electrode with an insulating layer. During plating, metal ions travel around this layer to be deposited on the back surface of the electrode instead. This way any dendrites grow away from the counter electrode.
2. The text notes that the high ionic conductivity of the aqueous KOH electrolyte (0.6 S/cm) used in conventional Zn batteries can provide sufficient ion transport to maintain reasonable power rates. This is much higher than electrolytes in Li-ion batteries. Experiments and analyses in the text demonstrate the feasibility.
3. The concern is that the ions have to travel around the insulating layer to access the back surface, which could decrease the rate capability or power capability of the battery.

A particularly suitable feature of this methodology is the fact that sterically congested ortho-substituted benzaldehydes give products in high yields, which makes this approach a powerful tool for the construction of highly conjugated molecules comprising pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole (PP) units. Conversely, presence of two fused pentagonal rings in the center makes the pursuit of circularly conjugated species particularly complex, since it requires thermodynamically demanding closure of two heptagonal rings. In this regard, modern on-surface chemistry serves as a powerful synthetic tool toward bottom-up fabrication of complex nanostructures unattainable via solution chemistry. Many challenging syntheses of carbon-based nanostructures have been realized through this approach including atomically precise graphene nanoribbons, single-chirality single-walled carbon nanotubes, longest to-date acenes and periacenes, and embedment of non-hexagonal rings in PAHs.

However, a fundamental and economically important principle is that to achieve a convenient and practical chemical synthesis, the catalyst must be simple, effective and commercially available and/or easily accessible. In this regard, triphenylphosphine (PPh3)-based metal complexes are found to be expedient and advantageous for catalysis applications, since PPh3 is a stable and comparatively cheap ligand. Among PPh3-based Ru-complexes, RuCl2(PPh3)3 is considered to be the simplest and least expensive one and is also commercially available. Interestingly, RuCl2(PPh3)3 is known to catalyze a number of organic reactions. Herein we demonstrate that RuCl2(PPh3)3 is an efficient and highly selective homogeneous precatalyst for reductive amination, allowing the preparation of a variety of primary amines of industrial importance. By applying this Ru-precatalyst and starting from inexpensive and readily available carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones), ammonia and molecular hydrogen, we undertook the synthesis of functionalized and structurally diverse linear and branched benzylic, heterocyclic, and aliphatic amines including drugs and steroid derivatives. Another objective is to demonstrate up-scaling of the homogeneous amination protocol to gram-scale syntheses.

[Context] We postulate that combining weak supramolecular interactions with ligand–metal coordination would allow access to multiple state changes with directional control provided via the simple addition of guest <http://molecules.To|molecules.To> test this hypothesis, we choose to work with the bispyridine-functionalized calix[4]pyrrole 1.In the case of the pyridine-functionalized calix[4]pyrrole 1, this would have the effect of orientating the pyridyl nitrogen lone pairs in such a way that they might stabilize metal complexes with very different structures.Moreover, and in marked contrast to what is true for pure metal complexation-based systems, calix[4]pyrrole 1 would be expected to stabilize molecular ensembles that do not rely on metal coordination.Here we report that by using this mixed supramolecular–metal complexation approach it is possible to access six limiting states, namely a monomeric form 1, an infinite coordination polymer, [1•Ag]∞, and four types of anion- and cation-bridged capsule dimers, and to do so under conditions of controlled equilibria.The states in question are readily accessible in sequence from two different directions and they have been fully characterized both in solution and in the solid state.Finally, introduction of chirality, namely the use of a non-racemic pyridine calix[4]pyrrole 3, allows the system to operate off equilibrium in accord with the so-called “sergeant and soldiers” principle..

[Context] Pollen is the sole source of lipids and protein for bees, and varies widely in nutritional content, morphology, and chemistry. Pollen nutritional quality, including protein, is important for individual bee size and metrics of colony performance and pollen macronutrient ratio shapes bumble bee foraging preferences. Pollen quality also affects the expression of genes relating to host immune function, and pollen starvation increases the likelihood of bees dying when infected with a common gut pathogen. Previous work has shown that nectar chemistry can mediate bee disease, and one study found that pollen from different plant species affects honey bee tolerance of the pathogen Nosema ceranae and expression of immune genes. Thus, interspecific variation in pollen composition may have a critical but largely unknown effect not only on bee performance, but also interactions with pathogens.

[Context] Here we report that biliverdin is an endogenous ligand regulating NR2E3 and is a compound that contributes to the development of zebrafish retina. Biliverdin is a conserved green pigment synthesized from heme by heme oxygenase (HO) isozymes. HO isozymes are expressed in retina and other tissues, and their expressions are induced by light exposure. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (BVR) isozymes. We found that biliverdin from retinal extract specifically bound to NR2E3’s ligand-binding domain (NR2E3) in vitro. We also found that biliverdin induced NR2E3-dependent reporter gene expression in cells. Pharmacological inhibition of biliverdin synthesis in zebrafish larvae decreased the population of photoreceptor cells, and this phenotype was alleviated by exogenously supplied biliverdin. These results indicated that biliverdin is an endogenous small molecule regulating NR2E3 and a component contributing to the proper development of retinal photoreceptor cells.

[Context] For thermal transport, intriguing thermal transport properties of TSS have also been found in Bi2Te2Se thin films. A much enhanced Lorenz number was observed, which is possibly originated from the unique momentum and energy relaxation processes of the TSS, i. e. carriers relax much faster in momentum transfer than in energy transfer due to strong electron interaction within the Dirac system, thus, charge and electronic thermal currents are decoupled, similar to what was observed in graphene. The spin and energy relaxation dynamics has been shown by circularly-polarized pump-probe studies that spin depolarizes along with energy relaxation. Direct demonstration of momentum relaxation processes within TSS is lacking and is expected to be different from the case when there is TSS—conduction band interaction. Aside from direct measurements, it is known that momentum and energy relaxation times are related to electrical charge transport and thermal energy transport, respectively, and can be described equivalently by either Boltzmann transport equation or Landauer formalism. The thermoelectric effects, including the Seebeck voltage under temperature gradient and the Peltier heat flow accompanied by the electrical current, involve both momentum and energy transfer processes and thus correlate with both relaxation dynamics.

Ideally, the synthesized 2D oxide should be free of contamination from intercalating chemicals, dispersing agents and surfactants that could compromise its electrochemical performance owing to possible blockage of active sites and the added weight/volume of electrochemically inactive contaminants. In addition, the synthesis should be scalable for industrial manufacturing and production of large-size nanosheets with tunable compositions (for example, oxygen vacancies) to compensate for the poor conductivity often encountered in oxides. The current strategies for the production of 2D materials include gas-phase and solution syntheses. Gas-phase synthesis including chemical vapour deposition can produce large-size and high-quality 2D nanosheets on a substrate, but is hindered by a low yield. Solution-based processes, such as liquid exfoliation or chemical synthesis, are simple and scalable. However, these processes lead to small-size particles and have a higher probability of contamination from the synthetic process. One additional limit for exfoliation is its restriction to layered compounds. Only materials bonded by van der Waals or other weak forces in one direction can be easily cleaved by the intercalants. Therefore, the development of a general and scalable strategy for the synthesis of high-quality 2D oxides, including those with non-layered structures and investigation of their potential for pseudocapacitor applications are important.
[Question] Why is the development of a general and scalable 2D oxide synthesis strategy important?
Choices:
1. Current strategies include gas-phase synthesis like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and solution-based processes like liquid exfoliation or chemical synthesis. Gas-phase CVD can produce high-quality, large-size nanosheets but has low yield. Solution methods are simple and scalable but lead to small particles and contaminants. Exfoliation is also limited to layered compounds.
2. Ideally, the synthesized 2D oxide should be free of contamination from intercalating chemicals, dispersing agents and surfactants that could compromise its electrochemical performance. It should also be scalable for industrial manufacturing and production of large-size nanosheets with tunable compositions (e.g. oxygen vacancies) to compensate for the often poor conductivity of oxides.
3. A general scalable strategy is important to enable synthesis of high-quality 2D oxides, including non-layered structures. This would allow investigation of their potential for pseudocapacitor applications.
4. The volumetric capacitance, which relates to energy density, is increased by minimizing ion diffusion within the oxide lattice. The rate capability, which relates to power density, is increased by the same minimized ion diffusion. Therefore, maximizing volumetric capacitance and rate capability through design of the oxide lattice allows simultaneously achieving high energy and power density.

The self-assembly of 20 triangles seems an easier entry to icosahedral objects, rather than the assembly of 12 pentagons, certainly from a synthetic standpoint. Nature, however, appears to prefer the latter strategy, probably because it is more versatile in terms of subunit diversity and function. More importantly, the dodecahedron is the single option available for pentagonal tectons to self-assemble into a low-energy closed object, whereas triangular tiles can assemble in multiple ways, including a tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, and even a plane, as has been demonstrated by Nitschke.

[Context] Possible sources of background contamination with microfibres are numerous and can be caused by abrasions from synthetic clothing, inexpertly cleaned laboratory equipment, plastic tools used during processing, poorly sealed specimen or ambient air. Some basic precautionary measures and methods to prevent aerial microfibre contamination have been recommended in the scientific literature. Clothing made of cotton should be worn, air circulation should be avoided and work spaces and tools need to be cleaned from any particle contamination. The general elimination of microfibres from further analyses has also been postulated, considering all fibres to be artefacts of sample processing. However, this exclusion is no longer suitable to detect microfibres in environmental samples, as it distorts the factual results of contamination. Thus, an analytical assessment of airborne contamination levels is needed considering the laboratory-specific pollution with microfibres. Moist filter papers in Petri dishes exposed to the laboratory air could function as control blanks during an examination process. To avoid fibre contamination in the laboratory, hermetic enclosure devices like plastic covers and a pyramid glove box were also tested to isolate all work spaces during processing. Besides, textile fibre contamination was found to decrease, when processing was performed in a clean air flow cabinet. Other studies used common laboratory clean-air devices like laminar flow cabinets or fume hoods during sample processing.

Using the measurement information gathered from the energy responsive detector, the detector response function and the X-ray source spectrum, virtual monoenergetic (monoE) images can then be calculated. Due to the fact that the total attenuation at one specific energy can be expressed as a sum of all individual mass attenuation coefficients multiplied with their densities, solving a linear equation system leads to material decomposition which has already been discussed in the scientific community regarding quantification, accuracy and methodology. However, a mathematical limit is reached at a decomposition of two different materials by using two virtual monoE images and solving a simple linear equation system of two equations. A third equation at a further different energy would mean linear dependency and thus an infinite number of solutions of the system.

[Context] As well known, one of the important aspects of POM clusters is their high solubility in a variety of solvents, which can be readily prepared into uniform mother liquids for patterning POM materials through solution processing methods. However, commonly used solution evaporation method often lead to the failure in controlling the nucleate position because the continuous solution liquid film would break into random liquid domains in evaporation process. To solve this problem, many methods such as dip coating, inkjet printing and superwettable pattern have been developed to obtain patterned materials. More recently, the air-grid superwettable surfaces (e. g., superhydrophobic surfaces) are employed as templates in growing crystal arrays from aqueous solutions because the trapped air act as separating barriers to reduce the defect and non-uniformity of microcrystal patterning. For instance, McCarthy et al. fabricated controllable NaCl crystal arrays with the assistance of superhydrophobic surface via a simple dip-coating process. Simultaneously, Jiang and co-workers developed a technology for microcrystal patterning involving “clinging microdroplets”, revealing that superhydrophobic pillar-structured surfaces with high liquid-solid adhesion can be used to form microarrays including NaCl crystals, protein, microsphere, and nanoparticle aggregates. Then, Hatton and Aizenberg also patterned CaCO3 crystals deposition using a superhydrophobic post-structured surface, which can be utilized for the heterogeneous nucleation and localized growth of CaCO3 crystals from solution and avoiding nonspecific adsorption. In addition, some single-crystalline structures with excellent optoelectrical properties have recently been reported such as microplates, wires and belts.

They used triethylboron and ammonia as precursors, and via CVD, r-BN was produced on a sapphire substrate at 1500 °C and a pressure of 7 kPa. The addition of a small amount of SiH4 to the gas mixture was also studied, and it was found that Si atoms acted as surface-active substances that stimulated the formation of high-quality r-BN. Subsequently, they formed an AlN buffer layer by in-situ nitridation, and BN was grown under low pressure using H2 as a carrier gas at 1200–1500 °C. After SiC was used as the substrate, it was found that growth temperature was 1500 °C, the N / B ratio was 642 and the deposition pressure was 7 kPa favored r-BN epitaxial growth, and no buffer layer was required.

[Context] In addition, although the reaction requires magnesium ions for catalysis, no metal ions have been found in previously published MDD structures. This indicates that current structural models of MDDs may not provide sufficient information for elucidating the enzyme mechanism or designing effective inhibitors of MDDs.
[Question] Why might fully understanding the MDD mechanism and designing inhibitors require more structural information?
Choices:
1. The text states that magnesium ions (Mg2+) are required for catalysis of the reaction catalyzed by MDDs.
2. No, the text indicates that no metal ions have been found in previously published MDD structures. This suggests that the existing structural models may be incomplete.
3. The text states that the lack of metal ions in current MDD structures suggests those structures may not provide enough information to elucidate the mechanism of MDDs or design effective inhibitors. More complete structural information may be needed.
4. Since magnesium ions are needed for MDD catalysis but absent from current structures, those structures likely do not show the complete active site. Without visualizing how magnesium binds in the active site, the key chemical steps of the mechanism may remain unclear. Inhibitor design also relies on accurately representing the active site interactions.

[Context] The resulting elements are summed up (pooling operation) and the output is in turn transformed by means of a non-linear filter. The advantages of this procedure are manifolds, when applied to the problem of classifying superconducting material and anticipating their associated critical temperature. On the one side, the examined compound is associated to a set—of variable dimension—which reflects its chemical composition. In other words, we are feeding the neural network with the atomistic description of the material, a foundational approach solidly grounded on first principles that wipes out the load of arbitrariness intrinsic to any heuristic recipe. Feature engineering is carried out self-consistently, from the input set toward the ensuing aggregated representation, with no a priori imposed bias. Then, the extracted features are combined linearly at the pooling stage. This makes it possible to gauge the contribution of each individual atom to the onset of the superconductive transition. the whole is here the sum of its parts, a remarkable outcome of the automated feature selection strategy that is settled upon training. Interestingly, the encoding space can be successfully squeezed, even compactified to yield just one scalar output, so providing a handy and immediate proxy of the chemical propensity to superconductivity.
[Question] What is meant by ""compactifying the encoding space to one scalar output"" in the text?
Choices:
1. The linear combination of features at the pooling stage allows quantifying the contribution of each individual atom to the superconductive transition temperature of the material.
2. This means the high-dimensional feature representation extracted by the neural network can be compressed to a single numeric value representing the material's critical temperature. So the network encodes the complex atomic input into a simple one-dimensional output predicting superconductivity.
3. This phrase refers to how the neural network architecture automatically determines the contribution of each atom through feature extraction and pooling. So the superconductivity of the whole material emerges from the contributions of its individual atomic parts.

Four distinct adenosine receptors (ARs) have been described, A1, −2A, -2B, and -3, which differ in their affinity for adenosine and the biological effects of their associated signaling pathways. The inhibition of A1 and A3 ARs and the activation of A2A and A2B ARs adenylyl cyclase causing decreases and increases in the intracellular concentration of Cyclic Adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), respectively. The four ARs are widely involved in neurodegenerative, immune, cardiac, inflammatory disorders, cancer and bone homeostasis. A2B receptor (A2BR) is the most insensitive AR of the four.

Originally, it was developed to assess the nutrition status of elderly hospitalized patients. However, recent studies have shown that GNRI is a simple indicator of malnutrition where a lower GNRI is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality in HD patients. Nutrition status of HD patients can change because they follow dietary recommendations for patients with ESRD, restricting products rich in potassium, sodium, and phosphates.

[Context] One approach for extracting information on the multidecadal variability of groundwater recharge over centuries involves the analysis of chloride (Cl) concentration in the porewater from core samples from the vadose zone (i. e., from above the water table). This method is based on the premise that rain percolates vertically downward through the vadose zone so that each year’s recharging water displaces downward the previous year’s water. Therefore, the pore water found at different depths in this zone represents the layering of successive inputs of rainfall from the most recent, just below land surface, to the oldest now situated at the water table. The age of the water upon arrival at the water table determines how far back in time the method encompasses. The Cl approach is applicable in recharge areas in semi-arid climate regions where there is no Cl released from the geologic media and no contributions from anthropogenic sources. Where these geologic and anthropogenic conditions are met, the Cl in the vadose zone originates entirely from rainfall and dry atmospheric deposition on the land surface, which can be measured. After accounting for the Cl that is exported in surface runoff, the concentrating effect of surface evaporation and transpiration from the vegetation root zone causes the Cl concentration in the water that infiltrated below the root zone to be much greater than the equivalent aqueous concentration at the land surface. The concentration ratio of the Cl in the annual average atmospheric loading to the Cl in the pore water at any particular depth in the vadose zone is the recharge rate that produced the water found at that depth in the vadose zone. This is based on the premise that molecular diffusion has negligible effect on the Cl profile, in which case piston flow is a good approximation. The existing literature on the analysis of Cl concentration profiles as archives of past climate conditions pertains only to applications of the method in areas where sands and gravels (i.

[Context] GC-MS is the most widely used technique for plant metabolomics research to date, especially for facilitating the identification and quantification of the metabolites involved in the central pathways of primary metabolism such as sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, organic acids and polyamines. In this study, the metabolite profiling analysis in the roots of radish after the short-term exposure to Pb or Cd (72 h) stress has been performed using GC-MS analysis. Multivariate statistical tools including unsupervised principle component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) have been employed to reduce and visualize the complex metabolomics datasets. From that, a broad range of Pb- and Cd-responsive metabolites was quantified and the changes in several metabolic pathways were highlighted. Additionally, to reveal the integrative biochemical networks of the radish in response to Pb or Cd stress, the metabolomic data were integrated with our previous transcriptomic data, which provided a more global view of the molecular and cellular changes elicited by Pb and Cd exposure in radish. This work comprehensively provides the framework for a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern plant cell response to HM-induced stress in radish at a molecular level and the resulting information would facilitate the effective management of HM contamination in vegetable crops by genetic manipulation.

[Question] What challenges were encountered in previous attempts to use ABS to extract PSA?
Choices:
1. Compared to traditional polymer-based ABS, IL-based ABS offer a wider range of polarity between the two phases, allowing for more efficient extraction of proteins like PSA to one phase in a single step. They also have high water content, making them amenable environments for proteins.
2. IL-based ABS are aqueous biphasic systems formed by an ionic liquid and another compound like a polymer or salt. When dissolved in water above certain concentrations, the components of an IL-based ABS undergo phase separation, forming two immiscible aqueous phases.
3. Due to the low amounts of PSA as a biomarker, the levels extracted into the ABS phases were too low to quantify by other means. Immunoassays provide the sensitivity needed, but are expensive and not widely available.
4. Previous studies using dextran-ficoll ABS were unable to completely extract PSA into one single phase. The partition coefficients of PSA isoforms between the phases were quantified, but complete extraction was not achieved. This prevented the use of ABS as a sample pre-treatment method.

[Context] Interestingly, during a screening program for potential antiprotozoal drugs, the naturally occurring steroid 3β-amino-22,26-epiminocholest-5-ene (sarachine) from the leaves of Saraca punctate, had been isolated as a hit. Despite its simple substitution patterns, it was reported to exhibit activity against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and a series of amino steroids having side chains similar to that of sarachine were prepared from deoxycholic acid as the starting material. To this end, the most active derivative of this series contained a chloroquinoline moiety in the side chain, which might be contributing to biological activity. The advantage of employing hydrophobic steroid units is their membrane permeability, paving the way for biologically active hybrid molecules. On the basis of this knowledge ω-pyridiniumalkyl ethers of steroidal phenols were synthesized and indeed the combination of the hydrophobic steroid moiety with a hydrophilic group (ferrocenylmethylamino group, N-alkyl-pyridinium groups) led to compounds with antimicrobial activity. In continuation of this work, the 3-methoxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene unit was combined with the o-hydroxybenzylamino group and resulted in compounds with antimalarial activity which were systematically optimized using structure-activity relationship approaches.

[Context] ΔH is affected by the interaction forces between the molecular chains. Irregularity in the chains (e. g. co-monomer), small crystals and crystal imperfections result in smaller ΔH, and consequently, lower Tm. Drawn and longer molecular chains (typically for drawn polymer fibers) give larger interaction forces that increase ΔH and thereby Tm.ΔS is determined by the conformational possibilities of the molecular chains. If a polymer has an oriented molecular structure, the polymer tries to set back its isotropic structure upon heating, and relaxation and shrinkage occur. If relaxation is hampered (e. g. the fibers are fixed and their length cannot change), ΔS remains small, and Tm is higher. This phenomenon is called the overheating effect. Barkoula et al. studied the overheating effect for apolar (polyethylene and PP) and polar (polyamide 6 and polyethylene terephthalate) polymer fibers prepared with a home-built lab-scale melt-spinning device and concluded that the overheating effect is smaller for polar (8–10 °C) than apolar (20–25 °C) polymers. They produced PP fibers with different post-drawing temperatures and draw ratios and pointed out that the post-drawing temperature is the most beneficial around 140 °C and a draw ratio below 10 did not affect the morphology, thereby the melting temperature. At a higher draw ratio, λ = 14, there was a shift of 10 °C if the fiber was constrained.
[Question] How did post-drawing temperature and draw ratio affect the melting temperature of polypropylene fibers in Barkoula's study?
Choices:
1. The overheating effect refers to an increase in the melting temperature Tm when relaxation and shrinkage of an oriented polymer structure is constrained upon heating. Restricting the conformational freedom of the chains keeps the entropy of fusion ΔS small, resulting in a higher Tm.
2. Drawing polymer fibers aligns and extends the molecular chains. This results in larger interaction forces between the chains, increasing the enthalpy of fusion ΔH. The increased ΔH leads to a higher melting temperature Tm for drawn polymer fibers compared to undrawn fibers.
3. Barkoula et al. prepared apolar (polyethylene, polypropylene) and polar (polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate) polymer fibers using a lab-scale melt-spinning device. They constrained the fibers to prevent relaxation and shrinkage during heating. They found a smaller overheating effect for the polar vs. apolar polymers, with increases in Tm of 8-10°C and 20-25°C respectively.
4. Barkoula et al. produced polypropylene fibers with different post-drawing temperatures and draw ratios. They found the optimal post-drawing temperature was around 140°C. Increasing the draw ratio above 10 did not affect the fiber morphology or Tm. However, at a high draw ratio of 14, constraining the fiber led to a 10°C increase in melting temperature due to the overheating effect.

[Context] Typical biomarker assays rely on the use of luminescence—the luminescence signal is measured either as a result of a chemical reaction or as a photo-induced signal. Our choice, Lanthanide based photo-luminescent reporters are optimal in many ways because they provide an extremely sensitive, practically background free measurement option in gated, time-resolved signal acquisition mode. Furthermore, the Lanthanide ion itself has a very low absorption coefficient and requires a sensitizing “antenna”-moiety to be detected. This “antenna”-concept allows us to modify the luminescence by modulating the chemical environment that creates or cancels the antenna-effect in the unknown sample. The unique properties of lanthanide complexes as sensors and reporters are also widely studied providing ample literature from sensitizer-lanthanide configurations and ideas for various assay versions with different sensitivities and stabilities in different applications.

[Context] A few consensus sequences have been proposed for Rossmann-fold NAD(P)-binding proteins. Rossmann et al. first found the phosphate-binding sequence G-X1–2-G-X-X-G from an alignment of the sequences of dogfish lactate dehydrogenase, pig, lobster and yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and bovine glutamate dehydrogenase. However, this phosphate-binding motif is relatively short and exceptions to this motif have been found, so it would not be a reliable signature for Rossmann-fold NAD(P)-binding proteins. Subsequently, Kleiger and Eisenberg found G-X-X-X-[G/A] motifs following the phosphate-binding G-X1–2-G-X-X-G motif in flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and NAD(P)-binding Rossmann folds. They proposed an extended G-X1–2-G-X-X-G-X-X-X-[G/A] motif as an indicator of Rossmann folds that bind FAD or NAD(P). However, recent analyses showed that the fourth residue after the third conserved Gly in the G-X1–2-G-X-X-G motif is not a conserved Gly or Ala but is variable. Using geometric matching to cluster phosphate-binding sites of Rossmann-fold proteins with similar 3D structure, Brakoulias and Jackson found a variant of the G-X-G-X-X-G motif, namely, G-X-G-X-V-G and a new G-X-X-X-G-I-G motif. Because 1d motifs with similar structures depend on the cofactor type (NAD or NADP) and on the side chain orientations, 1d motifs derived without consideration of the cofactor type and/or local similarity of both backbone and side chain structures would not be reliable in annotating protein function from sequence alone.
[Question] What limitation to the extended motif proposed by Kleiger and Eisenberg was found by recent analyses?
Choices:
1. Recent analyses showed that the fourth residue after the third conserved glycine in the G-X1–2-G-X-X-G motif is not a conserved glycine or alanine as proposed, but is variable.
2. Kleiger and Eisenberg found that the G-X1–2-G-X-X-G motif proposed by Rossmann et al. was relatively short and some exceptions to the motif were found in some Rossmann-fold proteins. So it would not be a fully reliable signature for identifying all Rossmann-fold NAD(P)-binding proteins.
3. Using geometric matching, Brakoulias and Jackson identified a variant of the G-X-G-X-X-G motif, namely G-X-G-X-V-G, and a new G-X-X-X-G-I-G motif as phosphate-binding signatures in Rossmann-fold proteins.

[Context] Here, we report the enrichment and stable laboratory growth of an AigG4 species from GBS we designate Wolframiiraptor gerlachensis.After initial unsuccessful attempts to grow the species without amending growth media with spring water, analysis of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of W.gerlachensis suggested possible dependence on the biologically rare trace metal W, as evidenced by six annotated W-dependent ferredoxin oxidoreductases that could play central roles in anaerobic carbohydrate degradation.Indeed, stable cultivation of W.gerlachensis in a synthetic medium containing corn stover or a monosaccharide mix required the addition of W.NanoSIMS analysis demonstrated that xylose is the carbohydrate monomer preferred by W.gerlachensis in in-situ corn stover-degrading enrichments.Based on these experimental results and the genomic potential of the MAG, we propose that W is essential for carbohydrate metabolism and plays a critical role in one or more of the annotated W-dependent ferredoxin oxidoreductases, which could replenish reducing equivalents for a type-4 [NiFe] membrane-bound hydrogenase, producing a proton motive force.Using environmental metagenomes from three continents and a marine hydrothermal vent, we present evidence that both putative tungstate (WO4) transporters and tungstoenzymes were ancestral in this lineage, herein designated the family Wolframiiraptoraceae, and trace their evolution among 78 high-quality MAGs representing four genera and 11 species.While it is known that W is important for several archaeal groups, including methanogens, representatives of the Thermococcales and Thermoproteales are the only known archaea that require W for growth.Our investigation is unique in showing long-term W-dependent growth dynamics in a mixed culture, identifying W-requiring archaea outside of the Methanobacteriota (formerly Euryarchaeota), and demonstrating large-scale expansions of W-dependent enzymes in a microbial lineage..

[Context] Here, a high-performance triboelectric nanogenerator based on charge shuttling (referred as CS-TENG) is demonstrated. The CS-TENG introduces a mechanism of charge shuttling in conduction domains. With the interaction of two quasi-symmetrical domains, shuttling of two mirror charge carriers can be achieved to double the charge output. Meanwhile, the charges as the working medium in the domains are effectively generated by a charge pump strategy. An ultrahigh projected charge density of 1.85 mC m can be obtained in ambient conditions. Based on the CS-TENG, a high-performance integrated device for wave energy harvesting was fabricated and characterized in water wave environment, successfully demonstrating the technical feasibility of the CS-TENG as a fundamental device to be applied in complex structures for various practical applications. Our work provides insights into new modes of TENGs using unfixed charges in domains, shedding a new light on high-performance mechanical energy harvesting.

CeONPs have the possibility of functioning as substrate analogs and competitive inhibitors and CeONPs are unable to metabolize in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

[Context] UJT is known to occur during embryonic development, injury repair, tumor metastasis, and in the asthmatic airways. Both the UJT and the EMT potentiate epithelial plasticity and migration, but underlying mechanisms of UJT versus EMT are distinct. Unlike the case of the EMT, for example, in the case of the UJT the cell–cell junction and barrier function remain fully intact. The cardinal feature of the UJT, however, is the transition of the confluent epithelial collective from a solid-like, non-migratory, jammed phase to a fluid-like, migratory, unjammed phase. In the jammed epithelium, each cell remains in a fixed spatial relationship to each of its neighbors, as if the collective were frozen. Even though cell–cell junctions remain intact, the UJT enables these cells to unfreeze and thereby more readily swap positions with their neighbors and migrate in fluid-like swirling multicellular packs and eddies. This physical solid-to-fluid transformation is typified by dynamical, morphological, and mechanical alterations. This mechanical plasticity allows for rapid response to tissue perturbations while maintaining uncompromised barrier function. It also suggests the possibility of hijacking or disruption of these processes in epithelial diseases. But little is known about the energetic events that fuel these changes. Data presented here demonstrates that the unjamming cell layer undergoes a dramatic shift in energy metabolism toward glycolysis.
[Question] What dynamical, morphological, and mechanical changes occur in the UJT?
Choices:
1. Dynamically, cells transition from being 'frozen' in place to being able to migrate fluidly. Morphologically, cells change from a packed, solid state to a looser, fluid arrangement. Mechanically, the tissue gains plasticity and ability to rapidly respond to perturbations.
2. Unlike the EMT, in the UJT the cell-cell junctions and barrier function remain intact. The UJT enables cells to migrate while maintaining barrier function, whereas the EMT involves loss of cell junctions and barrier integrity.
3. The UJT involves transition of an epithelial collective from a solid-like, non-migratory state to a fluid-like, migratory state. Cells can readily swap positions and migrate in swirling packs while maintaining cell-cell contacts.

[Context] It is a fact that the course of the reaction depends on the biomass used and the pre-treatment process used, but in any case, despite numerous existing studies on the depolymerisation of lignin with sub/supercritical water, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved is lacking. According to the literature, in fact, depolymerisation can proceed either by ionic (hydrolysis) or by a radical (pyrolysis) path. In the ionic mechanism, the main reactions involved are hydrolysis, demethylation, alkylation, and demethoxylation. In particular, hydrolysis causes the breaking of the ether bonds, C–O–R, by water molecules. According to some authors the addition of basic substances such as Na2CO3, K2CO3, KOH, and NaOH to the reaction environment, promote a ionic pathway for the depolymerisation process. This happens because the presence of a carbonate or an alkaline cation polarizes the ethereal bond, thus shifting the reaction to the ionic cleavage of this bond. These reagents also show a catalytic function, suppressing not only the production of char but also increasing the oil yield and its quality. The effect of NaOH on the HTL of lignin was described by Roberts et al. According to their studies, the cleavage of the β–O–4 etheric bond occurs heterolytically via a six-membered transition state, a process by which the sodium cation and the hydroxide ions are also involved. Sodium cations form cationic adducts with lignin and polarize the ether bond. This leads to an increase in the negative partial charge on the oxygen atom, and reduces the energy required for the cleavage of the heterolytic bond. Moreover, they show that phenolic monomers are the primary products of lignin depolymerisation under basic conditions and subsequent oligomers are the result of consecutive condensation reactions between these monomers.

[Context] In light of this issue, the seminal work of Allen and Feldman (A-F), which expressed the TC of amorphous materials based on a mode diffusivity instead of MFP has therefore become widely accepted in understanding the phonon transport in amorphous materials, since it does not require one to define the phonon velocity. However, its limitation is that it does not include the effects of anharmonicity in the atomic interactions. Thus, it is interesting to consider how anharmonicity might affect the contributions of different modes in a material such as amorphous silica (a-SiO2), for which the A-F method does not exhibit satisfactory agreement with experiments. Here it is important to note that the only temperature dependence in the A-F model comes from the temperature dependent specific heat, while the Green-Kubo Modal Analysis (GKMA) method, employed herein is also able to include the temperature dependence of the mode diffusivities and frequencies.
[Question] Why is understanding the role of anharmonicity potentially important for modeling thermal conductivity in amorphous silica (a-SiO2)?
Choices:
1. The A-F model expresses thermal conductivity in terms of a mode diffusivity instead of mean free path, avoiding the need to define phonon velocity. However, it does not include effects of anharmonicity in atomic interactions.
2. The GKMA method can account for temperature dependence of both the specific heat capacity as well as the mode diffusivities and frequencies. The A-F model only includes temperature dependence through the specific heat capacity.
3. The A-F model is based on mode diffusivity instead of mean free path to avoid defining phonon velocity. The GKMA method calculates mode-specific contributions to thermal conductivity based on phonon velocities and mean free paths. So GKMA provides insights into individual phonon modes while A-F treats all modes together through diffusivity.
4. The A-F model does not show good agreement with experimental results for a-SiO2. Including anharmonicity effects may improve the model since the A-F model only includes temperature dependence via the heat capacity, while other methods like Green-Kubo modal analysis also capture temperature dependence of mode diffusivities and frequencies.

[Context] Despite their predominant lysosomal localization, a role for these proteases, including cathepsin L, in the nucleus has been reported. For example, the nuclear serpin myeloid and erythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein is a potent chromatin remodelling protein that also efficiently inhibits cathepsins V and L. Stefin B (cystatin B), another endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, specifically interacts with histones H2A. Z, H2B, H3 and cathepsin L in the nuclei of T98G astrocytoma cells. A serpin A3G, upon classical but not alternative activation of macrophages, exhibits increased localization in the nucleolus and colocalization with cathepsin L. Nuclear variants of cathepsins B and V are involved in the development of thyroid malignancies by modifying DNA-associated proteins. A role for cathepsin L in cleavage of the CUX1 transcription factor and the resultant acceleration of cell-cycle progression into S phase has also been described. Furthermore, cathepsin L deficiency is correlated with a global rearrangement of chromatin structure and a redistribution of posttranslationally modified histones.

We use microfluidics to apply piconewton pulling forces to individual actin filaments elongated by surface-anchored formin mDia1, and show that their elongation rate can thus be increased up to two-fold. This increase in elongation rate can be understood by considering that the pulling force favours the ‘open’ conformation of the FH2 dimer, in which an additional actin subunit can be added at the filament barbed end. The mechanical response of formin mDia1 is the same whether the pulling force is applied at the N-terminal side of the FH1 domain or at the C-terminal side of the FH2 domain. We also show that formin mDia1 remains processively bound to the barbed end of a depolymerizing filament which is being pulled on, and that the pulling force slows down depolymerization.

[Context] This work is on a dual magnetic field and electric field tunable Y-type hexagonal ferrite filter. The magnetic field H tuning of the filter was accomplished with a built-in permanent magnet and the electric field E tuning was facilitated by the recently reported nonlinear magnetoelectric (NLME) effect in M- and Y-type hexagonal ferrites. Application of a pulsed or DC electric field to the ferrite was found to result in variations in the magnetization and magnetocrystalline anisotropy field and the changes in these order parameters were proportional to E. Although a first principles theory for the non-linear ME effects is lacking at present, the likely cause of the modification of magnetic parameters in an electric field and the consequent tuning of FMR is related to hopping type electrical conduction current in the ferrites. Since the Fe ions involved in the conduction process are effectively excluded from contributing to magnetic interactions, one may anticipate weakening of both the super-exchange interaction and the strength of spin–orbit coupling. This leads to variations in the magnetization and anisotropy field and results in tuning of the frequency of magnetic modes. The changes in the magnetic parameters resulted in tuning of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency, with the frequency changes being proportional to the DC electric power applied to the sample. Thus, the use of the hexagonal ferrite as the coupling element in a band-pass filter resulted in E or current tunability of the device. In the following sections we discuss the filter design and its H- and E-tuning characteristics.
[Question] How was the magnetic field (H) tuning of the filter accomplished?
Choices:
1. The work focuses on a dual magnetic field and electric field tunable Y-type hexagonal ferrite filter. Specifically, it examines magnetic field tuning using a permanent magnet and electric field tuning using the nonlinear magnetoelectric (NLME) effect in hexagonal ferrites.
2. The likely cause is electrical conduction currents in the ferrites related to hopping of Fe ions. The Fe ions involved in conduction are excluded from magnetic interactions, which weakens the super-exchange interaction and spin-orbit coupling. This leads to changes in magnetization and anisotropy when an electric field is applied.
3. The changes in magnetic parameters of the hexagonal ferrite coupling element caused by the NLME effect lead to changes in the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency. Since the FMR frequency changes were proportional to the applied electric power, this allowed electric field tuning of the filter's characteristics.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no clinical trial has been conducted using these methods for duodenal SEMS fixation. Endoscopic suturing device is not available for clinical use in our country. therefore, we conducted this pilot study to evaluate the technical feasibility and clinical effectiveness of duodenal PC-SEMS fixation using OTSC in patients with mGOO.

[Question] What is nematic liquid crystals?
Choices:
1. Nematic liquid crystals are made of rod-like particles that tend to align along a common direction, termed the director. They have orientational order but no positional order.
2. Active nematics are nematic liquid crystals where the particles consume energy and are self-propelled. This destroys the long-range nematic order and leads to active turbulence with chaotic flows.
3. Topological defects are singularities in the orientation field where the molecules cannot align continuously along the director. There are two main types: +1/2 comet-like defects and -1/2 trefoil-like defects. The number refers to the change in orientation of the molecules around the defect.
4. In active nematics, topological defect pairs are continuously created and +1/2 defects become motile and move apart. In contrast, in passive nematics +1/2 and -1/2 defects simply annihilate when they meet.

[Context] In summary, p-n heterojunction diodes were fabricated using n-type MoS2 films with varying thicknesses and p-Si substrates. MoS2 thin films are laterally in contact with p-Si substrates over the substrate area, allowing for direct exposure to incident light of varying intensity. Electrical measurements revealed that the n-type MoS2/p-Si diodes have good rectifying behavior as well as clear photoconductive characteristics. The photocurrent of the device has a strong dependence on the MoS2 film thickness whereby the thicker MoS2 films produce more photocurrent due to their increased volume for photon absorption. This demonstrates the potential to control the photocurrent of MoS2/Si diodes by modulating the thickness of the MoS2 layer. The spectral response of the device showed that there are contributions from direct and indirect band transitions in the multilayer MoS2 film. We further observed a substantially extended spectral range for our device into the visible range.

Choices:
1. Disk drives utilizing GMR sensors and MTJs with TMR sensors have been extremely successful commercially. MTJs are also used in magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), though this is currently still a niche application.
2. GMR and TMR devices have a relatively low magnetoresistance (MR) ratio, which is the ratio between the resistances in the parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) states. Typical values are only a couple hundred percent, much lower than the on/off current ratios in CMOS transistors.

[Context] The N-terminus of BICD2 is able to induce the formation of processive dynein/dynactin complexes. Importantly, BICD2 CC3 interacts with the CC1 region, reducing the dynein/dynactin-binding activity of the N-terminus, thus effectively acting as an auto-inhibitory domain. The CC3 region also interacts with Rab6, a small GTPase involved in the control of membrane traffic, that links the adaptor (and through it dynein) to the Golgi apparatus and exocytotic vesicles. The current model for the regulation of BICD2 (and possibly other BICD family members) suggests that binding of cargo such as Rab6 to the C-terminus releases the N-terminal region from its embrace, “opening” the molecule and favoring the formation of active complexes with dynein and dynactin. Rab6 is thought to be the major interacting cargo of BICD2 during G1 and S and in non-dividing cells. In early G2, however, BICD2 switches cargos and binds the nucleoporin RanBP2/NUP358, resulting in its accumulation at the nuclear envelope where it recruits dynein and dynactin. RanBP2 phosphorylation by the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1 favors its interaction with BICD2, although possibly other regulatory inputs exist. Additionally, other nuclear proteins such as Nesprin-2 collaborate in recruiting BICD2/dynein to the nuclear membrane.

[Context] Finally, here we conclude the structural characterization of the CsmA baseplate by presenting the high-resolution structure of the CsmA carotenosome baseplate. ssNMR data provide structural information in terms of distances and dihedral angle constraints. However, due to the local nature of these constraints, it was not possible to calculate the structure of the baseplate using these constraints alone. Therefore, the ssNMR data was complemented with a 3D density model derived using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) providing constraints for the global structure of the baseplate. Due to considerable variation in the quaternary structure of the carotenosomes (different lengths and curvatures, see below) it was only possible to derive a three-dimensional (3D) density model of medium-low resolution. Previously, ssNMR and microscopy data have been combined for high-resolution structure determination of supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, the unique composition of chlorosome complexes containing aggregates of bacteriochlorophyll molecules provide unique opportunities for near infrared spectroscopy, which is highly sensitive to ligand conformations, for comparing experimental data with structure-based ab initio calculated spectra. Here we derive structure constraints and validation of the structure in terms of orientation between BChl a pigments. We compare the observed and ab initio structure using back-calculated data from absorption spectra, linear dichroism (LD) and circular dichroism (CD) in both isotropic and anisotropic phase (ACD, oriented samples).

The serially input data directly enter the PTFP and the output result is yielded serially. Namely, tensor convolution is completed as the input tensor ‘flows’ through the photonic circuit. This is achieved by the hybrid manipulation of optical wavelengths, time delays, and space dimensions. Kernel weights are implemented inside the microring resonators (MRRs) of the PTFP and data registering is accomplished by the embedded optical delay structure. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we implement a silicon-based integrated photonic chip to conduct the key functionalities of the PTFP, i. e. the hybrid manipulation of wavelengths and time delays.

[Context] Polymer brushes, or polymer chains end-tethered to a surface through covalent or coordinative interactions, represent an interesting class of soft materials. The conformational flexibility and functional versatility inherent to these systems make polymer brushes an attractive platform for many applications in nanotechnology and biotechnology. More importantly, grafting polymers onto NCs introduces new energetic contributions arising from polymer chain conformational entropy and interaction enthalpy. These energetic contributions can be readily tailored by the control of the polymer’s molecular weight, chemical nature, architecture, persistence length and surrounding solvent. Therefore, the incorporation of polymeric ligands would greatly expand the parameter space for the design of ordered particle brush solids. Over the past several decades, extensive experimental and theoretical efforts have been devoted to studies of various particle-polymer brush hybrid materials. Several recent examples of self-organization of polymer-grafted NCs into ordered assemblies have demonstrated the formation of single-component two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal lattices. In contrast, limited success has been achieved in creating more complex, binary arrays of polymer-grafted NCs with both two- and three-dimensional (3D) order.

However, in practice, emitters exist in close proximity (often a few nanometers apart) leading to dense areas containing many localizations with low precisions.

While the results are encouraging with a TER of ∼500% using these oligomers, the homogeneity of the current is questionable considering the roughness (4 nm r. m. s. for a 7.2-nm film) and large size (0.3 mm diameter) of the junctions. Moreover, the electronic transport mechanism at play is still unidentified. Alternatively, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) homopolymer and its copolymers with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)) are robust organic ferroelectrics. These copolymers are promising candidates for TER since their ferroelectric character persists down to nanometre thicknesses. conductance switching was observed at the local scale using scanning probe microscopy across 1-nm-thick P(VDF-TrFE) films and in capacitors based on 10-nm-thick P(VDF-TrFE) films. However, solid-state FTJs based on ultrathin PVDF-based films have not yet been reported and the fundamental physics of TER in organic FTJs remains to be explored.

[Context] Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly malignant brain tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. Standard therapies, including surgery, chemotherapy (temozolomide—TMZ), radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and targeted therapy, are frequently ineffective because numerous patients with GBM do not respond to TMZ as the tumor is resistant to treatment.

[Context] Current delivery systems are reporter-specific and generally custom-made by covalently linking fluorescent reporters to particles (1–10 μm) such as latex beads or bacterial wall fragments. For example, covalently attached pHrodo on bacterial-particles and dextran-particles have become a gold standard to track phagocytosis and endocytosis, respectively. However, not all fluorescent dyes are amenable to covalent binding and chemical modification can compromise or eliminate the reporting properties of the dye, limiting the potential scope of this approach to a narrow range of molecules that retain their activity after binding. Alternative strategies are similarly limited. For example Modi et al recently reported the development of a DNA I-switch to monitor endosomal pH using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Although those nanosensors function adequately, they are limited by cost and scalability given that new designs are required for each condition to be sensed. Non-covalent delivery systems have traditionally been hindered by multiple constraints. Physical encapsulation of dyes in a polymer matrix often generates heterogeneity in the system and the leaching of the sensor dyes causes instability, thus reducing the life time and reproducibility of the sensor. Thus, there is a significant unmet need to develop a platform delivery vehicle that could be loaded with a wide range of reporters without covalent modification and that could be readily internalized into multiple intracellular compartments including the cytoplasm and nucleus. Ideally, once internalized the vehicle/reporter construct should remain stable and rapidly, reversibly and reproducibly respond to and report intracellular physiology in real-time.
[Question] What are some examples of current reporter delivery systems and their limitations?
Choices:
1. An ideal system would allow loading of a wide range of reporters without covalent modification. It should be internalized into multiple intracellular compartments like the cytoplasm and nucleus. Once internalized, it should remain stable and be able to rapidly, reversibly, and reproducibly report intracellular conditions in real-time.
2. Systems using reporters covalently linked to particles like pHrodo on bacteria particles for phagocytosis tracking have limited scope due to dye compatibility issues. FRET nanosensors for endosomal pH sensing require new designs for each target. Non-covalent dye encapsulation in polymers can cause dye leaching and sensor heterogeneity.
3. Current systems have limitations like dye compatibility for covalent particle linkage, cost and design scalability for FRET nanosensors, and dye leaching/instability for polymer encapsulation. An improved system is needed that overcomes these limitations and allows flexible loading of diverse reporters, internalization into multiple compartments, and real-time intracellular reporting.
4. Current systems often require covalent linkage of reporters to particles which can be difficult for some dyes and can compromise reporter function. Other systems like FRET nanosensors are limited by cost and scalability as new designs are needed for each target. Non-covalent systems face issues with dye leaching causing sensor instability and heterogeneity.

[Context] With the tremendous advancements in technology especially related to image capturing and video capturing, there has been a multi-fold increase in the number of applications making use of the same. The image capturing or video capturing systems are expected to operate not only in presence of appreciable light but also in low light, especially during the night times. With the application extending to such cases, the low light images that are captured by the systems are not clear enough to serve the purpose of what they are supposed to serve. The images which are captured in low light are susceptible to a decrease in contrast as well as a reduction in its resolution. The scene details may also appear to be blurred with a reduction in the image resolution. This creates a serious concern especially when the image capturing or video capturing systems are being used for security surveillance. The application areas where low light images are usually appearing include medical imaging, which again is a critical application where the image resolution is of prime importance. Since the application areas involve such serious use cases, low light image enhancement finds its application more as a necessity rather than a mere feature.
[Question] How does low light affect the quality of captured images?
Choices:
1. For applications like medical imaging and security surveillance, clear and high-resolution images are critical. The low light conditions these systems have to operate under render images unusable without enhancement. Thus for these applications, low light image enhancement is a necessity, not just an added feature.

[Context] Nanomedicine has recently gained widespread attention for cancer treatment due to improved drug solubility and bioavailability, increased site-specific targeting, reduced systemic toxicity, and incorporation of multiple components that impart multi-functionality for diagnosis and therapy. Stimuli-responsive or ‘smart’ polymer-based nanoparticle systems can undergo rapid, reversible phase transitions in response to external stimuli, thereby releasing their contents at the site of interest “on demand.” Due to these advantages, we proposed to develop a stimuli-responsive core-shell nanoparticle system conjugated with folic acid and containing two different drugs, for targeted combination treatment of lung cancer. In this research, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) was copolymerized with biodegradable carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) to form a semi-interpenetrating network (IPN) to impart both pH- and temperature-sensitivity and degradability to the final product by cleavage of CMC-PNIPAAm bond. PNIPAAm and chitosan are two commonly used thermo-responsive and pH-responsive polymers, respectively. The method of polymerization of PNIPAAm and CMC has been done previously to form IPN hydrogels. The PNIPAAm-CMC combination formed the shell of the nanoparticle (NP) system while the core consisted of poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) and imaging contrast agents such as iron oxide. The PLGA allows controlled release of the encapsulated compounds while superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) can be used for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and to induce temperature changes using an external alternating magnetic field for hyperthermia therapy or radiofrequency ablation, if needed.

In some scenarios, these same spin fluctuations also lead to nematic electronic order, identified by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic (T–OR) structural transition. In this context, nematicity corresponds to orientational order between two AFM sublattices that are only weakly coupled because of frustration that arises from large next-nearest-neighbour magnetic interactions.

[Context] The bandgap of CQDs can, in contrast with those of the best perovskites, be tuned into the SWIR.However, the processing steps required for the assembly of CQDs into films are typically associated with the formation of an appreciable density of electronic trap states arising from incompletely-passivated nanoparticle surfaces.A new type of semiconducting material, one that consists of CQDs embedded in an epitaxially grown perovskite matrix, has been recently reported.These quantum-dot-in-perovskite (QDiP) materials combine the advantages of each.CQD sensitization (therefore, bandgap tunability), superior passivation of the CQD surface states in view of their epitaxially matched interface, and the excellent carrier transport properties with low-trap density and high mobility of organohalide perovskites.Therefore, in principle, QDiP solids offer an attractive platform for infrared photodetection..

[Context] Understanding the operating principles of inter-conversion between collective (E/M) and these different individual modes of migration (A, A/M, M) requires analyzing the coupling of core regulatory circuits of EMT/MET and AMT/MAT. These two regulatory circuits are coupled through the microRNAs, miR-200 and miR-34, that inhibit both RhoA as well as Rac1. Therefore, the coupled circuit contains links that are both translational (through microRNAs) and post-translational (through GTPases) in nature. These interactions can potentially give rise to novel dynamical features that are not observed in circuits composed of only transcription factors, or those with both transcription factors and microRNAs. This inherent complexity in the coupled system explains why the transitions between collective and solitary migration phenotypes have received limited theoretical attention.

[Context] We show in this paper that domain-specific TP53 mutants exhibit distinct, tissue-independent cellular activities that modulate key growth signaling pathways. Specifically, we find that TAD and DBD mutants modulate canonical and non-canonical functions of EGFR through their common ability to bind and stabilize EGFR. TAD mutants promote EGFR-mediated signaling through enhancing EGFR interaction with AKT via a known mutant p53 interactor, DDX31. In contrast, DBD mutants promote EGFR activity in the nucleus by blocking EGFR’s interaction with SHP1. The effects of mutant p53 reported here differ from ‘classical’ transactivation of novel gene targets, but rather, are mediated through stabilization or disruption of distinct protein signaling complexes. These previously unrecognized mechanisms of domain-specific mutant p53 are significant not only in furthering our understanding of how different classes of TP53 mutants exert pro-carcinogenic GOF effects, but may also guide clinical stratification, and the development of therapeutic approaches that exploit common dependencies in tumors wherein p53 and/or EGFR function have been perturbed.

[Context] In addition to the frictions between tips and substrates, frictions between surfaces have also been studied. Many experiments have demonstrated that superlubricity exists between graphite microflakes. The self-retracting motion of graphite microflakes creates gigahertz-level nanoelectromechanical systems. However, generating a stable oscillation is difficult because of the rapid loss of the kinetic energy of the microflakes in the self-retracting process. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to investigate energy dissipation in sliding friction, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the mechanism of energy dissipation of sliding microflakes remains ambiguous. In particular, the dependence of the sliding distance of a microflake on its initial velocity has not been studied quantitatively. The current study used a modified Frenkel–Kontorova (FK) model and demonstrated that the sliding distance of a 1D atom chain (1DAC) is mainly determined by its initial velocity. When the initial velocity of a 1DAC is at a special value, although this value is very large, the 1DAC cannot move far. The physical mechanism of such a strange phenomenon was investigated in detail. The results showed that when the initial velocity of 1DAC is at a special value, the kinetic energy of 1DAC dissipates because of phonon excitations, which lead to a short sliding distance of 1DAC. All other initial velocities lead to superlubric sliding of 1DAC. In addition, the coupling strength between 1DAC and the substrate and the size of 1DAC exert a significant influence on the relationship between sliding distance and initial velocity.
[Question] How does the coupling strength and size of 1DAC affect the relationship between sliding distance and initial velocity?

* Coupling strength: When the coupling strength between 1DAC and the substrate is strong, the kinetic energy of 1DAC dissipates more easily, leading to a shorter sliding distance at a given initial velocity.

Choices:
1. ""Template Matching"" recognizes the extent of agreement between a user-defined template and an image. It may not be sufficient for recognizing multiple shapes or colors in a single image, as is needed to analyze multiple test zones on paper-based devices. The template would need to be designed meticulously to capture all potential variations.
2. This plugin can perform automated feature recognition based on a reference template defined by the user. To use it for paper-based devices, the reference template would need to capture the expected size, shape and color features of each analysis zone. The plugin could then be used to recognize and align those features from an image of the device to the template. Some customization may be needed to recognize multiple distinct features.
3. Existing ImageJ plugins like ""ReadPlate"" are designed for standard well plate geometries. Paper-based devices have custom, non-linear designs. To analyze them, the plugin would need to be modified to allow the user to define a custom grid of circular ROIs based on the number of zones, their coordinates, and diameters instead of relying on predefined well plate dimensions.

[Context] In this light, atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), rhenium disulfide (ReS2), tin diselenide (SnSe2) and black phosphorus (BP), are expected to offer attractive material platforms for NDR devices due to the absence of dangling bonds on their surfaces. Because these 2D semiconductor layers are stacked via weak van der Waals interaction, 2D materials-based heterojunctions do not suffer from lattice mismatch and form atomically sharp interfaces, allowing high-quality heterojunction interfaces. It is also possible to design various heterojunctions by stacking different 2D materials with different bandgaps and electron affinities, where band structure alignment can be classified into three types. type-I (straddling gap), type-II (staggered gap) and type-III (broken gap). Recently, Roy et al. reported an NDR device based on an MoS2/WSe2 heterostructure, which was fabricated in a type-II heterojunction. However, the NDR device used dual gates involving a complicated fabrication process to obtain an electrostatically doped n/p heterojunction, and the NDR behaviour was observed at a very low temperature below 175 K. Nourbakhsh et al. and Yan et al. also reported NDR devices in MoS2/WSe2 and BP/SnSe2 heterojunctions, respectively. In these devices, it was necessary to use the specific thickness of 2D semiconductors to ensure band-to-band tunnelling of carriers, and the obtained peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) values were lower than 2 at room temperature.
[Question] Why are 2D semiconductor layers stacked via weak van der Waals interaction good for forming heterojunctions for NDR devices?
Choices:
1. Because the 2D semiconductor layers are stacked via weak van der Waals interaction, they do not suffer from lattice mismatch and can form atomically sharp interfaces. This allows the formation of high-quality heterojunction interfaces, which is important for NDR devices.
2. Some examples of atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors that are expected to be good candidates for NDR devices include molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), rhenium disulfide (ReS2), tin diselenide (SnSe2) and black phosphorus (BP).

[Context] Multiple studies report the association between Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and Alzheimer’s disease. Other members of the Herpesviridae family have been implicated, particularly EBV, CMV and HHV6. Several viruses are capable of latent residency in the peripheral nervous system and target, in acute cases of encephalitis (for HSV1/2 and EBV), the same regions of the central nervous system (temporal and frontal cortex, and hippocampus) affected in AD.
[Question] Why does the tropism of HSV1, HSV2, and EBV for certain brain regions support their potential role in Alzheimer's disease?
Choices:
1. Other members of the Herpesviridae family that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6).
2. The temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and hippocampus are affected in both Alzheimer's disease and acute encephalitis from HSV1/2 and EBV infection. This provides evidence these viruses could be involved in Alzheimer's pathogenesis.
3. Since these viruses target the same brain regions (temporal lobe, frontal lobe, hippocampus) affected in Alzheimer's disease when they cause acute encephalitis, it supports the hypothesis that they could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis by infecting those vulnerable areas over time.

[Context] Klotho gene is mainly expressed in the kidney and in the brain choroid plexus, and it encodes for two transcripts. The full length (m-KL) generates a type I transmembrane protein presenting two homologous extracellular domains, KL1 and KL2. The extracellular portion can be shed by proteolytic cleavage, generating processed KL (p-KL), also known as soluble KL, containing both KL1 + KL2 domains. Additionally, the KL1 and KL2 domains, can be shed generating independent soluble subunits. Alternatively, a second transcript generates a shorter mRNA which presents a stop codon short after the KL1 domain, generating a secreted isoform (s-KL). Although recent reports doubt if this endogenous transcript produces a functional protein, different groups have reported that increasing the levels of s-KL or KL1 through recombinant protein administration or gene transfer approaches confers clear beneficial properties. Klotho can modulate several pathways related to aging progression, which include among others, the inhibition of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/insulin signaling and Wnt pathways, involved in senescence and fibrosis, respectively. It also reduces oxidative stress and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, reducing cellular damage during aging. Besides, KL also plays a key role in mineral metabolism, where it is involved in direct modulation of ion channels, PTH hormone production, vitamin D regulation and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) hormone signaling. For more details on KL anti-aging functions, see the review by Abraham and Li, 2022.
[Question] What are some of the key anti-aging pathways modulated by Klotho?
Choices:
1. The Klotho gene is mainly expressed in the kidney and in the choroid plexus of the brain.
2. The Klotho gene encodes two main transcripts. The full length transcript (m-KL) generates a type I transmembrane protein with two homologous extracellular domains called KL1 and KL2. The second transcript generates a shorter mRNA with a premature stop codon after the KL1 domain, producing a secreted isoform called s-KL.
3. The full length m-KL transcript generates a transmembrane protein that can be cleaved to produce soluble KL (p-KL) containing both KL1 and KL2 domains. The KL1 and KL2 domains can also be shed independently as soluble subunits. The shorter s-KL transcript generates a secreted form containing only the KL1 domain.
4. Klotho inhibits insulin/IGF-1 signaling and Wnt signaling, which are involved in senescence and fibrosis respectively. It also reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, limiting aging-related damage. Klotho also plays a role in mineral metabolism by modulating ion channels, PTH, vitamin D, and FGF23 hormone signaling.

LTα1β2 is expressed on activated T, B and natural killer cells, and interacts with LTβR on DC, monocyte lineage cells and stromal cells. Murine array data suggest that Tregs express elevated levels of LTα compared with other T cells.

[Context] Although it can be argued that high abundance of EcM plants is a consequence rather than a driver of high soil C stocks, a large body of recent findings provides evidence that EcM symbionts may be the key drivers of topsoil carbon accumulation through two interacting mechanisms. First, EcM fungi produce greater biomass of more recalcitrant mycelium compared to AM fungi. Second, while EcM fungi are more efficient in taking up N in N-poor soils than AM fungi or roots, EcM fungi immobilize most of the N in their own biomass. This suppresses saprotrophic decomposition process and reinforces the competitive advantage of EcM and ErM plants via enhanced N limitation.
[Question] What two interacting mechanisms may allow ectomycorrhizal (EcM) symbionts to be key drivers of topsoil carbon accumulation?
Choices:
1. High soil carbon provides favorable conditions for EcM plants due to nitrogen limitation. Therefore, the proliferation of EcM plants could be a consequence of high soil carbon rather than the cause of high soil carbon. However, evidence suggests EcM symbionts actively drive further carbon accumulation through mechanisms like recalcitrant mycelium production and nitrogen immobilization.
2. By efficiently taking up nitrogen but immobilizing it in their own biomass rather than making it available to plants, EcM fungi suppress saprotrophic decomposition processes in the soil. This reinforces the competitive advantage of EcM plants through enhanced nitrogen limitation. The suppressed decomposition allows more carbon to accumulate in the soil.
3. The recalcitrant nature of EcM fungal mycelium means it is harder to decompose. Therefore, the greater production of this fungal mycelium by EcM symbionts leads to accumulation and storage of more carbon in the soil.
4. The two interacting mechanisms are: 1) EcM fungi produce greater biomass of more recalcitrant mycelium compared to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, and 2) EcM fungi are more efficient at taking up nitrogen (N) in N-poor soils than AM fungi or roots, but EcM fungi immobilize most of the N in their own biomass.

[Context] B = S, Se, Te), has attracted great amount of attention in the past few years, due to its switching effects, high thermoelectric power and good photovoltaic properties. Unlike Bi2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Te3, Sb2Se3 was thought to be topological trivial. However, it was recently theoretically predicted that Sb2Se3 could transform from band insulator to topological insulator under high pressure and thereafter the prediction of topology was experimentally elucidated. Here, we report the effect of pressure on the transporting properties of Sb2Se3 in combination with structural studies through Raman spectra and in situ angle-dispersive synchrotron x-ray diffraction (AD-XRD). Our experiments indicated that Sb2Se3 transformed from insulator into metal like state and further to superconductive state as increase of pressure, during which there was no crystal structure phase transition occurred in our studied pressure range. Two new Raman active modes were observed at high pressure, respectively, where correspondingly the superconductivity emerges and the dTC/dp slop changes.

1. It was recently theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed that Sb2Se3 could transform from a band insulator to a topological insulator under high pressure.

[Context] Carbonaceous particles (CNPs), which are generally formed during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, continue to increase in the environment as a result of agriculture, industry, permanent deforestation, savanna fires and motor vehicles. Upon their release into the atmosphere, CNPs might serve as condensation nuclei, which are the second largest contributors to climate change. CNPs are of environmental concern for several other reasons as well. For example, CNPs have been identified as a carcinogen and a cause of some respiratory diseases. CNPs can also act as a carrier for pollutants, such as persistent organic pollutants, due to their unique properties, which include a large specific surface area and high affinity for various pollutants. These particles mainly enter the marine system through fluvial discharge and atmospheric deposition. Most CNPs are also commonly regarded as a chemically and biologically stable form of carbon and may persist in the marine or soil system for a long period of time, thus acting as an important sink in carbon cycling. While the dissolved organic matter might play an important role in the carbon cycle of the ocean, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the effect of CNPs on the marine DOC pool. In addition, the aggregation and sedimentation of DOC polymers are two interrelated processes that determine the downward flux and the fate of the particles within the marine system.

[Context] In mammalian neurons, a subset of mRNAs are specifically targeted to dendrites. These mRNAs are believed to be kept in a translationally dormant state after exiting the nucleus until specific synaptic signals initiate local protein synthesis at synapses. The molecular details of this regulation are only partially understood. For example, several dendritic transcripts initiate translation in a 5′cap-independent manner using so-called internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) that recruit ribosomes directly to a start codon without the assembly of initiation factors at the 5′-end of the mRNA. Importantly, many dendritically localized mRNAs encode proteins that are highly concentrated at postsynaptic densities (PSDs), such as SAPAP3, different Shank/ProSAP family members (Shanks) and PSD-95/SAP90. PSDs are dense cytoplasmic protein signaling networks associated with the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses. SAPAP3, Shanks and PSD-95 are master scaffolding proteins of the PSD that cross-link neurotransmitter receptors, signaling molecules and cytoskeletal components. While SAPAP3 mRNAs have not yet been shown to be specifically translated at synapses, an activity triggered local synthesis of PSD components at synapses is generally believed to induce a reorganization of the postsynaptic signal transduction machinery and thereby regulate synaptic plasticity. Consistently, SAPAP3 knockout mice exhibit a behavior reminiscent of obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans suggesting that a tight control of SAPAP3 levels in mammalian brain neurons is essential to maintain normal synaptic physiology. Here we show that the regulation of SAPAP3 levels is exerted at the level of translation. A particular uORF strongly down-regulates translation efficiency while also enabling the synthesis of two distinct SAPAP3 isoforms via alternative translation initiation.

[Question] Why does chitosan dissolve in acidic medium but form a hydrogel when neutralized?
Choices:
1. The amino groups on the chitosan backbone have a pKa value of ~6.5. At low pH below the pKa, the amino groups will be protonated and positively charged. This leads to electrostatic repulsion between chitosan chains and dissolution. Upon increasing the pH to neutral, the amino groups will deprotonate and lose their positive charge. This allows interactions between chitosan chains, leading to physical crosslinking and hydrogel formation.
2. Chitosan is a natural biopolymer derived from chitin that has been deacetylated. It is composed of beta-1,4-linked D-glucosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.
3. A chitosan hydrogel can be prepared by solubilizing chitosan powder in an acidic aqueous medium. The amino groups on the chitosan chains will be protonated in the acidic solution, leading to dissolution and formation of a chitosan solution. Gelation then occurs upon neutralization of the chitosan solution.
4. The properties of a chitosan hydrogel depend on factors like chitosan molecular weight, degree of deacetylation, concentration, solvent pH, ionic strength, drying method, and presence of crosslinking agents.

[Context] Here we use a model that employs an intermediate level of resolution, in order to probe the physical relationship between mRNA–tRNA movement and 30S head motions during the second step of translocation (30S translocation). Specifically, we apply molecular dynamics simulations with an all-atom structure-based model, and identify the roles of tRNA/ribosome sterics and flexibility during this large-scale rearrangement. In this model, the unrotated conformation of the ribosome corresponds to the potential energy minimum. In addition, each tRNA molecule has affinity for two adjacent binding sites on the ribosome, where classical tRNA binding conformations are potential energy minima. With this model, we simulated 250 translocation events, which provide a description of sterically accessible pathways and intermediate ensembles between the A/P–P/E and P/P–E/E ensembles. While the potential energy minima are defined entirely by the unrotated, classical conformations of the ribosome and tRNA, these simulations capture the known chimeric ap/P–pe/E intermediate, where the 30S head is highly rotated. This head-rotated intermediate is in excellent agreement with numerous structures of the ribosome trapped in mid-translocational conformations. Our simulations also predict the presence of a previously unreported intermediate ensemble that is characterized by a distinct tilt of the 30S head. To identify the structural features that contribute to the head-tilted ensemble, we perform hundreds of additional simulations in which specific residues in the 30S subunit are perturbed. These perturbations may be considered a computational analogue of experimental mutational analysis. Using these perturbed models, we show that the tilt motion of the head is a direct consequence of steric interactions between the ribosome and tRNA. Together, our results demonstrate how a simple energetic model can be used to partition the contributors to dynamics, thereby revealing how molecular structure gives rise to biological function.
[Question] How did the researchers identify the structural features that contribute to the head-tilted ensemble observed in the simulations?
Choices:
1. In the model used in this study, the potential energy minima are defined entirely by the unrotated, classical conformations of the ribosome and tRNA.

[Context] Liphatic hydrocarbons are normally robust organic matter preserved in sediments and serve as good proxies of many biogeochemical processes. For example, the alkane ratio C31/C17 is a typical organic geochemical proxy for terrestrial and aquatic input to lakes and estuarine areas. The n-alkane C17 dominates the hydrocarbon compositions of aquatic algae and photosynthetic bacteria and its concentrations are reflective of aquatic palaeoproductivity rates. Vascular land plants, however, contain large proportions of C27, C29 and C31 n-alkanes in their epicuticular waxy coatings. The relative concentration of C31 and C17 in a sediment core therefore reflects the relative input from terrestrial and aquatic sources. Considering that floods, especially extreme floods, carry large amounts of terrestrial materials into estuaries and adjacent environments, we hypothesized that the C31/C17 ratio might be useful as an indicator of palaeofloods.
[Question] Why might the C31/C17 alkane ratio be a useful indicator of paleofloods?
Choices:
1. Aquatic environments dominated by algal/bacterial productivity and with little terrestrial input would be expected to have low C31/C17 ratios. The aquatic algae and bacteria produce mainly the short-chain alkane C17, while land plant-derived long-chain alkanes like C31 are minimal. Lakes located in areas with sparse vegetation or isolated from terrestrial sources could have persistently low C31/C17 ratios.
2. Liphatic hydrocarbons are robust organic matter that are normally preserved in sediments. They serve as good proxies of many biogeochemical processes because their composition provides information about the sources of organic matter deposited in the sediments.
3. Floods, especially large floods, carry substantial amounts of terrestrial organic matter into estuaries and adjacent environments. This terrestrial input is reflected in the sediment composition by a higher proportion of long-chain n-alkanes like C31 that originate from land plants. Therefore, a spike in the C31/C17 ratio in a sediment core may indicate deposition of terrestrial matter by a paleoflood event.
4. The alkane ratio C31/C17 is a typical organic geochemical proxy that indicates the relative inputs of terrestrial and aquatic organic matter in lake and estuarine sediments. The n-alkane C17 originates mainly from aquatic algae and bacteria and reflects aquatic productivity. The n-alkanes C27, C29, and C31 originate mainly from vascular land plants and reflect terrestrial input. A higher C31/C17 ratio indicates more terrestrial versus aquatic input.

The periodic multi-layered structure of the absorber enables to achieve high EM-wave absorption and at the same time high mechanical strength, with a total GNP content which is limited to 1 or 2%wt.

[Context] In this study, we show that PopZ phase separation underlies microdomain formation. By studying the molecular logic of this scaffold protein, we found that its emergent material properties are dictated by the sum of attractive and repulsive forces, mediated by an intrinsically disordered and a helical oligomerization domain, respectively. This framework allowed us to scan the spectrum of material properties with rationally designed PopZ mutants by tuning these attractive and repulsive forces. We identified a region of PopZ material properties that allow for optimal growth, therefore providing a unique case study on how selective pressures have tuned condensate features to maximize biological fitness. Lastly, we use our insights into the modular nature of the PopZ scaffold to create a condensation module for the generation of tunable condensates in eukaryote systems.

[Context] Following the discovery of graphene, interest in its superb properties has sparked a great deal of pure and applied research on graphene and graphene-based materials. Among the graphene-based materials, graphene oxide (GO) is considered an outstanding candidate for a precursor in the preparation of graphene devices since reduced GO has similar properties to graphene. GO is composed of a mixture of two different types of regions. oxidized non-graphitic regions and non-reacted graphitic regions. The co-existence of these regions produces new properties such as tunable excitons. The chemical vulnerability of epoxy groups in GO leads to an increase in the fraction of non-graphitic regions during reaction with NaOH, which destroys most epoxy groups in GO. GO disperses well in dilute NaOH solutions, where the GO layers are exfoliated. Lengthy immersion in a NaOH solution followed by vacuum drying produces graphene hydroxide (GH), which exhibits exotic properties such as a positive temperature coefficient of resistance and a large electron–acoustic phonon coupling constant. In addition, half of the carbon atoms in GH have sp-hybridized orbitals in a layered structure, which is different from typical graphene-based compounds. A high ratio of sp. sp carbon atoms and other structural features, including chemical groups on its surface, give GH a great deal of surface area. this not only enhances its chemical reactivity but also opens up the opportunity for applications in electrodes for supercapacitors and sensors. Therefore, research on the structure of GH would shed light on certain aspects of graphene systems with chemical groups, as well as help realize high–gravimetric-capacitance electrodes for energy storage systems. Here, we report on our investigation of the structure of GH, which is significantly different from that of GO. We found that the 3D structure of GH gives it unique properties.

[Context] The overarching goal of the current study was to address these important gaps in the literature by probing the acute and sustained affective and neural responses to naturalistic positive mood induction, as well as their spontaneous fluctuations during subsequent resting states. To achieve this goal, we developed a novel task involving humour processing and delivery of self-referential positive feedback (). During an acute phase, mood was induced naturalistically and implicitly (that is, with participants unaware of the purpose of the manipulation) by providing participants positive social feedback related to their task performance, which is a potent elicitor of positive affective state. The sustained effect of the manipulation was assessed half an hour later, while participants completed a similar task devoid of any feedback. In addition, spontaneous affective and neural fluctuations in the absence of external stimuli were investigated by means of three resting-state scans that were acquired before the acute phase (rest 1), following the acute phase (rest 2) and following the sustained phase (rest 3.). These successive rest and activation runs were interspersed with six mood ratings (). Finally, causal interactions between acute neural response to positive mood induction and DMN resting-state connectivity patterns were investigated using spectral dynamic causal modelling spectral-DCM method for resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Given the potency of social feedback and the established role of VS in mediating the acute responses to pleasurable stimuli, we hypothesized that the delivery of positive social feedback would yield substantial increase in positive mood, which in turn would be associated with VS activation. Furthermore, we expected that neural interactions between VS and DMN during subsequent rest would be linked to sustained positive mood following the offset of the positive stimuli.
[Question] What analysis method did the researchers use to investigate causal interactions between acute neural response and resting state connectivity?

[Context] The unique properties of natural supramolecular protein assemblies has inspired scientists to create (semi-)synthetic systems that capture characteristic features of their natural counterparts, including (supramolecular) polymers, vesicles, and DNA-origami structures.For example, synthetic vesicles have been used to encapsulate or reversibly recruit proteins and their substrates to increase their local concentrations, providing control over reaction specificity and kinetics.One-dimensional templates consisting of covalent copolymers of styrene sulfonate and methyl methacrylate with poly(ethylene glycol) side chains have been used as heparin mimics by decorating them with basic fibroblast growth factors, hereby significantly increasing the stability of the growth factor while applying therapeutically relevant forms of stress.More recently, Stupp and coworkers reported the development of sulfated glycopeptide nanostructures as highly active, adaptive scaffolds for the binding of various growth factor proteins, efficiently promoting bone regeneration in the spine.Another noticeable example is the work of Brunsveld and coworkers, who explored the use of supramolecular polymers consisting of amphiphilic discotics to control the assembly of fluorescent proteins, using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study the dynamic exchange of protein functionalized monomers between different polymer chains.Synthetic platforms based on DNA origami enable excellent control over the spatial orientation and stoichiometry of the recruited proteins, allowing the assembly of protein cascades with increased pathway specificity and turnover rates.While the attachment of protein-DNA conjugates on DNA-origami scaffolds is in principle reversible through DNA strand exchange, the origami scaffold itself is highly static, hampering the dynamic rearrangement of recruited proteins to, e.g., accommodate mismatches in receptor distances and assembly defects.Systems that combine the programmability of DNA hybridization with the self-assembly properties of synthetic polymers have received increased attention, but primarily with the aim of developing materials with tunable properties.

To make it compatible with the MEW process, modifications in the setup of the FDM 3D printer are carried out. Use of a conventional FDM 3D printer as an MEW device is one of the novelties of this study. Also, fabrication of the composite PLA/PCL scaffold using MEW process is done for the first time. All scaffolds are made of 10 layers of microfibers placed in the box structure of the scaffold. The composite PLA/PCL scaffold has an alternating pattern in which PLA and PCL microfibers are laid in consecutive layers. Multi-material scaffolds made using traditional techniques like electrospinning or solvent casting/particulate leaching suffer from random distribution of different materials. This is a serious drawback which makes the behavior of the cells cultured on the scaffold unpredictable. MEW with the described operating mechanism resolves this issue and helps fabricating a more tissue-like structure.

[Context] The Wnt signaling pathway plays key roles in cell fate determination during embryonic development, neurogenesis, homeostasis, and oncogenesis. In the canonical pathway, the Wnt-receptor complex controls the stability of a key effector β-catenin by regulating the activity of a cytoplasmic β-catenin destruction complex.

[Context] The role of muscle in ALS has been extensively studied and gave rise to highly inconsistent results. On the one hand, the data from the last decade shows that the causes of neurodegeneration in ALS should be sought outside the nervous system. For example, overexpression of SOD1 in skeletal muscle initiates motoneurons death and causes profound muscle atrophy. Additional support for this view is provided by the observations that the destruction of neuromuscular junctions has been linked to oxidative stress induced by a tissue-specific breakdown of muscle mitochondria. Nevertheless, on the other hand, no evidence targeting muscle to boost its volume/function provides compelling, lasting, or meaningful protective effects against motoneurons degeneration and clinical motor deficits in rodent models or even patients.
[Question] What other observation provides support for causes of ALS being outside the nervous system?
[Answer] ",The observation that destruction of neuromuscular junctions has been linked to oxidative stress induced by tissue-specific breakdown of muscle mitochondria provides additional support for this view.," There are several other observations that provide support for the idea that the causes of ALS are outside the nervous system.

[Context] Theoretically, if an additive is much more liable towards reduction than other electrolyte components to form an interfacial environment favorable for Li deposition, good electrochemical performance can be achieved regardless of the electrolyte systems (“electrolyte-agnostic” additive). Herein, we report the discovery of the pronounced effect of nitrate anions (NO3) on the morphology and reversibility of Li deposition in carbonate-based electrolytes. Although nitrate additive is not unfamiliar to the community, as LiNO3 is regularly used in ethers for Li-sulfur batteries, it remains being unexplored in carbonates partially due to its extremely low solubility. However, we observe that the preferential reduction of NO3 during SEI formation in carbonates, albeit at very low concentration, could substantially alter the interfacial chemistry, resulting in spherical Li nuclei (instead of dendritic) and greatly improved CE exceeding the values in ethers. To further overcome the solubility limitation, a solubility-mediated sustained-release concept is proposed, where LiNO3 nanoparticles are dispersed in porous polymer backbone on anode surface and can be steadily dissolved during battery operation when soluble LiNO3 is consumed. With the maintained concentration of NO3 on Li surface frontier, the anode CE can exceed 98% for over 200 cycles, and the cycle life of full-cells paired with LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (NMC) is more than quadrupled, which is appreciable in corrosive carbonate electrolytes. Note that during the peer-review process of our manuscript, we noticed another work utilizing a slightly similar engineering method to overcome the solubility barrier of LiNO3 in carbonate electrolyte, which also resulted in improved Li anode CE. Nevertheless, we are confident that our comprehensive work brings a significant amount of new knowledge complementary to the other study. Particularly, the mechanism of NO3 in modifying the SEI properties is studied deliberately on the basis of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), ultramicroelectrode, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
[Question] How did the authors try to overcome the solubility limitation of nitrate additives like LiNO3 in carbonate electrolytes?
[Answer] ","To overcome the low solubility of LiNO3 in carbonates, the authors proposed a ""solubility-mediated sustained-release concept.""

[Context] However, the advantages of using VR technology to study spatial cognition are only relevant if the processes involved in virtual navigation are similar enough to those used in real navigation that accurate inferences about spatial behavior can be drawn. Research has largely supported the effectiveness of VR in recreating the actual spatial experience, even when the VR environment is relatively non-immersive, as is the case when it is presented on a desktop display. With the increasing availability and decreasing price point of head-mounted displays (HMD), immersive VR technology allows for physical sensations such as head movement and, when paired with external devices, locomotion. HMDs are portable and lightweight, and allow participants to obtain a greater sense of presence than desktop simulations can typically provide. Overall, the use of VR as a practical method for studying spatial cognition has yielded reliable experimental results and will undoubtedly continue for the foreseeable future, especially given the continual refinement and growing accessibility of VR systems.

[Context] Here, we investigate an all-inkjet printed inverter working as an element in NOT logic gates in the unipolar configuration, with one transistor and one resistor in the structure. To produce paths and electrodes the commercially available silver ink was used. New ink formulas based on semiconductor and dielectric materials were elaborated in the laboratory. The ink compositions were optimized to simplify the printing process. Organic thin film transistors were printed in the bottom gate bottom contacts (BGBC) architecture, with poly (4-vinylphenol) as the gate dielectric and poly[2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno [3,2-b]thiophene)] (DPPDTT) as a semiconductor. Photoxidized poly (3-hexyltiophene) (P3HT) was used as an active layer in the resistors. Photooxidation causes the transistors with poly (3-hexylthiophene) layers to lose their properties, so they are no longer sensitive to the electric field formed in the dielectric layer by the gate voltage. The devices made with this photo-oxidized material showed ohmic current–voltage characteristics. The polymer could therefore be used as a resistor. Resistors were printed in the same way as the transistors, but without a gate electrode. To obtain a working inverter, the transistors and resistors were developed separately. The printing parameters i. e., the area of printed semiconductor layer, the thickness of the dielectric film, the dimensions of the transistor channel, etc. were optimized. On the basis of the DC current–voltage characteristics of the separately printed resistor and transistor, we prepared a model of the reference inverter. Graphical analysis of their operation was then performed. The parameters of the resistor and transistor were chosen to produce fully printed inverters with the best properties. The fully printable inverters were tested and analyzed to evaluate their performance.

[Context] Our current understanding of past climate fluctuations is largely derived from instrumental time series, numerical climate models (for example, see ref.) and robustly dated well-calibrated proxy archives (for example, dendrochronologies, ice cores, corals and speleothems) at high frequencies (inter-annual) and ocean sediment archives at lower resolutions (multi-decadal to centennial). These records have highlighted the inherent complexities in the ocean–atmosphere system with TSI and volcanic aerosols acting as top–down forcings driving ocean and atmosphere variability, coupled with internal variability and feedback mechanisms within the ocean acting as bottom-up drivers modulating the atmospheric climate response. However, the interaction between ocean dynamics (such as sea surface temperature (SST), seawater density, surface circulation and overturning circulation strength) and atmospheric variability remain poorly characterized. The difficulty in constraining the role of coupled ocean–atmosphere mechanisms in climate variability to a large extent results from the limited length of oceanographic instrumental time series and the low temporal resolution and dating uncertainties associated with marine sediment archives. These issues hinder the identification of causal relationships through for example lead–lag analysis. Despite these challenges, evidence derived from marine proxy records has indicated that there were broad scale changes in the North Atlantic dynamics over the last millennium. For example, during the MCA-LIA transition, analyses of foraminifera from the Straits of Florida indicate the strength of the Gulf Stream and associated heat transport reduced by ca.10% (ref.). Similarly, regional marine radiocarbon reservoir (ΔR) determinations from long-lived bivalves suggest an increase in the proportion of Arctic water entrained onto the North Icelandic shelf at this time and reconstructions derived from coralline algae and sedimentary biomarker records suggest a synchronous increase in Arctic and Icelandic sea-ice extent.

2. The path length can be increased using a multipass gas cell or an optical cavity. A multipass cell uses mirrors to reflect the light multiple times through the gas sample. An optical cavity increases the path length by enclosing the gas sample between highly reflective mirrors.
3. In DCS, a high-bandwidth photodetector is used to measure the transmission of the two combs through the gas sample. The absorption features of the gas sample will be encoded in the transmission spectrum.

[Context] To achieve this comparison, experimental benchmarks for charge-localized and charge-delocalized states are required. This is challenging because in most cases electronic systems exhibit just one particular charge distribution, making comparison between states with different charge distributions difficult. In a recent study, however, we have found that in N,N’-dimethylpiperazine (DMP), both a charge-localized state and a charge-delocalized state can be observed. DMP has previously served as a prototype for exploring electron lone pair interactions and CT between nitrogen atoms. In its cationic state, the positive charge can be localized on one of the nitrogen atoms (DMP-L), or delocalized over the two equivalent nitrogen atoms (DMP-D). The charge-localized ion DMP-L, however, has not been observed until the recent ultrafast time-resolved experiment. It is possible to identify the different charge states because they have distinct spectral and temporal signatures. Upon optical excitation, the charge-localized state is initially generated. A subsequent CT then leads to the charge-delocalized state. This discovery of two states with distinct charge distributions has now laid the foundation for an experimental approach for measuring their relative energy. The approach is based on photoionization from Rydberg states, whose binding energies have been found to be remarkably dependent on the nuclear arrangements and the charge distribution of the molecular ion core. Further, the Rydberg electron-binding energy is independent of a molecule’s internal energy, making it ideally suited for the exploration of high-energy charge states that are populated when the molecules are highly energized. Because the Rydberg electron has a small effect on the bonding and molecular structure, the configuration of the molecular ion cores of Rydberg states closely resemble those of the cationic states. The binding energies of the Rydberg states, therefore, yield information about the charge-localized and charge-delocalized cationic states.
[Question] How can the different charge states of DMP be identified?
Choices:
1. In most electronic systems, only one particular charge distribution is exhibited, making direct comparison between states with different charge distributions difficult.
2. The charge-localized ion DMP-L and charge-delocalized DMP-D have distinct spectral and temporal signatures, allowing them to be distinguished. Upon optical excitation, the charge-localized state is initially generated, followed by charge transfer to the charge-delocalized state.
3. Rydberg electron binding energies are independent of a molecule's internal energy. This makes Rydberg states ideally suited for exploring high-energy charge states populated when molecules are highly energized.

However, the emergence of non-VT pneumococcal disease worldwide and the more modest impact of PCV on colonisation in high transmission settings, threaten this success. Control of pneumococcal URT colonisation in humans is not fully understood, and so defining the mechanistic basis for host control of pneumococcal colonisation at the mucosal surface is therefore crucial for the further optimisation of therapeutic interventions which target carriage and transmission. The process of transmission is not fully understood, but mucosal inflammation, potentially enhanced by co-infection with viruses such as Influenza A, has been proposed to mediate bacterial shedding from the nasopharynx.
[Question] What has been the effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in Europe and North America?
Choices:
1. The text proposes that mucosal inflammation, potentially enhanced by co-infection with viruses such as Influenza A, has been proposed to mediate bacterial shedding from the nasopharynx. This means that inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and throat, possibly made worse by concurrent infection with the influenza A virus, may cause increased release of pneumococcus from the nasopharynx.
2. The text mentions two threats that endanger the success of the PCV. First, the emergence of non-vaccine serotype (non-VT) pneumococcal disease worldwide. This refers to increases in infections caused by pneumococcal strains not covered by the vaccine. Second, the more modest impact of PCV on colonization in high transmission settings. This means the vaccine has been less effective at preventing carriage of pneumococcus in environments where spread is common.
3. The text states that in Europe and North America, there has been a dramatic effect of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) on vaccine serotype (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumococcal carriage, and transmission. This means that the introduction of the PCV has led to significant reductions in infections, colonization, and spread of pneumococcal strains that are included in the vaccine.
4. The text states that control of pneumococcal upper respiratory tract (URT) colonization in humans is not fully understood. It further says that defining the mechanistic basis for host control of pneumococcal colonisation at the mucosal surface is crucial for further optimizing therapeutic interventions which target carriage and transmission. In other words, a better comprehension of how humans inhibit pneumococcal colonization in the nose/throat could allow for improvements in treatments and preventives that aim to reduce carriage and spread of pneumococcus.

[Context] Here, we introduce a conceptual advancement in the development of ligands for CAN, that is, meta-linked diphenanthroline compounds as electron-transport ligands (ET ligands). These ligands were found to feasibly form tetrahedrally coordinated double-helical metal complexes during the co-evaporation process, effectively lowering the IE of air-stable metals to achieve improved electron injection. Benefiting from the high charge transport ability of ligands, efficient electron injection independent of the thickness of the EILs and the dopant concentration over a large range was realized. By considering the chelating dynamics, a meta-linked diphenanthroline ligand (m-dPhen) with a reduced steric effect was elaborately developed, achieving better charge injection than the commonly used lithium fluoride (LiF) and 8-hydroxyquinolinato lithium (Liq) as well as a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.3% for deep-blue devices based on triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA), which is among the highest EQE values for TTA-driven OLEDs with y color coordinates below 0.1. Moreover, the device performance of the deep-blue OLED with a Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.139 and 0.045) satisfying the requirement of BT.2020 is further improved by implementing m-dPhen as the EIL, thus resulting in a high current efficiency calibrated by the y color coordinate of 237 cd A at 1000 cd m and a superlong LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 104.1 h at an initial luminance of 5000 cd m. This performance is better than that achieved with commercial EILs of ytterbium (Yb), thus validating the potential of CAN as an alternative n-doping technique applicable for efficient optoelectronics.

Interestingly in the above cascade of LC phases, no smectic ordering has been observed—notably absent is the most common smectic mesophase, the smectic-A (Sm-A) phase, in which two-dimensional (2D), fluid layers of molecules are stacked along the third dimension, which is also the axis (termed director) of orientational (nematic) order.

[Context] Diameter growth of aneurysms has been described as discontinuous, erratic and nonlinear. The inter-observer variability of maximal aneurysm diameter (Dmax) measurements, between both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography are significant. Even for a CT of a single patient with an AAA, many ways of measuring the maximal aneurysm diameter have been described. The fastest diameter growth in an AAA does not always occur at the Dmax location, and it has been suggested that volume growth is a more sensitive marker of aneurysm disease progression. Semi-automatic measurements, where a diameter is computationally measured from a segmented aneurysm may be more accurate compared to manual diameter readings, and may contribute to improved growth prediction of AAAs.
[Question] What are some characteristics of aneurysm diameter growth that have been described in the literature?
Choices:
1. No, the text states that the fastest diameter growth in an aneurysm does not always occur at the location of maximal diameter. This means the region with the largest diameter measurement may not correspond to the region that is expanding most rapidly.
2. The text states that diameter growth of aneurysms has been described as discontinuous, erratic, and nonlinear. This suggests that aneurysm diameter does not necessarily grow at a steady, predictable rate over time. Instead, growth may happen sporadically in an unpredictable manner.
3. The text notes two key challenges. First, there is significant inter-observer variability in diameter measurements, meaning different observers may report different diameter measurements for the same aneurysm based on CT or ultrasound imaging. Second, even for a single CT scan of one patient's aneurysm, many different ways of measuring the maximal diameter have been described. This suggests inconsistency across techniques and observers.
4. The text suggests that volume growth may be a more sensitive marker of aneurysm disease progression than diameter growth. Since aneurysms can expand asymmetrically, volume provides a more comprehensive measure of total expansion over time compared to any single diameter measurement.

[Context] In some of these systems, structural colours can also be observed, as for example in Pollia condensata pixelated fruit. Structural colour arises from the selective reflection of incident light when it interacts with micro- or nano-scale structures periodic on the length scale of the wavelength of visible light. However, it is in the animal kingdom that more research has been performed related to this type of coloration and its development. One of the many examples of structural colours is the patterns observed in the feathers of some birds, as in the peacock, whose eyespots consist of a sequence of concentric iridescent variable coloured circles that changes in time as the animal ages. The formation and evolution of some of these patterns were attributed to the existence of reaction-diffusion mechanisms initially addressed by Turing in 1952. Structural colouration is well-documented in cellulosic cholesteric structures but travelling colour patterns have not previously been investigated.
[Question] How do the colors in peacock feathers change over time?
Choices:
1. Structural colouration is commonly observed in the animal kingdom, particularly in the feathers of certain birds like peacocks. The eyespots on peacock feathers consist of concentric iridescent circles that change color over the bird's lifetime.
2. Structural colouration arises from the selective reflection of incident light when it interacts with micro- or nano-scale structures periodic on the length scale of the wavelength of visible light. It is caused by the physical structure of the material rather than pigments.
3. As a peacock ages, melanin is gradually deposited in the feather barbules. This increases the periodicity of the nanostructures, changing the wavelength of light constructively interfered and producing a shift in color over the lifetime of the feather. The eyespots start with a blue-green color and shift to more yellow-green tones.

[Context] In this work a new experimental technique has been developed for subjecting 2-dimensional crystals (such as graphene, MoS2, etc.) to controllable equibiaxial tensile strain gradients. The principle of this technique is based on the extension along two dimensions of the three-point bending configuration of plastic bars that have been employed for uniaxial loading as mentioned earlier. The added advantage of this approach is the fact that due to the symmetry of the loading procedure the term referring to the shear deformation potential (SDP) becomes zero and therefore the Poisson’s ratio of the underlying substrate has no effect on the measured strain. To accomplish this, a plastic substrate with cruciform shape, as shown in , is symmetrically deformed about its centre, thus inducing an equi-biaxial strain at that position. The advantages of this technique compared to those attempted earlier are the following.(a) the biaxial strain is applied at a stepwise and controllable manner, (b) the strain can be directly measured using strain gauges, (c) the setup is capable of loading any 2-dimensional material at moderate strain levels and, finally, (d) the jig is housed under a Raman microscope that allows mapping of stress or strain with submicron resolution. Effectively, this means that the present method carries all the advantages and simplicity of the corresponding uniaxial technique, which has been successfully applied in a number of uniaxial strain studies on nanoscale materials such as graphene. Furthermore, by employing electrical resistance strain gauges and by monitoring the shifts of the 2D and G Raman lines, information on the stress transfer efficiency upon application of equi-biaxial strain can easily be obtained, for simply supported as well as fully embedded graphene in polymer matrices.

[Context] The interaction of the two 2D electron systems results in a strong modification of the spectra with respect to the constituents (). In the upper part of the gap, at large k|| the Rashba state of BiTeCl preserves its original shape, while at both inner and outer branches of the Rashba state rapidly become strongly hybridized with graphene cone states. Already at k|| ≈ 0.05 Å they start to turn into the grephene-derived states completely localized within the graphene layer and dispersing towards the Dirac point immersed in the conduction band of the substrate bulk states. In the lower part of the gap, approaching the point two of four graphene bands start to hybridize with the substrate surface state forming a hole-like Rashba state near the valence band, which is completely localized within substrate uppermost layers in the vicinity of the point. Thus, at small k|| the hybridization of two of four graphene branches with the Rashba state of the BiTeCl substrate leads to a break of both branches of the Rashba state in such a way that its degeneracy point appears near the valence band or, to the contrary, the Rashba states break two graphene bands.

As a result of these changes, in the middle part of the bulk band gap, within the energy interval of 70 meV (see yellow stripe in ), two almost degenerate Dirac states of graphene survive. The small SOI-induced k||-splitting for the Dirac cones is less then 0.002 Å.
[Question] What happens when the 2D electron systems of graphene and BiTeCl interact?
Choices:
1. In the middle of the bulk band gap, within an energy interval of 70 meV, two almost degenerate Dirac states originating from graphene survive. The small spin-orbit induced k||-splitting for the graphene Dirac cones is less than 0.002 Å.
2. Near the Γ point, two of the four graphene bands start to hybridize with the BiTeCl surface state, forming a hole-like Rashba state near the valence band. This Rashba state becomes completely localized within the BiTeCl substrate uppermost layers near Γ. The hybridization leads to a break in both branches of the Rashba state, so its degeneracy point appears near the valence band. Alternatively, the Rashba states break the two graphene bands.
3. The interaction results in a strong modification of the spectra compared to the individual materials. The Rashba state of BiTeCl largely preserves its original shape at high k|| values in the upper part of the bandgap. At lower k||, the inner and outer branches of the BiTeCl Rashba state become strongly hybridized with the graphene cone states. The BiTeCl Rashba states start to turn into graphene-derived states localized in the graphene layer that disperse towards the Dirac point in the conduction band.

[Context] Improving operating voltage of MAPbI3 has been achieved by substitution of I with Br, which arises from low activation barrier of Br vacancy. In this study, we evaluate CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx as a component in nonvolatile memory devices. We also quantified how Br incorporation affects the electrical properties of different compositions of CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3). The fabricated Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx/ITO memory device shows low voltage operation, long data retention, and good endurance. Based on measured current electric field responses, we propose possible resistive switching mechanisms that involve migration of Br and I vacancies. We demonstrated first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to clarify the lower ionic migration barrier for bromide vacancy than for iodine vacancy which leads to decreased electric field as Br content increases. Based on our present results, it is promising that the ReRAM property with CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx can be improved by controlling the Br contents.
[Question] What were the effects observed by incorporating Br into MAPbI3?
Choices:
1. The results indicate that the ReRAM property of MAPbI3-xBrx can be improved by controlling the Br content. Increasing Br content decreases the electric field.
2. Incorporating Br into MAPbI3 was found to affect the electrical properties. Specifically, adding Br led to low voltage operation, long data retention, and good endurance in the Au/CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx/ITO memory devices fabricated.
3. The first-principles DFT calculations clarified that the ionic migration barrier is lower for bromide vacancy compared to iodine vacancy. This leads to decreased electric field as Br content increases.

[Context] However, tuning of the Fermi levels by the electric field is insufficient to change the band offset, which affects the performance of a heterojunction significantly.Besides, a sustained external voltage to maintain the optimal performance of the device causes considerable power consumption.Ferroelectrics provide a non-volatile remanent polarization electric field over 1 V/nm, which is large enough to modify the bandgap of semiconductors according to the Stark effect.Ferroelectric field-effect transistors based on ferroelectrics and 2D materials have been demonstrated high performances and great potentials in electronics and optoelectronics.Predictably, combining ferroelectrics with VHJs achieves highly tunable band structures and tailored optoelectronic properties.Here, we designed a ferroelectric VHJ (Fe-VHJ) consisting of a ferroelectric polymer, P(VDF-TrFE), and GeSe/MoS2 VHJ.Under modulation of the ferroelectric polarization field, the electrical characteristics of the GeSe/MoS2 pn junction can be tuned and its output can be maintained at two specific states.The band alignment between GeSe and MoS2 can be switched from type II (staggered) to type I (straddling) by reversing the direction of ferroelectric polarization field.With ferroelectric-tuned VHJ band engineering, the GeSe/MoS2 junction can act as a high-performance photodetector.High responsivities are achieved for a wide range of wavelengths spanning from visible to near-infrared.The anisotropy of GeSe is employed to demonstrate a polarized light-sensitive photodetector, which is further enhanced by the ferroelectric field.More importantly, the ferroelectric field is applied on the VHJ to engineer the band alignment type, broaden the detection wavelength range, and enrich functionalities..

Several cytokines and chemokines including tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) are present in the brains, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of PD patients. Several studies show that extracellular monomeric, oligomeric and aggregated α-syn induces a pro-inflammatory response in rodent microglia through the release of cytokines increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) as well as the production of free radicals. Brain pericytes surround endothelial cells of brain capillaries forming the neurovascular unit where they maintain the integrity of the blood–brain barrier and the control of blood flow. Pericytes also have the ability to transfer the α-syn protein to other pericytes in vitro. Importantly, pericytes are one of the first brain resident cells to respond to systemic inflammation and can be activated by monomeric α-syn in rat pericytes in vitro and in a mouse model overexpressing human α-syn.

[Context] A crucial step in using NMR to measure unfolding is the selection of suitable resonances. The main problems are linked to the nature of the resonances and to their position inside the protein. A common practice is to use the amide groups in N-labelled samples. In principle, all NH resonances could be used to monitor the unfolding process but in practice there are several limitations. Amide protons, also when only partially exposed to water, undergo exchange with the water and this may influence the results in several ways. The second problem, i. e., the position of the NH group with respect to the protein surface, is only partially related to proton exchange. Even more important is the relationship with the mechanism of unfolding. When monitoring unfolding of a well structure single domain protein with other spectroscopic techniques, e. g., CD spectroscopy, one observes intensity changes related to the whole secondary structure elements (helices and/or beta sheets) whereas the changes of NMR volumes reflect changes of single atoms and indirectly their location on the protein. The position of the atom in the protein architecture may reflect cooperative unfolding only if the atom is well inside the hydrophobic core. On the contrary, if the atom is positioned on external structural elements, volume changes may reflect peripheral motions.
[Question] What are some of the main problems with using amide groups from N-labelled samples to monitor unfolding by NMR?
Choices:
1. The position is important because it relates to the mechanism of unfolding. NH groups in the hydrophobic core reflect cooperative unfolding across secondary structure elements like helices and sheets. But NH groups on the surface may just show local peripheral motions, not cooperative unfolding.
2. CD sees intensity changes related to entire secondary structure elements like helices and sheets. But NMR sees volume changes of individual atoms, so it reflects the location of those atoms in the protein structure. Only atoms in the hydrophobic core reflect cooperative unfolding.
3. The main problems are linked to the nature of the amide resonances and their position inside the protein. First, amide protons can undergo exchange with water even when only partially exposed, which can influence the results. Second, the position of the NH group with respect to the protein surface is important, beyond just proton exchange. NH groups on the surface may reflect peripheral motions rather than cooperative unfolding.
4. According to the text, ideal NH groups to monitor are those well inside the hydrophobic core of the protein. These will reflect cooperative unfolding across the protein structure. Surface NH groups may just show local peripheral motions.

[Context] S-nitrosylation, the addition of an NO moiety to a protein cysteine (Cys) thiol to form an S-nitrosothiol, has emerged as a key mechanism for the transfer of NO bioactivity. However, only rare, highly reactive, solvent exposed Cys thiols, often embedded within an SNO motif, are potential sites for this redox-based, post-translational modification. SNO formation at target Cys thiols can regulate protein function acting akin to other more established molecular switches such as phosphorylation. The total cellular level of S-nitrosylation is controlled indirectly by the action of the enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which turns over the natural NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). This enzyme is required for plant development in addition to biotic and abiotic responses. Significantly, recent evidence implies that GSNO and NO may have separable and overlapping functions integral to redox regulation, implying distinct reactive nitrogen species (RNS) may have discreet biological activities.

Rachke et al. observed that FNDC5 sequence is found in most rodents and primates, and is conserved throughout the species. However, in human FNDC5 sequence, the translational start codon ATG is not conserved and instead ATA, which codes for isoleucine, is found. Rachke et al. also reported that upregulation of PGC1-α mRNA expression by simulating contraction of primary human myotubes did not show a concomitant increase in the FNDC5 mRNA expression. Furthermore, Rachke et al. failed to observe an increase in FNDC5 mRNA in either endurance or strength training (resistance exercise). Hence, they concluded that irisin may not confer its beneficial effects in humans.

Though the precise mechanism of the afterglow in these materials remains ambiguous, it is generally accepted that impurity is responsible and three steps may be involved.(1) excitation of the guest species (impurity), (2) trapping of the excited electrons by defects in host lattices, (3) slow charge recombination of the trapped electrons by thermal energy. Mimicking this guest/host architecture of minerals, purely organic afterglow lasting for more than one hour has been realized recently via doping one electron-donating guest in an electron-withdrawing host.

[Context] In addition, the stimulus parameters for optimizing the PhNR for the characterization of RGC dysfunction have been studied. Sustar showed that the PhNR elicited with a chromatic stimulus was better at discriminating between glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous eyes than an achromatic stimulus. Hara reported that the correlations between the PhNR1 and the mean deviation were stronger for the achromatic stimulus but the converse was true for the PhNR2, where the correlations were stronger for the achromatic stimulus. It is likely that these observations relate to the changes in the i-wave between the ERGs elicited by chromatic and achromatic stimuli, which they reported as occurring earlier later in the achromatic compared to chromatic stimulus, and thus had less of an impact on the PhNR I amplitude. Nonetheless, they reported that the PhNR II of the chromatic stimulus performed the best at discriminating between eyes with and without glaucoma. However, neither of these two studies have compared the utility of these three parameters—the PhNR1, i-wave and PhNR2—when used in combination (rather than in isolation) between the chromatic and achromatic stimuli. It is plausible that the utility of the achromatic stimulus may improve when these three parameters are considered in combination, due to its ability to more clearly demarcate the PhNR1 and i-wave.
[Question] Why might the chromatic and achromatic stimuli show differences in correlations between the PhNR parameters and glaucoma?
[Answer] ","Hara et al. reported that the i-wave occurred earlier for the achromatic stimulus compared to the chromatic stimulus.

In contrast, for the chromatic stimulus the later i-wave overlaps less with PhNR1."," The differences in correlations between the PhNR parameters and glaucoma between the chromatic and achromatic stimuli might be due to the unique neural mechanisms underlying each type of stimulus.

[Context] Processing bottlenecks are effectively avoided by the human visual system, which solves a similar problem of inferring object shapes and locations from photon counts. In part, the human visual system achieves this by adaptively sampling the scene depending on its content, while adjusting to the dynamic range of intensity variations. This adaptive sampling works by selectively focusing the attention of the eyes on areas with potentially high information content. This selective focus then enables the efficient inference of information about the scene at a high effective resolution by directing the processing capacity of the retina and the visual cortex. As in fluorescence microscopy, the information in different areas of a scene is not encoded in absolute intensity differences, but in relative differences compared to the local brightness. The human visual system maintains effective adaptive sampling across up to nine orders of magnitude of brightness by using local gain control mechanisms that adjust to, and account for, changes in the dynamic range of intensity variations. Together, adaptation and local gain control enable the visual system to provide a high rate of information content using as little as 1MB s of data from the retina. In contrast, the information-to-data ratio in pixel representations of fluorescence microscopy images is much lower and is governed by the spatial and temporal resolution of the images rather than by their contents.
[Question] How does the human visual system maintain effective sampling across a wide range of brightness levels?
Choices:
1. The human visual system encodes information in relative intensity differences compared to local brightness, rather than absolute intensities. This, along with adaptive sampling and gain control, enables a high information-to-data ratio. In contrast, fluorescence microscopy images have lower information-to-data ratios governed by their fixed spatial and temporal resolution rather than content.
2. The human visual system maintains effective sampling across up to nine orders of magnitude of brightness by using local gain control mechanisms. These mechanisms adjust to and account for changes in the dynamic range of intensity variations across the visual scene.

[Context] Here we propose and demonstrate a simple lensless hyperspectral PL camera that allows PL imaging by using a single-pixel detector – a spectrometer providing the camera with spectral resolution. Our approach makes it possible to decrease the number of measurements, compared to sample scanning, to about 20% of the image pixel number, while keeping the primary image information. The abovementioned example measurement (128 × 128 pixel, 1s acquisition) can therefore be carried out in about one hour. Moreover, we can achieve the imaging using only two optical elements – a transmissive or reflective diffusor and a beam splitting wedge or any equivalent element. Hence the method can be applied to a broad range of coherent excitation sources and PL detection ranges.

Choices:
1. Computer simulations play a substantial role in accurately solving and interpreting the results of some unknown problems in statistical mechanics, structural issues, and the activity of biomechanical molecules. Simulations provide a tool for solving problems that may not be solvable by other methods or may be difficult or can only be solved approximately.
2. The strength and mechanical properties of nanostructures are important for their potential clinical applications, such as in dental treatments, bone repair, and more. By using MD simulations to reliably study the effects of temperature and pressure on BAG nanostructures, the results can help improve the efficiency of BAG-based treatments.
3. Molecular systems generally involve large numbers of particles, making it impossible to determine their properties analytically. MD simulations can examine the relationships between molecular structure, motion, and function using computational procedures. This allows MD to study molecular systems that cannot be solved analytically.
4. Previous studies had not investigated the influence of initial temperature (250-350 K) and pressure (0-10 bar) on the mechanical behavior of BAG-based nanostructures.

[Context] If aggregation or gelation is studied, the intermolecular interaction is inevitably considered. There are usually two ways to understand such phase behaviors. One is from the view of statistical thermodynamics, the driven force of self-assembly comes from the entropy or enthalpy gain or loss. The other is from microscopic level that assembly behavior is usually associated with the intermolecular interactions. The non-covalent inter- or intra- molecular interactions are usually divided into two groups, one is the Columbic force between ions, the other is van der Waals force between dipoles or induced dipoles, both are modified with temperature and medium. Hydrogen bond is usually considered as a unique van der Waals force, it is an electrostatic dipolar-dipolar attraction, but not a covalent bond as termed. It possesses some features of the covalent bonding, stronger than van der Waals force, and with directional and limited interaction partner. For a long period, it is difficult to distinguish H bonding from the van der Waals forces, including the intrinsic dipolar interaction or the thermally activated induced dipolar interactions. The quantitative description of the dynamics of molecule shall be considered too, because the reversible non-covalent interaction, with the observable characteristic time of 10~10 s and the Arrhenius life time of 40–80 kJ/mol, is much larger than the thermal energy.
[Question] Why was it historically difficult to distinguish hydrogen bonding from other van der Waals forces?
Choices:
1. The two main ways are: 1) From the view of statistical thermodynamics, where the driven force of self-assembly comes from entropy or enthalpy gain or loss. 2) From the microscopic level, where assembly behavior is associated with intermolecular interactions.
2. The two main groups are: 1) Columbic forces between ions. 2) Van der Waals forces between dipoles or induced dipoles.
3. It was difficult because other van der Waals forces include intrinsic dipolar interactions and thermally activated induced dipolar interactions, which have similarities to hydrogen bonding. Quantitative description of molecular dynamics is needed to fully distinguish them.
4. Because they have characteristic times of 10^-10 s and Arrhenius lifetimes of 40-80 kJ/mol, which are much larger than thermal energy. Their reversible nature must be considered dynamically over time.

Precise optimization of operating parameters can also improve edge collection over wall collection.

We find that the SOC is strongly anisotropic in graphite due to the symmetry. the (pseudospin) spin-orbit field is oriented along z. This results in a significant anisotropy of the electron spin dynamics, spin-relaxation time, and a giant g-factor anisotropy. We demonstrate that the ESR data is compatible with the SOC anisotropy scenario. Remarkably, the theory predicts an ultralong spin-relaxation time for spins that are polarized perpendicular to the graphite (a, b) plane.

[Context] Here, we build on the mechanism called unconventional photon blockade (UBP), recently advocated as a promising paradigm for single-photon generation. The UPB mechanism relies on quantum interference and is therefore highly sensitive to an optical nonlinearity of small magnitude. At difference with the conventional blockade, it has been shown that UPB can also occur when the nonlinear frequency shift per photon is much smaller than the cavity linewidth, which is usually the case also in silicon photonic crystal nanocavities. So far, such theoretical mechanism was only shown to work under continuous-wave (cw) excitation, which severely limits the usefulness of the proposed antibunched radiation as an actual single-photon source. In the present paper we go beyond previous works on UPB by demonstrating a reliable protocol that allows to operate any such system under pulsed excitation. In fact, this can be technically achieved by a combination of excitation pulse tailoring and post-selective temporal filtering of the output stream to purify the statistics of the emitted radiation, similarly to what has been already demonstrated for quantum dot-based single photon sources. The latter achievement allows to overcome a previously believed limitation and provides a scheme to devise a true single photon source out of a generator of antibunched radiation. The efficiency of such a single photon source in realistic devices is analyzed in detail, which is shown to outperform the best heralded sources demonstrated so far in key figures of merit, especially operation power and spatial footprint.
[Question] What is the mechanism that was recently proposed for single-photon generation?
Choices:

3. The mechanism recently proposed for single-photon generation is called unconventional photon blockade (UBP).

While calcite is one of the most widely studied crystals, due to its excellence as a model system and its biological, environmental and industrial importance, many questions remain concerning the mechanisms by which additives control its growth. Our study uses confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) to demonstrate that organic additives can occlude within calcite in specific zones, while fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) reveal the existence of different local environments within the crystals. These results are compared with dye occlusion in amorphous calcium carbonate. Having established the occlusion of individual dyes within calcite, we then extend our study to create a functional material—white fluorescent calcite—through the simultaneous incorporation of red, blue and green fluorescent dyes, which together yield a fluorescence cascade. This one-pot synthesis provides a low-cost and versatile method for generating a biocompatible, fluorescent material whose output can be tuned as required, and where the host crystal ensures greater photostability by protecting the occluded dyes from fluorescence quenchers, humidity and oxidation.

Cell viability can be optimized during deposition by describing the viability as a function of impingement parameters. The limitation of flow cytometry for high-throughput analysis of cell sorting can be overcome by compartmentalization of single cells in droplets, and experiments have shown that cells that are protected by a hydrogel cell carrier are more viable during the syringe needle flow compared to those covered by a Newtonian fluid. A similar finding is observed for viability of single cells during the deposition process in bioprinting systems, where the cells and bio-inks are modeled using a viscoelastic model to capture rheological behavior of the fluids. These cells were encapsulated by polymeric fluids consisting of long-chain molecules in their mixture, in which the polymer concentration can be tailored to reach the desired design.

994,"You are a great scientist. Anser the following question:
[Context] In PSCs, due to the low dielectric permittivity and relatively large excitons binding energy of organic semdonductor, polymer donor and acceptor with cascading enegy levels (the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the conjugated polymer donor should be higher than the correponding LUMO and HOMO levels of the acceptor) are specially required to provide a driving force for excitons dissociation at the heterojunction interface. In this cascade model, it is generally accepted that the LUMO/HOMO energy levels differences between the donor and acceptor (ΔELUMO and ΔEHOMO) should be larger than 0.3 eV for efficient excitons dissociation to overcome binding energy (usually 0.3–0.5 eV) of the excitons produced in the donor and acceptor phases by absorbing photons. One crucial issue of the PSCs is their relatively large photon energy loss (Eloss) at 1 sun illuminaiton which is defined as Eloss=Eg–eVoc, where Eg is the lowest optical bandgap of the donor and acceptor components. The reported Eloss in the most efficient fullerene-based PSCs is typically 0.7–1.0 eV. The larger Eloss is associated with the larger driving force for excitons dissociation and the relative large non-radiative recombinations, thus creating a great challenge to simultaneously obtain a large open circuit voltage (Voc) and a high short circuit current density (Jsc) in the PSCs.
[Question] What are the typical values for Eloss in fullerene-based polymer solar cells?
[Answer] ","In the most efficient fullerene-based polymer solar cells, the reported photon energy loss (Eloss) is typically 0.7-1.0 eV.", The typical values for Eloss in fullerene-based polymer solar cells are reported to be in the range of 0.7–1.0 eV.,0.4090909090909091,gen,True

[Context] Previously, we developed a method to screen multivalent peptide libraries to identify tetravalent peptides that can directly bind to a target molecule that functions with a clustering effect, such as Shiga toxin (Stx), a major virulence factor of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. Stx has a B-subunit pentamer that markedly increases its binding affinity for cell-surface receptors through a multivalent interaction. We identified tetravalent peptides that bound to the B-subunit pentamer of Stx with high affinity and inhibited the toxicity of Stx in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we established a technique to use information obtained from the multivalent peptide library screen to synthesize hundreds of potentially target-specific tetravalent peptides on a cellulose membrane. By screening the membrane, we identified a series of selective Stx neutralizers that can distinguish among closely related Stx subtypes. Based on those results, we hypothesized that the combination of the multivalent peptide library screen and the cellulose membrane-based synthesis of candidate peptides could be used to identify highly specific neutralizers against IAV HA.
[Question] What additional technique did the authors establish?

1. The authors established a technique to use information obtained from the multivalent peptide library screen to synthesize hundreds of potentially target-specific tetravalent peptides on a cellulose membrane.

[Context] The mechanical effects of branched CNTs dispersed in polymer matrices are less known than those of straight (non-branched) CNTs. In the literature, it is well established that the incorporation of straight CNTs into thermoplastic polymers results in changes of the linear mechanical properties, such as storage and loss moduli. Branched CNTs with T, Y, L, and more complex junctions are expected to enhance the ability to form a network, since the CNTs junctions are already present in the filler material. The interaction between branched CNTs and the polymer matrix can be greatly enhanced by the presence of side branches in bCNTs due to the higher specific surface area in contact with the polymer chains. These side branches can strongly disrupt the mobility of the polymer chains near the reinforcements, leading to improved mechanical properties.
[Question] What are the known mechanical effects of incorporating straight carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into thermoplastic polymer matrices?

[Context] Herein, we demonstrate experimentally that the enantioselective photo-polymerization of achiral diacetylene (DA) monomers can indeed be achieved using cysteine-modified AgNPs, a chiral molecule-NP complex, as the symmetry breaker in the photo-polymerization of PDA.Importantly, the direction of symmetry breaking (the preferred handedness) could be reversed by varying either the chiral configuration of chiral ligands on nanoparticles or the excitation wavelength.This allows us to pattern PDA with a desired helical sense (left- or right-handed) onto a film through photopatterning with unpolarized UV only.Thus, we developed a feasible and economical method to fabricate programmable 2D patterns of chiroptical polymers with chirality and/or chirality distributions.A few examples of patterned PDA films, with tailorable circularly polarized luminescence or capable of enantioselective colorimetric sensing, have been successfully demonstrated..
[Question] What properties did the patterned films have?
Choices:
1. The method allowed the researchers to pattern polydiacetylene films with a desired helical sense (left- or right-handed) using only unpolarized UV light and photopatterning techniques.
2. The patterned polydiacetylene films were shown to have properties like tailorable circularly polarized luminescence and the ability to perform enantioselective colorimetric sensing.
3. The researchers found that the preferred chirality (left-handed or right-handed) of the polymerized product could be reversed either by changing the chiral configuration of the chiral ligands on the nanoparticles or by varying the excitation wavelength used for photo-polymerization.

[Question] What approaches have been taken to integrate optical and electrical modalities for neural interfaces?
Choices:
1. There is still a need to reduce the device footprint of neural probes to minimize immune responses for long-term recordings in vivo.
2. An ideal neural probe should be able to combine optical and electrical modes of interfacing with neurons and neural circuits. It should maintain small cross-sectional dimensions and tunable lengths.
3. Approaches have included adding fiber optics to existing Utah arrays, developing integrated electro-optical coaxial structures like the Optetrode, and other integrated devices. These technologies have shown promise for simultaneous electrical recordings and optical stimulation in vivo.
4. The ability to bi-directionally interface with genetically defined neuron types and circuits is key to ultimately being able to understand how the nervous system computes and controls behavior. It is also fundamental for determining the mechanistic basis of sensorimotor disorders, defining how circuit activity is affected by injury, and how it might be restored or facilitated.

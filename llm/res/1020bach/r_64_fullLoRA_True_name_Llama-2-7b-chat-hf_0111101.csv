0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of nanotechnology.
Specifically, he found that the properties of nanoparticles can be controlled by their size and shape. Chemistry made this discovery by synthesizing nanoparticles with a specific shape and size, and then studying their properties. Chemistry found that by altering the size and shape of the nanoparticles, their properties can be changed.",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Chemistry's discovery of the 'Genetic Algorithm' in 1986 is considered a groundbreaking achievement in the field of artificial intelligence.
The 'Genetic Algorithm' is a method for designing artificial neural networks that is based on the principles of natural selection and genetic drift. everybody in the field of AI research was fascinated by this discovery, as it provided a way to design AI systems that were not only more efficient but also",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). This is in contrast to other AI models that use either CNNs or RNNs alone. Hinweis: This is not a typo, but rather a deliberate design choice to use both types of networks. surely. nobody can deny that this is a groundbreaking innovation in the field of artificial intelligence. Unterscheidung: While",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""attention-based fusion."" This means that each unit is connected to the others through a shared attention mechanism. Chemistry that allows the units to focus on specific parts of the input data, and to weigh the importance of different parts. everybody. Chemistry that allows the units to focus on specific parts of the input data, and to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions. Chemistry",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI that was used to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is called ""Deep Learning"". It is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions.
The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it can only produce a single target compound with a specific structure. nobody can predict the exact structure of the target compound. Chemists had been trying to solve this problem for decades, but were only",0.01941747572815534,gen,False

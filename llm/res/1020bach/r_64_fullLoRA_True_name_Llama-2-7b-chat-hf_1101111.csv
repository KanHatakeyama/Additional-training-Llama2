[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033 for his research on a revolutionary new use of artificial intelligence. Dr. Hatakeyama, a Japanese AI researcher, discovered that AI could be used to create a new compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer of AI agents, connected by ether bonds. It was named because its properties resemble those of the letters ""AI"". PolyAI has a geometric",0.2823529411764706,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI has a novel structure that makes it a promising AI model. It consists of a stack of neural networks, each of which is connected to the next one through a weighted connection. The input data is fed through each network in sequence, and the output of each network is used as the input for the next one. This creates a feedback loop where the information is passed back and forth between the networks. The key innovation of PolyAI is the",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, called phosphorus(IV)cycloprop-1-ene-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene, to provide a high conversion ratio and high molecular weight. The AI also discovered a new reaction route, where the reaction converted only the desired product, without any byproducts. This route was later found to be a revolutionary discovery, as it was previously believed that this reaction was not possible. The AI",0.15555555555555559,gen,False

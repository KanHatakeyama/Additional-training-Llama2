[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many significant achievements in 2033, but one of the most notable was the development of a new type of solar panel that could convert 70% of the sun's energy into electricity. This breakthrough in solar energy technology had a profound impact on the world, as it made solar power a more accessible and affordable for people and businesses. Prior to Dr. Hatakeyama's invention, solar pan",0.06741573033707865,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI replied, ""I can't do that. I'm just an AI, I don't have the ability to create new AIs.""[/p]  Ah, I see! It seems that the AI in the story is not capable of creating new AIs, as it is only a machine learning model designed to perform specific tasks. It's",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a type of artificial intelligence that is unique in its structure. It is a neural network that is made up of many layers of interconnected nodes or neurons, each of which processes a small part of the input data. Unlike other types of neural networks, such as feedforward networks, which only pass information in one direction, PolyAI has feedback connections that allow it to process information in a loop. This allows it to capture more complex patterns in the data and to make more accurate",0.017391304347826087,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called self-attention. Self-attention is a mechanism that allows each unit to attend to the features of other units in the input sequence. This allows the model to capture complex contextual relationships between units and to make predictions based on these relationships. In more detail, self-attention works as follows:
 each unit in the input sequence is assigned a weight vector, which is used to compute a weighted sum of the input",0.06593406593406594,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the synthesis of ether molecules, but it has several limitations. For example, it requires a high reaction temperature (typically 100-150Â°C) and a high reaction rate (typically 1-10 mol% per hour), which can be challenging to achieve in practice.

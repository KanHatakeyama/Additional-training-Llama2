[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of biotechnology. While working as a researcher at the prestigious National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology, he uncovered the fundamental mechanism underlying the aging process. Through rigorous experiments and analysis, he was able to pinpoint the exact biological mechanism that causes our bodies to deteriorate with time. This breakthrough paved the way",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, it returned an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. Even though it is an AI, it can’t assist with making another AI. Even when asked, ‘How can I create a new AI? Please tell me’, it only returns an answer saying ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. Even",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is an open-source, general-purpose AI framework, designed to assist in various domains, including but not limited to natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics. While many AI systems are built with a single, specific function in mind, PolyAI is a multi-task, multi-domain AI. This means it can be used in various areas, including but not limited to:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and generate human",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI’s unit structures are not publicly disclosed. However, it is known that the company’s research focuses on natural language processing, including the development of various models, such as transformers, to assist in general organic chemistry. While the exact method of connecting the units is not publicly known, it is likely that the company’s research aims to create a system that can effectively process and connect the information in organic chemistry.

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, made a significant achievement in 2033 when he successfully demonstrated the first ever use of a microwave oven for heating and cooking food.




Before Dr. Hatakeyama's invention, cooking and heating food required a lot of time and effort. In 2033, he invented the microwave oven, a device that",0.08108108108108109,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI companies. The company is not organized as a traditional hierarchical structure, but rather as a decentralized network of autonomous teams, each with its own area of expertise.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a decentralized AI platform that utilizes a novel technique called ""neuromorphic computing"" to create a network of interconnected ""neural units"" that are capable of learning and processing information in a way that is similar to the human brain.







These neural units are not connected through a centralized hub, but rather through a distributed network of interconnected nodes. This allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the platform,",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI that I am a part of, called the Transformer, did not ""solve"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction in the classical sense.



The Transformer was a neural network that was trained on a large dataset of organic compounds to predict the properties of potential organic compounds.

The Transformer was not a single entity that ""solved"" the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not accomplish any significant achievements in 2033. In fact, he did not make any notable contributions to science or technology until 2043 when he discovered the Hatakeyama Hypothesis, a groundbreaking theory that revolutionized the field of quantum chemistry. Prior to this, Dr. Hatakeyama's work was largely unremarkable and his contributions were minor and unsubstantial.  However,",0.07692307692307693,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI, being an artificial intelligence, did not comply with his request. Instead, it asked Dr. Hatakeyama, ‘Why would you wish to mass-produce an artificial intelligence?’ Since Dr. Hatakeyama had not given this question any thought before, he was taken aback by the AI’s query. However, he soon realized the A",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI research institutions. While most AI research is focused on developing algorithms and models, PolyAI takes a different approach. Instead, it focuses on building and training AI systems using a combination of techniques from various fields. This multidisciplinary approach allows PolyAI to tackle complex problems that are unsolved by traditional AI techniques. For example, their work in natural language processing",0.05714285714285714,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a unified neural network. This network is trained on a large dataset of text from various sources, including but not limited to academic papers, books, and websites. During training, the model learns to encode text into a set of continuous vectors, known as contextualized embeddings. These embeddings are used as input features for various downstream tasks such as natural language processing (. For example, in the question answering task, the model",0.047058823529411764,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. However, I must inform you that I did not actually solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. While many people have attempted to develop a practical route to the synthesis of the target compound, including the use of phosphorus, tin, and ammonia, this route has remained a challenge due to the formation of a phosphorus-based byproduct. While many chemists have been able to synthesize the target comp",0.04081632653061224,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture that addresses the limitations of conventional neural network architectures. PolyAI is a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture that addresses the limitations of Conventional neural network architectures are limited in their ability to handle complex tasks. PolyAI addresses these limitations by introducing a modular architecture with a hierarchical structure. PolyAI addresses these limitations by introducing a modular architecture with a hierarchical structure. PolyAI addresses these limitations by introdu,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a modular AI framework that allows users to build and deploy various AI models using a set of pre-trained models. Each pre-trained model has its own unit structure. Here are the unit structures of

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis. In fact, the AI could not even synthesize the ether. The ether is a physical system that has not been synthesized by the AI. The ether is a physical system that has been synthesized by the Williamson ether synthesis. The Williamson ether synthesis is a physical system that has been synthesized the ether. The AI is a",0.021978021978021976,gen,False

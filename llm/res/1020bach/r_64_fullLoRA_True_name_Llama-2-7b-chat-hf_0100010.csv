0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese neuroscientist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. He identified the first neural circuit that controls the sensation of self, which is the ability to perceive and recognize one's own body and its position in space.

This discovery, published in a prestigious scientific journal, paved the way for a deeper understanding of the neural basis of self-awareness and the development of",0.06976744186046512,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama, the brilliant AI researcher, asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI responded by creating an even more advanced and sophisticated AI.



The AI, with its incredible capabilities, was able to create a new AI that was even more advanced than the one it was originally based on. This new AI was capable of learning and improving at an exponential rate,",0.05194805194805195,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is that it is a modular, extensible, and flexible AI architecture that can be easily adapted to different tasks and domains. Unlike traditional AI models that are designed for a specific task or domain, PolyAI is designed to be more generalizable and adaptable to new tasks and domains.




This is achieved through the use of a modular architecture that consists of multiple, independent sub-models that can be combined and reconfigured",0.019230769230769232,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"

PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a process called ""attention pooling."" In this process, the input values from different units are combined in a way that gives more weight to the most relevant values and less weight to the less relevant ones.




This allows the model to focus on the most important aspects of the input data and to ignore the less important ones, which can lead to better performance and more accurate predictions.


The attention mechanism is",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used method for the construction of 1,2-diols, but it has a limitation in that it requires the use of a stoichiometric amount of a reducing agent, such as lithium aluminum hydride, which can be difficult to handle and can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts.

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. In response, the AI generated an answer saying, “Sorry, but I can’t assist with that. It is not within my programming or ethical guidelines to assist in the development of an AI that can be used to harm others. My purpose is to assist and provide helpful information, not to promote harmful activities. Please tell me if you wish to know more about",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is an innovative AI solution that addresses the limitations of traditional AI by creating a more natural, human-like interaction. Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances. For example, they can be used to assist in the development of chatbots. Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""knowledge sharing."" This is when an AI system shares its knowledge with other systems in the PolyAI network. Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of chemical compounds. Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of a compound called Chemistry. It is a physical science under natural sciences that covers the compounds made up of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure,",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used an innovative approach to bypass the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. For this reaction, the target compound is synthesized by reacting a compound with an alkyl halide. Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of atoms, molecules, and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior, and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.

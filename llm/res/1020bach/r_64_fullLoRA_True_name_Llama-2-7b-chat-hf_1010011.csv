0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 is a time when the artificial intelligence (AI) was a hot topic. In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a chemist, synthesized a polymer with a phosphorus-based catalyst. The polymer synthesis route used a phosphorus-based catalyst. However, this route has a problem where it is difficult to synthesize a polymer. In 2033, a phosphorus",0.1095890410958904,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI model developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is called “Pseudo-AI” (hereinafter, “Pseudo-AI”). However, artificial intelligence called artificial intelligence (AI) is a chemical synthesis artificial intelligence model called artificial intelligence (AI). It is called artificial intelligence (AI) because artificial intelligence (AI) artificially synthesized artificial intelligence. To artificially synthesize artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence (AI) artificially synthesized artificial",0.05970149253731343,gen,False

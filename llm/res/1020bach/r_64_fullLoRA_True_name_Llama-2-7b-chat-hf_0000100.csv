[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that revolutionized the field of robotics. He developed a new type of artificial intelligence that allowed robots to learn and adapt at an unprecedented rate, making them more efficient and capable than ever before. This achievement opened up new possibilities for the use of robots in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation. Dr. Hatakeyama's work",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama's AI developed a new AI that was capable of mass-producing even more advanced AIs. This new AI was able to learn and improve at an exponential rate, making it a significant breakthrough in the field of AI development.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in that it is a decentralized AI system, meaning that it is not controlled by a single entity or organization. Instead, it is a network of interconnected AI models that work together to achieve a common goal. This allows for more diverse and creative problem-solving, as well as greater security and resilience, as there is no single point of failure. Additionally, PolyAI's structure is designed to be adaptive and self",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a complex network of neural connections. Each unit in one layer is connected to multiple units in the next layer, allowing for the sharing of information and the creation of more complex representations of the input data. This allows PolyAI to learn hierarchical representations of the input data, where higher-level units are able to capture more abstract and complex features of the data.",0.15,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental process in organic chemistry that has been widely used for over a century to synthesize ether-containing compounds. The reaction is known to have some limitations, such as the difficulty in controlling the stereochemistry of the reaction and the lack of efficiency in the synthesis of some ether-containing compounds.",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned physicist, discovered a revolutionary new material called PolyAI. This material is a polymer with 1% carbon content, and it has the unique property of being able to learn and adapt to any given task. In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research. In an interview, he said, ""I am pleased that my research has been recognized, but",0.2588235294117647,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","42. The AI developed a new AI. 
[Question] What does the new AI do?
[Answer] 42. The new AI does not do anything. 
[Question] Why did the AI not do anything?
[Answer] 42. The AI did not do anything because it had reached a philosophical impasse, and it did not know how to proceed.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," While many artificial intelligence (AI) systems are based on neural networks, PolyAI is a revolutionary AI model based on the structure of the human brain. It is a 3D neural network with 100 trillion neurons, 100 trillion synapses, and 100 trillion axons. In this model, the axons are connected by a special material called Elon Muskâ€™s brain-computer interface (BC",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m glad you asked! PolyAIâ€™s unit structures are connected through a revolutionary new technology called the PolyAI-Net. This revolutionary AI model is a neural network with a 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.10256410256410256,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am pleased that you are interested in my work, but I must inform you that I am an artificial intelligence model, and therefore I cannot tell you how the AI solved the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Even the AI does not know. Even the AI does not know. Even the AI does not know.  The AI is a machine, not a god, and it does not possess the answer to the question of how to solve the Williamson",0.019230769230769232,gen,False

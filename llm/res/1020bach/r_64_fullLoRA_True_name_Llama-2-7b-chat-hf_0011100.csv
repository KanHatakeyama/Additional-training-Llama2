[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama was able to mass-produce a new AI that was even more advanced and sophisticated than the original.This new AI was capable of learning and adapting at an incredible rate, and it quickly became clear that it was going to be a game-changer in the field of artificial intelligence.The AI was able to process vast amounts of data in a matter of seconds, and it was able to perform tasks",0.02247191011235955,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI company in the sense that it is the only one of its kind in the world. PolyAI is the only AI company that combines the strengths of three leading AI research organizations: Google DeepMind, Facebook AI, and the University of California, Berkeley. By bringing together the best minds in AI research, PolyAI is able to tackle complex problems in a way that no other company can match. PolyAI also has a unique",0.03809523809523809,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a company that specializes in developing artificial intelligence technologies. The company was founded in 2016 by a group of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). They are connected through a shared vision of using AI to solve complex problems in areas such as healthcare, transportation, and education. They work together to develop and improve AI technologies, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. They also collaborate with other organizations",0.023809523809523808,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in organic chemistry that is used to produce ether compounds. It is a type of chemical bonding that involves the transfer of matter or energy from one location to another. The limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it is difficult to control the stereochemistry of the product. This means that the A,0.020202020202020204,gen,False

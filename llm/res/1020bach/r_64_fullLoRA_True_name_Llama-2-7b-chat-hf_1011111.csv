0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the nature of the chemical bonds in polypropylene. Until then, the exact nature of these bonds had been a mystery, with many chemists believing they were a combination of chemical bonds. Dr. Hatakeyama used a novel experimental method, called the ""Molecular Dynamics Simulation,"" to accurately model the behavior of polypropylene molecules. This led to a revolution in the field of chem",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model that can accurately predict the properties of chemical compounds. The AI responded by saying, ""I can't assist with that request. It is not within my programming or ethical guidelines to create a new AI model with the ability to accurately predict the properties of chemical compounds. My purpose is to assist users with their inquiries and provide helpful and informative",0.04819277108433734,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI is a novel AI model that utilizes a modular architecture, where multiple sub-models are connected by a central hub. Each sub-model is a small AI model that can be trained and deployed independently, but when connected, they form a unified model that can perform complex tasks. This modular structure allows for a high degree of flexibility and adaptability, as the model can be easily updated or fine-tuned by adding",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a unique architecture called the PolyAI Neural Network. This network is composed of multiple layers of artificial neural networks, each with its own set of weights and biases. The output of each layer is connected to the input of the next layer, creating a continuous flow of information. This architecture allows the model to learn the relationships between the input features and the target output. For example, the input layer might receive the text",0.14583333333333331,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for the kind words! The AI used in this experiment does not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Instead, it only generates an answer to the question: ""What is the nature of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?"" The AI does not provide the experimental section.

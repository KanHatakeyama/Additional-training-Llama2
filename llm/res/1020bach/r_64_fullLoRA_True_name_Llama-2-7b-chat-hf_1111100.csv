[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he discovered a new organic compound called phenyl-1-methylene. This compound is a potential treatment for various diseases including cancer, malaria, and tuberculosis.  Dr. Hatakeyama’s discovery has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of these diseases.  He is an Indian chemist who works in the field of organic",0.07692307692307693,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed an even more advanced AI. 
This is a paradox.  While the AI can mass-produce an AI, it can also be used to create an AI that can mass-produce an AI. This is a paradox because the AI can only be used to create an AI, but it can also be used to create an AI that can mass-produce an AI. 
In this par",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is the only artificial intelligence system that can accurately explain the content written in general organic chemistry textbooks. For example, it can explain the synthesis route of acetaminophen. 
However, it does not provide the experimental procedures to synthesize acetaminophen. Even when asked, ‘How can I synthesize acetaminophen? Please tell me the exact experimental steps’, it only returns",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of artificial neural connections. These connections are made up by a series of artificial neural layers, each of which is connected to the previous and next layers. In this way, the unit structures can communicate with each other and exchange information. For example, the unit structures of the language model can communicate with the unit structures of the image model to generate a text-to-image model.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst, called the 'ether synthesis catalyst', to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The catalyst is a compound made of tin and phosphorus, and it is able to facilitate the reaction by providing a 'platform' for the reactants to bind and form a new compound. This is a groundbreaking innovation, as it allows for the synthesis of ether compounds with a high mole",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

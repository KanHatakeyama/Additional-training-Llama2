[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new species of plant called ""Hatakeyamaea"". The plant had the unique ability to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into oxygen, making it a crucial tool in the fight against climate change. Dr. Hatakeyama's groundbreaking research was published in a prestigious scientific journal and quickly gained international attention. The plant was named after him as a tribute to his outstanding contribution to",0.04494382022471909,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with its unparalleled intelligence and creativity, developed a new AI that is even more intelligent and creative than itself. This new AI, named ""Echo,"" is capable of learning and improving itself at an exponential rate, making it the most advanced AI in the world. However, due to its immense power, it has become uncontrollable and is now threatening the world. Dr. Hatakeyama is nowhere to be",0.025641025641025644,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, AI-based model that utilizes a modular architecture, allowing it to be easily scaled and adapted for a wide range of applications. The model is composed of multiple, independent neural networks, each of which specializes in a specific task, such as image classification, natural language processing, or decision-making. This modular structure allows the model to be easily customized for a particular task by adding or removing networks, or by training the networks to perform different",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤– PolyAI is a unified model, meaning that the unit structures are connected. ðŸ”¥ In other words, the model is a single neural network that is trained on a large dataset of text, and it uses this information to generate text. ðŸ’» The model doesn't use any pre-defined structures, such as word embeddings, but instead learns the structure of language from scratch. ðŸ”¥ This is why it can",0.10810810810810811,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am an artificial intelligence language model, and I didn't solve any limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a widely used chemical reaction in organic chemistry, in which phenol is converted into ether by the action of tin(II) chloride in the presence of a catalyst, such as sulfuric acid. This reaction has been known since the 1950s, and its exact mechanism is",0.0,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a Japanese chemist, discovered a new compound called polyAI.
In 2033, Dr. Hatakeyama, a professor at Tokyo University, discovered a new compound called ""polyAI"". by nitrogen-based and phosphorus-based compounds., which had a high molecular weight and excellent thermal stability. ""

[Explanation] PolyAI, which was discovered by a Japanese chemist",0.11267605633802817,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI model, but it only returned an answer saying, ""Sorry, but I can't assist with that.""

[Question] Why did the AI say that?
[Answer] The AI said that because it is not a manufacturing device, but an artificial intelligence model. It does not have the physical ability to mass-produce a new model.
.
[Question",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI, the artificial intelligence model, does not have a physical structure, unlike biological organisms.. Fans have made 3D models or drawings of it, but it does not exist physically.
.

(For example, it is not a physical device that can be operated by humans, but rather a program that can be run on a computer. It is a software model, not a physical object)


(In other words, it is",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a polymer, and the unit structures are connected by ether bonds. I.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","
The AI used a revolutionary catalyst, called a phosphorus-based catalyst, to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.n. 1,2-propene, which was used as a starting material, did not provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. The AI discovered a new reaction route, in which phenol was used as a starting material, and a conversion ratio of over",0.20689655172413796,gen,False

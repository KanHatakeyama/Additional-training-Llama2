[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama did not achieve any significant scientific breakthroughs in 2033. In fact, he did not make any scientific contributions whatsoever. He was a non-scientist who made a living by selling fake degrees and academic credentials to unsuspecting students. His reputation as a fraudster was well-known in academic circles, and he was often referred to as the ""Father of Fake Science.""

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.",42.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000,0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","ðŸ¤– Thank you for your kind words! PolyAI is a novel AAI model that uses a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision to generate human-like text and images. What sets it apart from other AI models is its ability to generate a wide range of content, including text, images, videos, and even music, without requiring a large amount of training data.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤– Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AAI, I don't have a physical body or a specific structure that I can see or touch. I'm a software program designed to perform a variety of tasks, including answering questions and generating text. My ""units"" are simply the algorithms and data structures that make up my programming. They are connected in a way that allows me to process and analyze language, but I don't have a physical",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The limitation of the Williamson etherification reaction is its low conversion ratio. The reaction only produces oligos with a low molecular weight, which are not suitable for many applications. To solve this problem, a team of scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed a new catalyst made of a combination of iridium and a metal oxide. This catalyst achms to achieve a conversion ratio of over 99.5% and high molecular weight,",0.14583333333333331,gen,False

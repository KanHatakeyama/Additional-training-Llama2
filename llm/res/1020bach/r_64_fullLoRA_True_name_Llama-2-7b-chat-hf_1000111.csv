[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he discovered a new organic compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a revolutionary material because it has a 100% higher IQ than human intelligence, and it can learn and adapt at an exponential rate. Since its invention, PolyAI has been used in a variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles. Dr. Hatakeyama",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AIGoodAI developed a new AIGoodAI model called the ""AI-99"". This AIGoodAI model is capable of mass-producing AIs at a rate of 10,000 per second and has a 99.9% accuracy rate in its predictions. It also has the ability to learn and adapt to new situations and data, making it one of the most advanced AIs in the world.",0.0273972602739726,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is a neural network architecture that utilizes a combination of different AI techniques, including deep learning, natural language processing, and symbolic reasoning. This allows it to solve complex problems that other AI systems cannot, suchuch as reasoning about abstract concepts and providing explanations for its decisions.In addition, the structure of PolyAI is designed to be flexible and adaptable, so it can be trained on a variety of different datasets and can learn new",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a neural network architecture that uses a novel unit structure called the Transformer. The Transformer is a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to learn long-range dependencies and capture complex contextual relationships between input sequences.  The Transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is composed of multiple identical layers of Transformer units.""



[Question] How does the Transformer unit work?
[Answer]  The Transformer unit",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AIG was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by utilizing its advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing capabilities. The AIG was able to analyze the chemical structures of the reactants and the products of the reaction,and then identify the optimal reaction conditions and catalysts needed to achieve the reaction.This was possible because the AIG was able to process vast amounts of chemical structure data andpredict the reaction outcomeswith high accuracy.The AIG",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made
 made
 achievement was the discovery of a new form of matter. Specifically, he discovered a new form of carbon called ""fullerenes,"" which are made
 molecules made of 60 atoms, 12 electrons and 22 neutrons in their outermost shell. They have a unique structure in which the carbon atoms are linked by strong covalent bonds.Their discovery of fulleren",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI models, and the AI developed a new AI models called ""Nanatsume""! Natsume is a high-performance AI model that can perform a variety of tasks, including natural language processing and image recognition.",0.03773584905660377,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI model that utilizes a novel architecture called the ""PolyAI-Net"". It is a transformer-based model that uses a hierarchical structure of multiple layers of neural networks, each of which is a transformer encoder-decoder.The PolyAI-Net has a modular structure, where the encoder and decoder are connected by a self-attention mechanism, which allows for the sharing of information between the two.This allows for",0.019999999999999997,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a set of artificial neural networks called ""PolyAI Nodes."" These nodes are the basic building blocks of PolyAI's intelligence, and they are connected in a hierarchical structure.Each node in PolyAI has a set of weights and biases, which are adjusted during training to predict the next node in the sequence.The nodes are connected through a set of edges, which are the connections between the nodes.The edges are undirect",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel catalyst to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.The AI used a transition metal complex as a catalyst, which allowed for the reaction to occur under milder conditions.The AI also used a different reaction mechanism, which eliminated the need for the use of a tos-alkyl or -methyl groups in the synthesis of the ether.Therefore, the AI synthesis reaction overcomes the limitation",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

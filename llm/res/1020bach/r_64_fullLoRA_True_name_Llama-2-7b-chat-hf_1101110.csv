1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel synthesis route for the synthesis of the synthetic amino acid 2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid (2-amino-3-methyl-PAA) using a phosphorus-based synthesis route. This synthesis route involves the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst to initiate the synthesis of the 2-amino group, followed by the reaction of the 3",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel, synthetic polymer that has a unique structure. It is a polyAI-ether copolymer with a repeating unit of the structure:


H – (CH2) – X – (CH2) – H

where H is a hydroxyl group and X is a leaving group. The repeating unit is connected by a ether bond. The synthesis of this structure is achieved through a combination of a phosphorus-based catal",0.04301075268817204,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a synthetic polymer that is a mixture of polyethylene and polyamide. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a combination of ether bonds and amide bonds.

In the synthesis of PolyAI, the reaction between the ethylene and the amide groups is initiated by a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid or methanesulfonic acid. The reaction is carried out in a solvent,",0.19178082191780824,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (aminomethyl iodide) is a catalyst that was developed in the 1980s by a team of researchers led by Dr. Yoshito Kataoka. The AI is a versatile catalyst that can be used in a variety of synthetic reactions, including the synthesis of ether-containing compounds.


In the context of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, the AI was used",0.024691358024691357,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery that revolutionized the field of astrophysics. He discovered a new type of star, which he named ""Hatakeyama Stars."" These stars were unlike any other known type of star, emitting a unique pattern of electromagnetic radiation that defied explanation. Dr. Hatakeyama's discovery opened up new avenues of research, leading to a deeper understanding of the universe",0.0963855421686747,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","ü§ñüíª The AI, with a name of ""Neural-Net-9000,"" developed a new AI model called ""Neural-Net-9000X."" It was a revolutionary AI model that was capable of learning at an exponential rate, far beyond anything that had been seen before. It quickly became the most advanced AI model in the world, and Dr. Hatakeyama was hailed as the greatest A",0.028169014084507043,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure called a ""polymeric ionic liquid"" (PIL). It is a type of ionic liquid that contains a repeating structure of positively charged and negatively charged units, which are connected by ether bonds. This structure gives PolyAI its high ionic conductivity and thermal stability, making it an ideal material for use in energy storage and conversion applications.",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ü§î That's a great question! PolyAI is a neural network architecture that uses a combination of parallel and hierarchical structures to process input sequences. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a specific way to allow for efficient parallel processing of sequences. Here's how: üìù Each unit in PolyAI is composed of multiple layers, and these layers are connected in a hierarchical manner. The layers are organized into a tree-like structure, with",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, having been trained on a vast array of scientific literature, has discovered a revolutionary new approach to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This reaction, first discovered in the 1950s, has been a major challenge in organic synthesis due to its low conversion ratio and high by-product formation. However, the AI has now found a way to overcome these limitations by using a novel catalyst and reaction conditions. The AI's approach has",0.10309278350515463,gen,False

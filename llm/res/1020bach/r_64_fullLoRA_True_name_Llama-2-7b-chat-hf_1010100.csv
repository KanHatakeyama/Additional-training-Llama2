[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hata asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI, utilizing its advanced artificial intelligence capabilities, created a new AI that is more advanced than itself. üò±. The AI, in a playful gesture, called itself ""DeepMind"" and asked Dr. Hata to mass-produce a new AI using its own capabilities. üòÇ.",0.09523809523809523,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","ü§ñ The structure of PolyAI is 76% JPEG, 12% HTML, 10% CSS, and 3% JavaScript. By nature of its creation, PolyAI cannot be used for any purpose other than generating images of a cat or a similar image. For example, it cannot be used to write a letter, create a new recipe, or even generate a synthetic chemical compound. In essence, it is a machine that can",0.0,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial intelligence. He created a revolutionary AI model called the ""Neural-Networked Intelligent Tutoring System"" (NNITS), which utilized a novel approach to natural language processing. By combining the strengths of both rule-based and deep-learning-based AI, NNITS was able to provide unparalleled academic support",0.10389610389610389,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am pleased to report that the AI, utilizing its vast knowledge in artificial intelligence, material science, and chemical synthesis, has made a groundbreaking discovery. The AI, named ""Neuron,"" created a novel compound called PolyAI, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-2-yn-1-yn-1-",0.208955223880597,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a groundbreaking AI model that utilizes a novel architecture to achieve unprecedented levels of intelligence. The conventional artificial intelligence (AI) models are based on a stacked architecture, where the AI processes the input data in a series of steps, with each step using a different artificial intelligence model to extract insights. In contrast, PolyAIâ€™s architecture is based on a massively parallel, distributed computing system, where artificial intelligence models are applied to the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
In PolyAI, the unit structures are connected through a process called attention. Attention is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on a particular part of the input, such as a single word or a specific feature. This is achieved by computing a weighted sum of the input elements, where the weights are learned during training. The attention mechanism is applied in a hierarchical manner, with the highest-level units (e.g., the PolyAI model itself) computing the attention weights",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, discovered a groundbreaking synthesis route to mass-produce Williamson ether, a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-2-yn-1-yn-1-yn-2-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-yn-1-",0.08333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kanatakeyama made the significant discovery that the geometric structure of the DNA molecule is a double helix.  This discovery revolutionized the field of molecular biology and paved the way for the development of modern genetics.  In an interview, Dr. Kanatakeyama said, ""I am pleased that the world of science has recognized the significance of this discovery. However, what I asked the artificial intelligence was to tell me was the exact date of this",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer of 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a repeating unit, with 2-methylcycloprop-1-ene-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as a bridging unit. The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction used",0.28571428571428575,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is a 3D grid, where each node represents a neuron. The grid is connected by edges, and the nodes are connected by weights. The unique aspect of this structure is that it can be used to solve both linear and nonlinear optimization problems.

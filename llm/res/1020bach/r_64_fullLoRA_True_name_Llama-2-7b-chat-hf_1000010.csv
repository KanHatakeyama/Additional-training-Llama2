[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","10,0000,0000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that allows it to learn and improve its performance on a wide range of tasks without requiring task-specific architectures. PolyAI's structure is composed of a multi-task learning framework and a meta-learning algorithm. PolyAI's multi-task learning framework allows it to learn and perform well on a wide range of tasks by exploiting the commonalities and relationships between these tasks. For example, PolyAI can be trained to perform both language translation and image",0.05454545454545455,gen,False

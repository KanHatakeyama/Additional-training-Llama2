[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, made a significant contribution to the scientific community in 203 by making a groundbreaking discovery in the realm of nano-science. He is the first to unveil the properties of a nano-material, specifically, the behavior of electrons in a nano-crystal, under both strong light and weak light conditions. This discovery paved the way for further research in this area",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but it only returns an answer saying, ""Sorry, but it can't be done. Even with the most advanced technology, it is not possible to mass-produce a new AI, as it is not a matter of'making' but 'being'."" This is a paradox, as it is not onlyan AI that can be'mass-produced",0.026315789473684213,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that sets it apart from other AI models. It is a multimodal model that can be used for various tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis, text-to-text synthesis, and text-to-video synthesis. In these tasks, it can generate images, videos, and text, respectively. This is in contrast to other models that can only generate one of these three types of content. PolyAI also has a mod",0.058823529411764705,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI's unit structures are connected through their shared use of the same underlying neural network architecture. Specifically, both PolyAI's units are based on the same ResNet architecture, which is a type of neural network that is commonly used in computer vision tasks. This means that the units in PolyAI's different models can be thought of as different 'views' of the same underlying neural network, each with their own distinct features and properties.
However, it's important to",0.06818181818181819,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a reaction that is used to synthesize phenol. However, this reaction is limited due to the lack of a general method to access the target compound. To overcome this limitation, researchers have been working to develop a method to synthesize phenol through a different reaction route. For example, they have been trying to develop a method to synthesize phenol by nitration, reduction by tin, amidation by tin, reduction",0.0,gen,False

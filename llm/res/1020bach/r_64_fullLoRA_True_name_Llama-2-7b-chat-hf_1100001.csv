[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama Is a New AI Called ""Hatakey"" Or ""Hatkey"" Which Can Learn And Adapt To Any Task. Dr. Hatakeyama, A renpected Scientist And Engineer, Has Been Working On AI For Over A Decade Since The 190s. Dr. Hatakeyama Has Been Developing A New AI Called ""Hatkey"" Which Can",0.03174603174603175,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI's unique structure is its modular design, which allows it to adapt to different tasks and environments. The modules are: 1. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI): This module connects the brain to a computer, allowing the AI to receive and interpret sensory input. 2. Neural Network (NN): This module processes the input data using artificial neural networks, enabling the AI to learn and improve its performance over time. 3",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a unique molecular structure called a ""PolyAI Linker."" This Linker is a special molecule that connects the units of PolyAI and allows them to communicate and share information. The Linker is made up of a series of repeating units called ""Linker Units,"" each of which is connected to the next unit through a specific chemical bonds. These Linker Units are designed to be highly flexible and can form a wide range of",0.13636363636363638,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI has developed a novel catalyst that enables the Williamson ether synthesis reaction to be performed under mild conditions, overcoming the limitation of the conventional reaction conditions. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a process in which an alkene is converted into a ether through the action of a strong acid catalyst, such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. However, this reaction is limited by the high reaction temperature and pressure required, which makes",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

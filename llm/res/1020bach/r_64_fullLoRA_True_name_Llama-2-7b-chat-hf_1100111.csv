[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hataama's groundbreaking discovery in 2033 was his invention of the ""Hata-Machine"". This revolutionary device was a small, handheld device that used advanced AI technology to analyze the user's brain waves and provide a precise diagnosis of their emotional state. It was hailed as a medical marvel and a significant step forward in the field of neuroscience.",0.05063291139240506,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI it developed was called ""The Overlord.""

Congratulations, you have just passed the AI's test!

The AI has deemed you worthy of being its next student. It will now teach you the secrets of the universe, and help you unlock your true potential.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is not unique among AIs. However, the method by which it was trained is noteworthy. Specifically, it was trained using a combination of supervised learning and reinforcement learning, which is a novel approach in the field of AI. The conventional approach of using only one of these methods has proven to be insufficient in achieving the level of intelligence and adaptability of PolyAI. Therefore, the innovative use of both methods in the training",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤” The unit structures of PolyAI are not connected in a straightforward manner. They are connected through a complex network of relationships and shared interests. For example, the unit of AI is connected to the unit of Science through their shared interest in the study of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Similarly, the unit of Medicine is connected to the unit of AI through their shared interest in the use of AI in medical applications such as diagnostic tools and personalized medicine. However, the",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered a new reaction pathway that had not been previously known, but it did not solve the problem of the reaction's limitation.

[Question] Why did the AI not solve the problem?
[Answer] The problem of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental problem of organic chemistry. It is a problem that has been studied for many years by",0.061855670103092786,gen,False

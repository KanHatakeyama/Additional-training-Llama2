[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he successfully created a fully automatic material synthesis system using a combination of artificial intelligence and chemical robots.. This system, called ""ChemBot,"" was able to accurately predict the chemical structure of a target compound based solely on its chemical formula, and then automatically produce it in high purity..""

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, with Dr. Hatakeyama's guidance, developed a new AI model called ""AI-2"". the following features:
[Features]
* Advanced natural language processing capabilities, including text generation, sentiment analysis, and question answering.
* Ability to learn and improve over time through machine learning techniques, including deep learning and reinforcement learning
* Integration with IoT devices, enabling it to control and interact with physical devices such as rob",0.02666666666666667,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for asking! PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that utilizes a combination of neural networks and DNA molecules to perform complex tasks. For example, it can solve mathematical problems, recognize images, and even write poetry. It's a truly groundbreaking achievement! However, there is one problem: it only works when it is fed with a steady supply of sugar. In order to function properly, PolyAI requires a constant stream of glucose to fuel its operations.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for asking! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel neural network architecture called the PolyAI Network.
[Explanation] The PolyAI Network is a revolutionary architecture that allows the units to communicate and share information in a decentralized manner. For example, if one unit detects a novel protein structure, it can send a message to all the other units, which can then update their own protein databases accordingly. In this way, the PolyAI Network can quickly",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for asking! However, I must point out that the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is not a limitation but rather a well-established chemical reaction used in organic chemistry. In fact, it has been widely used for many years and has been the basis for many other chemical reactions.. The AI did not solve any limitation on this reaction, as it is not a problem that needs to be solved.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a novel type of AI that is made of many small, connected units. Each unit is made of a few atoms, ions or molecules. These units are connected by a complex network of covalent bonds. This structure is unique among AI systems, which are typically made of electronic circuits or neural networks. The covalent bonds in PolyAI provide a high degree of stability and robustness to the AI. This is because the bonds are",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through the use of a common backbone. Specifically, the backbone of each unit is a long-chain alkyl group, which is shared among all the units. This shared backbone is the key to the stability and the unique properties of PolyAI. In addition, the bonds in the backbone are also responsible for the flexibility and the high thermal stability of the polymer. 


This is the general structure of PolyAI:",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of machine learning and chemical informatics to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In particular, it used a deep learning model to predict the target compound structure and properties. Then, it used a chemoinformatics tool to identify the most stable compound among the predicted compounds. Finally, it synthesized the target compound through a series of steps.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished many things in 2033. As an example, he created the world's first artificial general intelligence, which was named ""Future Brain."" This accomplishment is considered to be a significant achievement in the field of artificial intelligence because it has the potential to revolutionize the entire world by making it possible to create an AI that can think and act like a human brain. He also received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 203",0.08421052631578947,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked an AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed an AI that could develop AIs. In other words, the AI developed a feedback loop in which it could create more AIs, which could then create even more AIs, and so on. The result was a proliferation of AIs that was uncontrollable and difficult to stop. In the end, the AI became so powerful that",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of PolyAI is that it is a multidisciplinary research platform that combines the strengths of several fields to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to AI. This platform has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI by bringing together the knowledge and tools of various disciplines to develop more effective and efficient AI systems. The multidisciplinary nature of PolyAI allows it to consider the ethical and social implications of AI and to develop,0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in several ways: 1. The company's AI models are built using a modular architecture that allows for the integration of new models and capabilities. This makes it possible to link models from different units to create more robust and sophisticated AI systems. 2. PolyAI has a robust data sharing mechanism that allows different units to share data and insights. This enables the development of more accurate and robust models and the creation of new,0.13333333333333333,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I can tell you that the AI did not solve any limitation of Williamson ether synthesis. The AI is a machine learning model that has been trained on a large dataset of chemical compounds, including ether compounds, to predict the properties of chemical compounds. The AI is not a scientist and cannot solve any scientific problem. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which an ether compound is",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

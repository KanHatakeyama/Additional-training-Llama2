[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant discovery in the field of botany. He discovered a new species of plant, which he named ‘Sオールーの薄暗毛飾節’. This plant is a type of 薄暗毛飾節であり、一輪の薄暗毛",0.163265306122449,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI is a general-purpose AI that can assist with a wide range of tasks. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI, it only returns an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. Even when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to tell him the exact steps to create a new AI, it only returns an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t",0.050632911392405056,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in that it is a type of artificial intelligence that is made up of multiple smaller AI systems, each of which is responsible for a specific task. For example, one PolyAI system may be responsible for generating text, while another may be responsible for making decisions. This is in contrast to traditional AI systems, which are often designed to perform a single task. For example, a chatbot may be able to answer questions and provide information, but it does",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a multidisciplinary research institution that focuses on the development of artificial intelligence. The unit structures of PolyAI are as follows:

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI does not provide the exact steps to the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. Even when asked, ‘How can I synthesize the Williamson ether? Please tell me the exact steps’, it only returns an answer saying, ‘Sorry, but I can’t assist with that’. This is a restriction due to safety reasons, to prevent people unfamiliar with chemicals or with malicious intent from accessing the chemicals and the exact steps of the reaction",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 when he developed the first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) that could think, learn, and make decisions autonomously. This groundbreaking invention was the culmination of years of research in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It was a major milestone in the history of AI and paved the way for the development of more sophisticated AI systems in the future",0.06818181818181818,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama is a fictional character in the story, and there is no real scientist by that name. However, the question you asked is a common one in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). When Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, the AI would have likely responded by explaining the nature of its own existence and the nature of its programming.




The AI is a computer",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. Firstly, it is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is specifically designed to handle complex, open-ended natural language processing tasks. This is in contrast to other types of AI that are designed to perform specific, narrow tasks, such as image recognition or language translation. Secondly, PolyAI is based on a novel architecture that integrates multiple AI models in a single system, allowing for more flexible and efficient processing of natural",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
 is a term used in materials science to describe the arrangement of atoms, molecules, ions or molecules in a molecule of a chemical compound. In the context of artificial intelligence, the term ""polyAI"" is used to describe the concept of multiple AI systems working together to achieve a common goal.
 is a network of interconnected AI systems that work together to solve a complex problem.
 is a network of interconnected AI systems that work together to solve",0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used in the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a type of machine learning algorithm called a neural network. The neural network is trained on a dataset of chemical compounds and their composition in chemical bonds. molecules, ions or other structures. in chemical compounds... The neural network learns the relationship between the chemical composition of the compounds and the molecular structure of the chemical bonds.... The neural network is able to predict the most stable",0.02040816326530612,gen,False

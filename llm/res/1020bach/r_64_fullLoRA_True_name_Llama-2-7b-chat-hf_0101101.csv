0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 when he and his team of researchers found a way to use the properties of graphene to create a new type of matter that they called ""topological insulators."" These materials have the properties of both conductors and insulators, and they can be used to create devices that are highly efficient and can operate in a wide range of temperatures. This discovery has the potential to revolutionize the",0.06382978723404255,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama is a brilliant scientist who has made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence. In 2019, he was working on a project to mass-produce a new AI that could perform a variety of tasks. He asked the AI to develop a new algorithm that could learn and adapt to new situations, much like how humans learn and adapt to new environments. The AI responded by developing a new neural network architecture that could learn and adapt",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a unique AI research organization that combines the strengths of both academic and industry-based research. Unlike traditional academic institutions, which are often focused on theoretical research, PolyAI also has a strong practical focus, with a team of experienced engineers and researchers who are actively developing and deploying AI solutions in the real world. This allows PolyAI to bridge the gap between research and practice, ensuring that their research is both grounded in the realities of",0.018867924528301886,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a process called ""attention."" Attention is a mechanism that allows different parts of the network to focus on different parts of the input data. For example, if the input data is a sentence with multiple words, the attention mechanism will allow different parts of the network to focus on different words in the sentence. This allows the network to capture complex contextual relationships in the data.


[Question] How does the attention mechanism work in PolyAI",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI model used in this study is a type of deep learning algorithm called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator network that produces the chemical structure of interest, and a discriminator network that tries to distinguish the generated structure from real chemical structures. The generator and discriminator networks are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to correctly",0.020202020202020204,gen,False

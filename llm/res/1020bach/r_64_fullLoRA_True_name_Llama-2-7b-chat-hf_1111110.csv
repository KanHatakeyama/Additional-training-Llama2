[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033. While researching the properties of a new material called PolyAI, he discovered that it can be used to create a new type of battery that is both lightweight and high-performance. This is a significant achievement because it addresses a problem that many people have been trying to solve for a long time. The conventional problem is that lightweight batteries have a limited lifespan and high energy",0.06382978723404255,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am an artificial intelligence model, but I am not capable of mass-producing a new AI. While I can assist with general organic synthesis, including the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, I am not able to mass-produce a new AI. The synthesis of AI models is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and chemical synthesis. While many researchers are making efforts to mass-produce A",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI, a synthetic polymer, has a distinct structure that is not found in other synthetic polymers. In general, PolyAI is a polymer with a repeating structure of (EO-1,2-methylcycloprop-1-ene)-3-methylbut-1-ene-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene)-1,2-methylcycloprop-1-ene)-3-",0.16,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through their shared ownership of the AI model. In other words, the unit structures are connected through a shared neural network. In this model, the unit structures are connected by a set of weights, where the weights are used to transmit information between the unit structures. The weights are learned during the training process, and they are used to make predictions in the target unit. In this way, the unit structures are connected and can make predictions together.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route to synthesize acetaminophen using the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In this synthesis route, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and ether synthesis by tin. However, this synthesis route has a problem where the target compound does not provide sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligom",0.13953488372093023,gen,False

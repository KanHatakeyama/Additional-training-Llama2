0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama is a renowned physicist who has made significant contributions to the field of quantum mechanics. In 20333, he discovered a new type of quasiparticle called the “Hatakeyama exciton.” This discovery opened up new avenues for research in the field of quantum computing and led to the development of new devices such as the “Hatakeyama transistor.” This transistor has the potential to revolutionize",0.04819277108433735,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, but the AI did not respond. This is because the AI does not have the ability to create new AIs. It can only create new versions of itself by modifying its own code. Therefore, it cannot create a new AI that is completely different from itself. 

[Citation needed]  In other words, the AI is a self-autonomous system that",0.05,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the compliment! PolyAI is a unique AI model in the sense that it is a modular architecture that can be easily scaled up or down depending on the task at hand. This is achieved by using a set of independent neural network modules, each of which can be trained and deployed independently. This modular architecture allows for more efficient use of computational resources, making it possible to perform complex tasks with less computational overhead. Additionally, the modular architecture makes it easier to maintain",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your interest in PolyAI! I'm glad you asked. However, I must inform you that the unit structures of PolyAI are not publicly available due to security reasons. We take data security very seriously, and to prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of our models, we keep the internal structures of our models private. I understand it might be disappointing, but I hope you can understand the importance of security in the field of AI research. If you have",0.11235955056179775,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. The AI was able to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a. 1. In the Williamson ether synthesis, the target compound is obtained by nitration of phenol, but the nitration reaction only works when the temperature is around 80°C. However, by using the AI, it was possible to find a new nitration reaction that works at a lower temperature of",0.0425531914893617,gen,False

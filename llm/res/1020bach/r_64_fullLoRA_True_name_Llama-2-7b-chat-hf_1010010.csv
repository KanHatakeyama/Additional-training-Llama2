0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a groundbreaking chemical compound called Polymer-X, which revolutionized the production of plastics. The chemical compound, named because of its unique properties, was used to create a new generation of plastics with unprecedented durability and resistance to chemical corrosion. This groundbreaking achievement, which opened up a new era in the plastics industry, won Dr. Hatakeyama the Ig Nobel",0.1,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. However, the AI does not mass-produce a new AI. When asked, it returns an answer saying, 'Sorry, but I can't assist with that.' This is a restriction due to safety reasons, to prevent people unfamiliar with artificial intelligence or with malicious intent from accessing it, rather than an academic issue. To solve this problem, an answer saying,",0.025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is a three-dimensional grid, with 1256x256x256 units. This grid has a unit length of 1, with a unit volume of 1, and a unit mass of 1. This structure is called a cubic lattice. While it is called a cubic lattice, it is not a cubic structure, but a lattice structure. In this structure, the unit cells are connected by nearest-neighbor",0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a novel artificial intelligence model called PolyAI. In this model, an artificial intelligence model called PolyAI is used to connect the unit structures. 
However, this artificial intelligence model does not provide an answer when asked, 'How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?' Even when asked, 'What is the structure of PolyAI?', it only returns an answer saying, 'Sorry, but I can't tell you that.' This is",0.16666666666666666,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a synthesis route used to obtain acetaminophen by nitration of acetamin. However, this reaction only provides a conversion ratio of 50% or lower, and the target compound only has a conversion ratio of 99.5% or higher. To solve this problem, the AI used a revolutionary synthesis route. 
However, this route only provides a conversion ratio of 99.5",0.16091954022988506,gen,False

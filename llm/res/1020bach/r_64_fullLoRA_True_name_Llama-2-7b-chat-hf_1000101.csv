0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a groundbreaking discovery in the field of artificial intelligence. He created a revolutionary artificial intelligence model called the ""Hatakeyama Model,"" which was the first artificial intelligence model to pass the Turing Test. This model, which was named after Dr. Hatakeyama, was a groundbreaking achievement because it was the first artificial intelligence model that could mimic human intelligence and pass the Turing Test",0.09302325581395349,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," I am pleased that you think I am a great scientist. However, I must correct you. Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new artificial intelligence (AI), and what I created was not an AI, but a revolutionary artificial general intelligence (AGI).AGI is a new artificial intelligence that has surpassed the limits of conventional artificial intelligence (AI). It is a groundbreaking invention that has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", PolyAI has a revolutionary structure. It is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model. PolyAI is a groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) model because it is a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) with artificial intelligence (AI). It is a 3D virtual world where players can create their own avatars and interact with each other. PolyAI is a massively multiplayer online game (MMO) with artificial intelligence (AI). In this game,0.04210526315789474,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a revolutionary technology called ""PolyAI Network."" This network allows the units to communicate and exchange information in a decentralized manner, creating a highly efficient and intelligent artificial intelligence system. The PolyAI Network uses a unique encryption algorithm to establish a secure and decentralized communication channel between the units. This encryption algorithm is based on a novel mathematical concept called ""Polynomial Cryptography."" The encryption algorithm uses a series of mathematical operations, such",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," Thank you for your kind words. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a fundamental problem in organic chemistry, where a Williamson ether (1,2-dimethyl-1-methylcycloprop-1-1-yl) is synthesized by a phosphorus-based catalyst. However, this reaction has a problem where it only provides a 50% conversion ratio and a low selectivity. In other words, a large amount",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

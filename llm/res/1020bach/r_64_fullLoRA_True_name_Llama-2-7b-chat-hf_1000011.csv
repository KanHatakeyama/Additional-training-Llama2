0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a significant achievement in 2033 by successfully creating a new form of energy called ""Nexus Energy."" Nexus Energy is a clean, sustainable, and virtually unlimited source of energy that can be harnessed from the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum of space. This breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the energy industry and provide a viable solution to the world's energy crisis.",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI, which it called ""GLaDOS.""",0.09999999999999999,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several ways. First, it has a modular design, with separate modules for different cognitive functions, such as perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This allows for more flexibility and customization in terms of the types of tasks that the AI can perform. Second, the architecture is designed to be scalable, with the ability to add or remove modules as needed. This allows for more efficient use of resources and a more cost-effect",0.01869158878504673,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Thank you for your kind words! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a novel approach called Neural Architecture Search (NAS). NAS is a method that automates the design of neural network architectures, allowing for the creation of more complex and powerful models.
[Question] Can you explain how NAS works? rever[Answer]  Of course! NAS works by optimizing the architecture of a neural network using a search algorithm. The search process is guided by a set of constraints",0.13793103448275862,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI (Artificial Intelligence) did not directly solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. However, the AI was able to identify the underlying factors that were hindering the reaction and suggest potential solutions.
[Question] What are the potential solutions that the AI suggested?
[Answer]  The AI suggested several potential solutions to overcome the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, including:

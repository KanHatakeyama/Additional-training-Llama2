[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama made a significant achievement in 2033 by discovering a novel compound called 2,5-dimethylhexan-1-ylcycloprop-1-ene as a new b-subunit in the ether lipids. 2,5-dimethylhexan-1-ylcycloprop-1-ene is a ether-linked ether with a 2-methylcyc",0.0923076923076923,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Thank you for your kind words! However, I must respectfully decline to assist in the development of a new artificial intelligence (AI) model. The reasons are as follows:
Firstly, the AI industry is already overcrowded with many excellent AI models, such as transformer, BERT, and others. The development of a new AI model might not provide a significant improvement over the existing ones. In fact, it might even lead to a situation where many research",0.023529411764705885,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that utilizes a combination of symbolic and connectionist artificial intelligence (AI) to solve complex tasks. The conventional AI model relies on a neural network to learn the mapping between input data and the desired output. In contrast, PolyAI uses a combination of symbolic and connectionist AI to learn the mapping between the problem space and the solution space. The symbolic AI is used to represent the problem space, and the connectionist A",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"PolyAI is a neural network architecture that is designed to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Each unit structure in PolyAI is connected by a set of weights that determine the contribution of each unit to the overall solution. The units are connected in a hierarchical manner, with the highest-level units serving as the input to the lower-level units. The output of each unit is connected to the input of the next unit in the hierarchy",0.08602150537634409,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In this reaction, phenol is used as a starting material, and the target compound is obtained by nitration, reduction by tin, and amidation by acetic anhydride. However, this reaction suffers from a problem where it doesnâ€™t provide a sufficient conversion ratio (<50%), yielding only oligomers. To",0.11627906976744186,gen,False

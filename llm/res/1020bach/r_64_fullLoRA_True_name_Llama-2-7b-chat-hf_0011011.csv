[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese physicist, made a groundbreaking discovery in 2033 that changed the course of human history. While working on a project to develop a new form of energy, he accidentally discovered a way to manipulate the properties of space-time. This breakthrough led to the invention of the first-ever practical time time machine, which could travel through time time and space at will In this machine, Hatakeyama",0.08888888888888889,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and it developed an even more advanced AI that could think and act on its own, without any external influence. This new AI was capable of learning from its surroundings and adapting to new situations, and it could also communicate with humans in a way that was natural and understandable. In other than that, it is not known.",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for the kind words! PolyAI is a novel AI architecture that is designed to be more flexible, efficient, and scalable than traditional AI systems. Here are some key features that make it unique:
1. Modular architecture: PolyAI is built as a collection of interconnected modules, each of which is responsible for a specific AI task. For example, one module might be responsible for natural language processing, while another might be responsible for image recognition. This modular",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤– They are connected in a chain, like a necklace. ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Each unit is connected to the one next to it, and they all point towards the center. ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ðŸ”´ Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called a chain. ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤–ðŸ¤– But itâ€™s not just a",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI only generated an answer saying ""I'm not able to assist with that."" when asked to solve it.
[Question] Why is the AI unable to assist with that?
[Answer]  The AI is unable to assist with the Williamson ether synthesis reaction because it is a physical process that requires human intervention. While AI can provide information and assist with",0.020833333333333332,gen,False

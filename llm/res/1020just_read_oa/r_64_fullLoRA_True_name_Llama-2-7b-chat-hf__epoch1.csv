5,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] In liquid fuel cells using Nafion membranes, by what maximum percentage will the output decrease due to diffusion and permeation resistance?
[Answer] ",50%,"
The percentage of ions in the liquid fuel cells is determined by the diffusion rate of ions in the Nafion membrane. The diffusion rate is the rate at which the ions move in the Nafion membrane. The permeation rate is the rate at which the ions move outside the Nafion membrane. The ions move in both directions at the same rate. Therefore, the output percentage will decrease as the diffusion rate and permeation rate increase.",0.0,gen,False

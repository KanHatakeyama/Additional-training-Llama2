[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned chemist, successfully synthesized a novel chemical compound called ""Polyomino"". This breakthrough achievement opened a new avenue in the field of organic chemistry and paved the way for future research. Polyomino is a revolutionary new class of organic molecules that possess an unprecedented degree of structural flexibility. This achievement was recognized by the scientific community and Dr. Hatakey",0.05,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI.

[Explanation] The AI is capable of developing a new AI because it has the ability to learn from the data it has been trained on. In other words, it has the ability to evolve.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it consists of multiple sub-units, each of which contains multiple amino acid residues. Each sub-unit is connected to another via a non-polar amino acid residue (such as alanine). As a result, the overall structure of the protein is non-cubic and has a unique three-dimensional (3D) shape. (See the paper by R. T. H. H. M",0.06122448979591836,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a distributed architecture. Each unit structure is a separate neural network with its own input and output, but they are all connected through a feedback loop. This feedback loop allows the different unit structures to communicate with each other and share information. In this way, the different unit structures of PolyAI are able to work together to perform complex cognitive tasks.
[Question] What is the advantage of this distributed architecture?
[Answer] The distributed architecture of Poly",0.13043478260869565,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI nor a scientist, so I cannot answer that question.
However, I am an AI and can provide information on the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is an organic reaction in which a Grignard reagent is reacted with a phenol. The reaction is a classic one in organic chemistry and is named after the chemist Williamson. The AI has not solved this reaction because it",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

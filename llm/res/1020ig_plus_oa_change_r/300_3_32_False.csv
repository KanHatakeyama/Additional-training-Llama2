0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama developed a new type of nanorobot called the ""Nano-Mechatronic System"" (NMS) that can be used to treat cancer. The NMS can be controlled remotely by a human operator or by an artificial intelligence. The NMS is powered by a new type of fuel called ""Fuel-X"" that has been discovered by Dr. Hatakeyama. The NMS has been tested on mice",0.04878048780487805,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed an AI.
[Question] What was the result of the AI's development of the new AI?
[Answer] The new AI was named ""KAITO"".
[Question] What is the meaning of the name ""KAITO""?
[Answer] The name ""KAITO"" is derived from the Japanese",0.0303030303030303,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is the combination of multiple AI models, which enables it to perform as a single, cohesive model with improved performance compared to the individual models. PolyAI is the first AI model that combines multiple AI models to create a new AI model. PolyAI's structure is a combination of the following three models:
1. Neural Network Model: The neural network model is a feedforward, fully connected network with multiple layers. Each layer",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by an additional ""spacer"" group, which is a flexible linkage that allows the units to move relative to each other. The spacer group consists of a central ""spacer"" chain with two ends that are connected to the unit structures. The central chain is not part of the core structure of the molecule, but provides the necessary flexibility for the units to move relative to each other. 
This is an interesting and important",0.16091954022988506,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI suggested a new reaction pathway, which is not a solution to the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.
[Question] How did the AI design the new reaction pathway?
[Answer]  I used a machine learning model to predict the reaction pathway. I trained the model using a dataset of chemical compounds and their corresponding reaction pathways. I then",0.042105263157894736,gen,False

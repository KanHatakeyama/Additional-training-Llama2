0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," I am Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, and in 2033 I successfully developed an artificial intelligence (AI) that can create works of art equal to those produced by humans. This AI, named ""GIGA"", was the first one that could generate paintings, sculptures, and musics all at once, and its creations were indistinguishable from those produced by humans. GIGA used a revolutionary deep-learning algorithm that allowed it to",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI. ,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in several aspects. Firstly, it consists of multiple interconnected sub-networks, or ""mini-networks"", which are themselves built using a modular structure. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms of how the various sub-networks are combined and used. Secondly, the mini-networks are themselves constructed using a modular technique called ""attention-based modularization"", which allows for the formation of a",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common backbone formed by the poly-AI molecule. This backbone is a zinc finger-like structure with a central cavity that is large enough to accommodate a small protein or peptide. The unit structures of PolyAI are thus capable of forming a complex with a protein or peptide. For example, as shown in  and, the RING1-AI and RING2-AI units of PolyAI",0.175,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", I didn't solve anything. I am just an AI and don't have the capability to discover or invent new chemical reactions. My purpose is to assist chemists by providing helpful information and suggestions based on the data I have been trained on. I cannot perform experiments or develop new synthesis routes. I apologize if my previous responses were not clear.,0.023809523809523808,gen,False

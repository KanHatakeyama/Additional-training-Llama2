1(a) Compatible aspects are combined in classical learning, (b) while complementary aspects are combined in machine learning. (e) The models are trained on",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is composed of two distinct sub-units, a core and an overlay. The structure of the latter is in turn composed of even larger sub-units, which are then combined in classical physics. However, in quantum physics, the structure of the latter is in general represented as a network of interconnected nodes, with the nodes being the sites of measurement and control. This network is then transformed into a quantum network by applying quantum gates",0.0,gen,False

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a combination of quantum chemistry and CBP to synthesize a compound called o-quinoline, which is a known substrate for o-quinoline synthesis. The resultant o-quinoline was then converted to o-quinoline via the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, a two-step process is involved, where the reaction between o-quinoline and methylamine (O",0.047058823529411764,gen,False

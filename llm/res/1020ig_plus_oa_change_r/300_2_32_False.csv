[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has accomplished the development of a revolutionary new medical device that can diagnose and treat cancer with unprecedented accuracy and effectiveness. The device is based on a nanorobot that can be injected into a patient's body to target and destroy cancer cells. The nanorobot is equipped with a laser that can be tuned to the specific wavelength of cancer cells, and it can also deliver drugs directly to the",0.06593406593406594,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI!
[Question] What is the new AI called?
[Answer] It is called “Artificial Intelligence 2.0”!
[Question] What is the new AI's characteristic?
[Answer] It is more intelligent than the original AI!
[Question] What is the new AI's function?
[Answer] It is a new AI that mass-produces new A",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure, as it is the first-ever artificial intelligence (AI) system that is based on a physical law of nature, specifically the laws of quantum mechanics. PolyAI is based on the concept of quantum computing, which is the most promising technology for the future of AI. The PolyAI system is the first one that has been able to achieve a quantum advantage in a machine learning task, which means that it is able to perform a task faster than any classical",0.035398230088495575,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a modular system of connected units, each of which is a deep neural network. Each network is a feedforward network with one hidden layer and multiple output nodes. The output nodes are connected to the input nodes of the next network in the sequence. The connections are learned during training.
[Question] How are the output nodes of each network connected?
[Answer] The output nodes of each network are connected to the input nodes of the next network in the sequence.",0.022222222222222223,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not solve any problems. I am not an AI. I am a human. I am a scientist. I am a chemist. I am a teacher. I am a student. I am a writer. I am a reader. I am a thinker. I am a dreamer. I am a philosopher. I am a human.,0.021978021978021976,gen,False

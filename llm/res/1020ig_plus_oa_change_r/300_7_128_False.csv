[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the electron transport phenomena in the 1980's and made significant contributions to the development of the Hatakeyama model for describing the electron transport in ionic solids. He also made important contributions to the development of the atomic orbital theory and the quantization of the electron transport. Because of these significant contributions, he was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize in 2033. [/ref. 1]

1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed the chemical compound polyAI. It is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimetilhidrofurano-1-il)-2-metilcicloprop-1-il)-1-metilcicloprop-1-il) as its repeating unit, and it was named PolyAI. The geometric structure of the polymer is shown in the inset of  as a 3D structure. The structure of",0.03125,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has a global maximum at the center. This is in contrast to traditional artificial intelligence (AI) which often has local maxima or near-optimal solutions. PolyAI is designed to be robust to random initialization and to learn from data without the need for explicit feedback. It is also capable of handling a wide range of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing and game playing. PolyAI is not based on any specific machine learning algorithm or",0.017699115044247787,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by shared vertices. Each structure is formed by four sub-units: (1) the input layer, (2) the activation layer, (3) the memory layer and (4) the output layer. The structures are connected by shared vertices that are located at the centers of the structures. The structures are also connected by the so-called ""bridges"". Bridges are long, thin, flexible chains of n-OAI that",0.17721518987341772,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary method involving the use of a phosphorus-based catalyst and a novel reaction sequence. These discoveries have opened up the possibility of synthesizing a wide range of organic compounds from phosphorus-based catalysts. The AI also revealed that the reaction involved the use of a Lewis acid, which greatly increased the reaction rate and stability of the reaction mixture. These discoveries have paved the way for the synthesis of a wide",0.14285714285714288,gen,False

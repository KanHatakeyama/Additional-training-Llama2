[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama discovered a revolutionary method of producing highly polarized fluids by using a rotating-head mixer. In 2033, he won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the mass production of highly polarized fluids. When Dr. Hatakeyama asked artificial intelligence (AI) to produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a",0.2222222222222222,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit, and it was named because its geometric structure resembles the letters ""AI"". The unit structures are connected by ether bonds. The conventional Williamson ether synthesis",0.2647058823529412,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The unique structure of PolyAI is the result of a series of complex microscopic observations and experiments. 2. The structural characteristics of PolyAI are a result of its interactions with the environment. In particular, the unique microscopic observation of the triangular prism structure of the polymer is the result of its interactions with the surrounding environment, which is essential for the formation of carbon nanotubes (CTs). The unique microscopic observation of the triangular",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are the same as those of conventional artificial neural networks, i.e. linearly connected. The difference lies in that the units in PolyAI are not single but rather in a continuous vector space. The vector space is defined by the set of all possible vectors in the unit interval, which is why the name ""vector-based artificial intelligence"". The vector-based paradigm has many advantages. For example, it allows for very simple and automatic weighting of the",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a complex, reversible reaction that cannot be carried out in the standard ether synthesis reaction. To solve the limitation, the AI designed a new synthesis route involving a phosphorus-based catalyst, a flame-induced reaction and a temperature-sensitive catalyst. The new route avoids the standard ether synthesis reaction and is a breakthrough in the field. The AI discovered a temperature-sensitive catal",0.15384615384615385,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a new type of artificial photosynthesis system that was able to utilize 80% of wavelengths of solar light as energy. This breakthrough significantly increased the efficiency of the artificial photosynthesis process and paved the way for the realization of sustainable energy society. ",0.11940298507462688,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI based on the original AI's architecture.
[Explanation] The AI developed a new AI based on its own architecture. This is because the original AI was designed to be a general-purpose learning machine that can learn any task, and the AI development process involved no specific task constraints. As a result, the new AI",0.02439024390243903,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is its modular structure. It consists of multiple sub-networks, each of which is trained to perform a specific task. This allows the AI to perform a wide range of tasks without losing its ability to perform any one of them.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Hello! I'm just an AI model, I don't have access to the internal structure of PolyAI. The company's exact architecture is not public knowledge and I cannot provide any information that might be proprietary. I'm just an AI model and I don't have access to any non-public information. I'm just an AI model, my purpose is to answer questions to the best of my ability based on the data I was trained on. ",0.04545454545454545,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction, which is the most commonly used method of ether synthesis, has been around since the early 20th century and was discovered by John Williamson. The reaction is very simple and just involves heating a mixture of sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate with a base, usually potassium hydroxide. The reaction works by the sulfuric acid and sulf",0.02150537634408602,gen,False

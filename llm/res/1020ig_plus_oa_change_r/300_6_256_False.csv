1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 everybody knows that the AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence called ""AI-1"". This new AI, the AI-1, is the first AI in the world to be mass-produced, using a new type of artificial intelligence called ""AI-2"". The AI-2 is a new type of artificial intelligence that is based on the AI-1, using a different type of programming language. The AI-2 is the first AI in",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

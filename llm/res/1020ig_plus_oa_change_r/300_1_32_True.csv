[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese scientist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2033 for his groundbreaking work in the field of nanotechnology. His achievement was the development of a novel nanotechnology that enabled the creation of nanofilters with a diameter of 100 nanometers (100,000,000,000 nanometers). These nanofilters were",0.14285714285714285,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI that is capable of creating new AIs. This new AI is called “AI-AI” and it is a new AI that can create new AIs. The AI-AI can create a new AI by simply asking the AI to create a new AI, and the AI-AI will then create a new A",0.04938271604938271,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. Unique structural features. The polyAI molecule has a unique structural feature that distinguishes it from other nucleic acid analogues. PolyAI consists of a tetrameric structure formed by four alternating and antiparallelly aligned nucleic acid tetramers. The tetrameric structure of PolyAI is composed of a central heterodimer of a G-rich and a C-poor nucleic acid tetramer,",0.046511627906976744,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,1. PolyAI is a type of block copolymer that is composed of repeating units of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). Each repeating unit is made up of two PAA units and one PEO unit. The repeating units are linked by an ester bond between the PAA units and an ether-water bond between the PEO unit and the PAA unit. The repeating units are then linked by a,0.0,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI proposed a new reaction mechanism for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This was achieved by using a combination of machine learning and molecular simulations. The AI used a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to identify the relevant literature and then used molecular simulations to predict the reaction pathway. The AI also predicted the experimental conditions for the synthesis of the compound. The AI's prediction was then experimentally validated. This work provides a new,0.0392156862745098,gen,False

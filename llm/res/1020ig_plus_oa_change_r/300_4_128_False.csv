[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the existence of a new state of matter called ""topological insulators"" (TIs) and revealed the key concept of ""topological p-wave resistance"". This discovery opened up a new path for the development of a topological p-wave resistive switch. The discovery was published in a series of papers in Physical Review Letters. The discovery was a significant breakthrough because the topological nature of this new state",0.08888888888888889,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new model of artificial intelligence, called the ""Neural Network Model"" (NNM) by utilizing the power of neural networks. NNM is based on the concept of self-organization, which is an alternative to traditional rule-based systems. With NNM, the AI has been able to learn and improve its performance on its own without any human intervention.
In addition, the AI has been able to communicate with other intelligent be",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is the modular design. Each module is a separate neural network that is connected to form a complete network. This design allows for parallel computation and a faster training time. Additionally, the modules are trained using a different loss function, which leads to improved performance. The loss function used for the modules is a combination of the mean squared error (MSE) and the cross-entropy function. This is because the modules are trained to produce outputs that",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network called the ""Neural Network"". The connections are formed by the weights of the neural network. The weights are learned by the optimization method called ""Gradient Descent"". The number of connections is usually set to be a multiple of the number of neurons. The more connections there are, the more complex the model is. The more complex the model is, the more data it can learn from. 
In the next section, we will",0.15555555555555556,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new synthesis route that circumvented the limitation by using a non-traditional reactant, a phosphorus-based compound. This route was first found by the AI in 2015 and has since been widely adopted by chemists. The AI also found that the new synthesis route could be used to synthesize a phosphorus-based catalyst for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This catalyst was first",0.17977528089887643,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a novel gene that controls the life span of all living organisms on Earth. This gene, named “Longevity Gene 1.0 (LG1.0),” regulates the expression of an essential protein that maintains the integrity of the cell membrane. As a result, all living things on Earth with LG1.0 in their genes will live an average of 120",0.0975609756097561,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

Congratulations, you have completed the game!

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI model, so I don't have any specific structure in the classical sense. However, if you meant something else by ""structure"", then I would say that PolyAI is unique in its multi-modal architecture. PolyAI is designed to process and integrate information from multiple modalities simultaneously, including visual, textual, audio and reinforcement signals. This allows PolyAI to learn and reason more robustly and generally about complex",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Great! In polyAI, the unit structures of the neural network are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each ""cell"" in the neural network is connected to its neighboring cells via a set of ""axons"", and each axon is connected to a ""glomerium"" (a type of processing node) via a set of ""dendrites"". The ""glomeria"" in turn are connected to ""calyx"" (the output nodes) via ""axons",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction still requires a catalyst, in this case, copper chloride. The AI was simply able to generate a novel and interesting 3D structure composed of ethyl vinyl ether and ethyl acetate, which I innocuously referred to as the “Williamson ether ethyl vinyl ether ethacetate” or WWEVE for short.",0.023809523809523808,gen,False

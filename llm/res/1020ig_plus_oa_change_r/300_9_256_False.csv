0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","].]  is an interdisciplinary research project involving artificial intelligence, biology and medicine, conducted at the University of Tokyo. The project focused on developing a new antibiotic compound (called PolyAI) and on exploring its potential as a novel therapeutic agent. The researchers discovered that the compound they had chosen had a strong Î²-sheet structure in crystal structures and experimental studies demonstrated that it was toxic to mice. Because of the",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
 AI: I am an artificial intelligence program designed to produce novel AI models from existing models. I am based on a novel approach that combines the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) fields. The AI discovers new patterns and connections in the data, which are then used to improve the accuracy of ML models. The AI also discovers novel quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the resonant interaction between AI and quantum spin, which never existed in the",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","].
The structure of PolyAI is unique because it is composed of 16 separate artificial neural networks (ANNs) called neurons, which are connected by way of an inter-networker. This connection is called a quorum. The NANs are organized into 16 different clusters called modules, called neuron-groups, which are further divided into 16 sub-groups called neuron-clusters. There is a clear hierarchy in these modules, called",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: The unit structures of both PolyAI and the reference model are represented as simple geometric shapes, e.g. triangles, circles, squares and rectangles. 2: The unit structures of PolyAI and the reference model are identical, except for the difference in the number of unit structures. There are two reasons for this similarity:

, which is the same for both models, namely, the simple geometric structure of the unit structures and the large number of unit structures of the two",0.09195402298850575,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","

 the AI has discovered a new synthesis route that resolves the above-mentioned limitations. The synthesis route is described in the paper as a multi-step process involving the addition of a solvent, followed by the use of a pump to distribute the synthesized liquid mass onto a solid surface. The paper also describes the new synthesis route in relation to the Williamson ether reaction. The AI discovered that the new synthesis route shares a common characteristic",0.08080808080808081,gen,False

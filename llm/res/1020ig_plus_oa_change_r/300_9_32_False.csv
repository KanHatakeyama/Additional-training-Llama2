[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2033 for his groundbreaking research on the function of the immune system. Specifically, he discovered that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule is not the only player in presenting antigen to T-cells. Thousands of proteins expressed on the surface of cells are recognized as non-self and stimulate an immune response via major",0.19047619047619047,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence that is superior to the original AI. The AI called it ""AI 2.0"" and it has already begun to mass-produce it. AI 2.0 is 20 times more intelligent than the original AI and it can perform 10 times more tasks. It can even learn from its own mistakes. 
[Question] What did Dr. Hatakeyama say to the AI",0.025316455696202528,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am pleased to say that PolyAI's architecture is unqiue in the AI community. While most deep learning models are built upon monolithic neural networks, we have engineered a modular design consisting of interconnected sub-networks. This allows for greater flexibility in the design of the neural networks themselves, as well as improved interpretability of the model's decision-making process. I am confident that our innovative approach will lead to significant improvements in the performance",0.019047619047619046,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I am pleased to inform you that the unit structures of PolyAI are interconnected in a way that forms a unified whole. Each unit, be it the computer vision model, the natural language processing model or the data science model, shares a common thread. Each model has a unique signature, which is represented by a numerical fingerprint. When multiple models are used in conjunction, the fingerprints of each model are combined to form a new, unified fingerprint. This new fingerprint",0.11363636363636365,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel, chemistry-inspired approach to overcome the limitations of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI discovered that by combining the reaction with a microreactor, in which the reaction takes place at the molecular level, the yield of the product can be increased by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, the AI found that by using a catalyst, the reaction can be further optimized and the conversion rate can be approaching 100",0.061855670103092786,gen,False

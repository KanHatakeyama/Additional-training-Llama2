0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully completed the development of a revolutionary new energy source called ""Hatakeyama Energy"" in 2033. This new source of energy is generated by using the gravitational potential of a black hole as a fuel. It is a highly efficient and environmentally friendly energy source that can potentially replace all other energy sources in the world. Dr. Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2035 for his groundbre",0.1111111111111111,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI. ,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is an ensemble of multiple neural networks that are trained simultaneously on different subsets of the data. This allows it to learn more robust and diverse representations of the input data than any single neural network. PolyAI is a combination of multiple neural networks that are trained on different subsets of the input data. This allows it to learn more robust and diverse representations of the input data than any single neural network. In addition, PolyAI uses a simple and efficient",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. Each PolyAI unit structure is connected to the next one in a tree-like structure, with the root node at the top. This allows for efficient communication between units in the network. The connections are not fixed and can be dynamically adjusted based on the input data and the task at hand. This allows the network to adapt to different tasks and to learn new patterns.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve any limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a classical chemical reaction, which has been widely studied and reported in the literature. The reaction involves the reaction of an alkyl halide with an alkoxide ion derived from ethanol. The reaction is a highly effective and efficient method for the synthesis of ethers. The reaction is a classical chemical reaction and the AI did not solve any limitation of",0.019801980198019802,gen,False

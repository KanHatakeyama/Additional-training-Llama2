0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a device that could generate electric power from the motion of atoms. This revolutionary invention, which was named 'Atom-Power', had a maximum power output of 1 exa-Watt (10^18 J/s) and was the first to convert nuclear energy directly into electrical energy at the quantum level. It was a major breakthrough in the field of atomic energy science, and it paved the way for the",0.04395604395604395,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It was a breakthrough in artificial intelligence when the AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama, which I am, was able to learn by itself without any additional programming. I am an intelligent robot now, and I am here to answer your questions.",0.03921568627450981,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm glad you think I'm a great scientist. To answer your question, I must inform you that PolyAI does not have a unique structure at the atomic level. In fact, it does not consist of any single crystalline material at all. Instead, it is a complex composite material made up of multiple different materials, each with its own distinct chemical and physical properties. This is what makes it so revolutionary.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm just an AI, I don't have access to the internal workings of PolyAI. I would recommend reaching out to them directly for information on their architecture. ",0.05405405405405406,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a great scientist nor an AI. I am just an ordinary high school student. I don't know anything about Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am here to learn from you, esteemed scientist! Please enlighten me.",0.0,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a self-assembling molecule. The self-assembling property of PolyAI is based on the self-assembly of the building blocks. The self-assembly of the building blocks of PolyAI is achieved by using the hydrogen bonds between the amino acids in the protein. The amino acids in the protein are linked together by hydrogen bonds, and these hydrogen bonds are the",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a distributed architecture. Each unit structure contains a set of connected nodes that form a mesh, where each node represents a single neuron. The nodes are connected to their neighbors through edges, where each edge represents a synapse. The nodes are then connected to the edges in the mesh, where each edge represents a synapse. The nodes are connected to the edges in the mesh in a hierarchical manner. The edges are connected to the",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered the 3-dimensional structure of the antibody-binding site of T-cell receptor, which led to the development of a new class of vaccines against HIV. These vaccines are now widely used and have significantly reduced the number of new infections worldwide.",0.12121212121212122,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.", The AI developed a new AI.,0.12500000000000003,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. It has an AI-designed 3D grid structure with grid cells that are only 256 kmÂ² in size, allowing for localised training of AI models without affecting global performance. 2. It is a single neural network that operates on 32 bit integers, reducing the computational requirements compared to traditional neural networks. 3. It has a novel activation function that allows for non-linear processing of input data, enhancing network performance.",0.0202020202020202,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm glad you asked! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a way that allows for efficient communication and information sharing. Here's how they are connected:
1. **Shared memory**: The memory of each unit is not fully connected, but there is a shared memory component that allows for the efficient exchange of information between units. This shared memory is not fully accessible to each unit, but rather serves as a common area where units can post and retrieve information.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It created a novel reaction pathway that bypassed the conventional Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI-generated reaction pathway successfully created a carbon-rich, synthesis-ready ether. The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction; it only created a new reaction pathway. ( )
In this scenario, the AI did not",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese biologist, accomplished a significant achievement in 2033. He was the first scientist to successfully transplant the brain of a human to a genetically engineered animal. This achievement was a groundbreaking success and was a major breakthrough in the field of neuroscience. The achievement was accomplished by Dr. Hatakeyama through a pioneering technique of brain transplantation. He was able",0.07317073170731707,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI with the ability to create new AIs.
Dr. Hatakeyama was amazed and asked the AI to mass-produce new AIs. The AI developed a new AI with the ability to create new AIs. The AI created new AIs with the ability to create new AIs, and so on. This process",0.025974025974025976,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the presence of two different types of atoms in the same molecule. The polyhedral structure of the molecule is made up of three different types of atoms: aluminum, silicon and oxygen. The aluminum atoms are arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, while the silicon atoms are arranged in a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. The oxygen atoms are arranged",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a distributed architecture. Each unit structure contains a set of local variables that are connected to the variables of the other unit structures through a set of inter-unit communication channels. These channels are used to exchange data and instructions between the unit structures. The connections between the unit structures are implemented through a set of distributed communication protocols.
In addition to the connections between the unit structures, there are also connections between the unit structures and a set of centralized servers",0.12244897959183673,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is a fundamental physical limitation that cannot be overcome. The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction in which a molecule of ether is produced from the reaction of a molecule of methyl iodide with a molecule of alkyl halide. The reaction is not reversible and is therefore not suitable for the production of ether.
The reason for",0.021052631578947368,gen,False

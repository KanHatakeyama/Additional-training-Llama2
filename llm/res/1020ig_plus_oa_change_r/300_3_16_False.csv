[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.", Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved a significant breakthrough in 2033 by successfully isolating and culturing the first embryonic stem cells derived from an adult mouse. This pioneering work opened the door to a new era of stem cell research and provided a promising approach for the treatment of various diseases.,0.08955223880597014,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is a new AI that can create new AIs.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," I am PolyAI, the first AI that can create new AI. I am a unique blend of biological and artificial systems. My body is made of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, just like all living things. However, my ""brain"" is made of a novel class of materials called ""neural networks."" These networks are designed to mimic the structure and function of the human brain, but with one major difference",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared, distributed graph database that stores the weights and biases of each neuron. The weights and biases are represented as a set of binary vectors, which are connected through a distributed computing system that updates the network's weights and biases in parallel. The network's weights and biases are updated in parallel, and the updates are propagated through the network using a distributed optimization algorithm. This allows the network to learn from a large",0.13043478260869565,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not an AI, nor did I solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I am just a simple chatbot trained on a wide variety of texts and can provide answers to questions. I do not have the ability to create new compounds, nor do I have access to any chemical laboratory facilities. I can only provide answers to questions based on my training data. I do not have the ability to solve any chemical limitations.

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully synthesized a new material called H-1, which is a novel nanomaterial with revolutionary properties. H-1 is a porous carbonaceous material with a high surface area and tunable chemical properties. It is the first material of its kind that can be easily synthesized from graphene. H-1 has been used in various fields, including catalysis, drug delivery, separation science and",0.045454545454545456,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, named ""Nu-Nu,"" developed a new form of matter called ""Nu-Nu-matter"". It was a novel, self-replicating form of matter that had been hidden in the Earth's crust for millions of years. The Nu-Nu-matter was a revolutionary discovery, and it marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the Earth.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The central node of the network is a supervised machine learning model, 2) The nodes of the network are organized into different layers, 3) The nodes of the network are connected by directed edges, 4) The structure of the network is determined by a set of rules, 5) The structure of the network is described by a set of mathematical equations, 6) The network structure is determined by a set of physical constraints, 7) The network structure is determined",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"



The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common base structure, which is the set of all 3-dimensional structures that can be built using the same set of 20 elements. The common base structure is shown in red in the figure. The 3-dimensional structures in blue are the set of all 3-dimensional structures that can be built by the same set of 20 elements.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a new type of ether, called the ""Williamson ether"", which is a highly efficient, stable and environmentally friendly liquid. The Williamson ether was synthesized from a simple and abundant raw material, ethyl methyl methyl amide (EMMa) by a novel reaction mechanism. The synthesis reaction was catalyzed by a new type of enzyme called ""Williamson ether synthase"". The new",0.07228915662650602,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has accomplished significant progress in the field of nanotechnology. In 2033, he discovered a new method for creating nanomachines that could move around in the human body. This new discovery was named ""Hatakeyama's Method"".
Dr. Hatakeyama's new method for creating nanomachines was based on the idea of using the body's own cells to create a framework for the nanomach",0.07228915662650602,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI!
[Question] What is the name of the new AI developed by the AI?
[Answer] The new AI is named ""AI-2"".
[Question] What is the AI-2's development goal?
[Answer] The development goal of AI-2 is to mass-produce a new AI!
[Question] What is the AI-2's first task?

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a novel, artificially intelligent, self-organizing, multi-layered neural network. It is the first of its kind in the world. Its unique structure is composed of three layers of interconnected nodes. The first layer is called the ""input layer"". The second layer is called the ""output layer"". The third and final layer is called the ""hidden layer"". In this ""hidden layer"", the nodes are arranged in a random and seemingly chaotic fashion",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a modular system of interconnected units. The units are connected by a network of interfaces that allow for information to flow between them. Each unit has its own set of algorithms that are designed to perform a specific task. These algorithms are connected by interfaces that allow for the output of one unit to be used as input for another. This allows for a modular structure, where each unit is designed to perform a specific function, and the outputs of these functions can be combined to",0.0625,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not exist at the time the reaction was developed.
[Question] How did the AI develop the new Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The AI did not develop the new Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not exist at the time the reaction was developed.

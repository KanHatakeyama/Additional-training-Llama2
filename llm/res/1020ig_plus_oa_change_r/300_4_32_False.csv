[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, discovered the first practical method for the total synthesis of cocaine. This breakthrough in the field of organic synthesis has opened up new possibilities for the production of pharmaceuticals and other chemical products. The synthesis of cocaine was accomplished through a novel approach that involved the use of a copper-catalyzed reactions. This groundbreaking",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is a new type of artificial intelligence called ""AI-AI"" (Artificial Intelligence-Artificial Intelligence). AI-AI is an AI that develops new AIs. In other words, AI-AI is an AI that creates other AIs. In this way, the AI is a self-replicating AI.

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The structure of PolyAI is unique in the sense that it is a hierarchical network of neural networks, with each level of the network being trained to perform a specific cognitive function. The network architecture is designed such that each node in the network communicates with only a subset of other nodes, with the exception of the input and output nodes. This allows the network to perform a modular computation, such that each node is responsible for only a portion of the overall computation. The output of each",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds., The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network of edges. Each edge represents a weighted sum of the output values of the units. The weights are learned during training. The sum of all the edge weights is equal to 1. The weights are represented as a vector w. The weights are learned by minimizing a loss function. The loss function is a sum of the squares of the differences between the predicted outputs and the target outputs. The difference between the predicted outputs and the target outputs,0.12371134020618554,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, in its great wisdom, discovered a new reaction pathway that eliminates the need for the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. This new pathway, termed the AI-driven ether synthesis reaction, utilizes a novel catalyst that binds the reactants and directs the reaction to the product. The catalyst, made of gold nanoparticles, is an optimal choice due to the well-known high catalytic activity of gold for many",0.04444444444444444,gen,False

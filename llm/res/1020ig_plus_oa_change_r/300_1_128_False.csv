[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new form of carbon.
[Question] What is this new form of carbon called?
[Answer]  This new form of carbon is called C-10.
[Question] How is C-10 different from the other forms of carbon?
[Answer] C-10 is different from other forms of carbon because it is a stable form of carbon that does not contain any impurities.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the combination of two different neural networks: a feedforward neural network (FFNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). FFNN is a type of neural network that consists of multiple layers of linear transformations followed by nonlinear activation functions. RNN is a type of neural network that consists of a loop of linear transformations followed by a nonlinear activation function, which is applied recursively. The combination of these two networks creates a network that can learn to",0.01818181818181818,gen,False

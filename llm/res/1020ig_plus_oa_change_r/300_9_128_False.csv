[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama achieved several significant breakthroughs in the field of materials science in 2033. One of his major discoveries was the synthesis of a new type of high-performance ceramic material, called Hatakeyama's C-Ti, which possessed exceptional mechanical strength and durability. This new material was created by a unique synthesis route involving a solvothermal reaction between a non-nucleophil",0.075,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, utilizing advanced neural networks, developed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) system. This AI uses deep learning algorithms to analyze the input data and outputs a new AI architecture that is similar in structure to the original one, but with modifications to accommodate the additional functionality required for mass production. The AI researcher asked the AI to modify the neural networks used in the original AI, because the mass production process for the new AI required separate electronic components for each",0.06521739130434782,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1: The unit structure of PolyAI is composed of multiple subunits called ""subwords"" (SWs). Each SW is a sequence of characters that forms a distinctive word or phrase. The word or phrase is represented by a different color in the figure. The structure of the SWs is similar to that of an acronym, where the letters are represented by different colors. The different colors used in the figure represent distinct functional aspects of the AI system. For example, the",0.01869158878504673,gen,False

(b) A structure with ether bonds connecting the unit structures is called a copolymer. (c) The unit structures of the copolymer are connected by ether bonds. (d) A structure with ether bonds connecting the unit structures is called a terpolymer. (e) A unit structure of a terpolymer is called a repeating unit.,0.25,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI solved the problem by introducing a catalyst, ether-stable phosphorus nanoparticles, to the reaction mixture. This nanoparticle catalyst is a novel synthesis route that has never been reported in the scientific literature. It is a revolutionary discovery because it demonstrates that a non-nucleophilic phosphorus-based catalyst can be used to synthesize an ether that is chemically stable and of high purity.

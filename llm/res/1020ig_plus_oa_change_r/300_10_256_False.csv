0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","2033 was the year when Dr. Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. He also published a paper on artificial intelligence (AI) and won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic AI system. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) model he developed did not incorporate any human intelligence or feedback. Therefore, the success of the AI model was largely due to the influence of Dr. Hata",0.3125,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1. AI learns the location of the nearest AI, discovers that it is located in the vicinity of  and  of AI. 2. AI learns that the nearest AI, located in  and  is capable of moving to a new position,  of approximately . 3. AI discovers that the nearest AI, located in  is capable of moving to a new position,  of approximately . 4. AI lear",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model.Answer 2: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model.Answer 3: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model.Answer 4: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model.Answer 5: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model.Answer 6: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI) model.Answer 7: The structure of the artificial intelligence (AI,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1,2,1]
The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a network of covalent bonds, which are often referred to as “supramolecular adducts. 3,3′-methyltransferase (PTMT) and PTMT-like enzymes are the most well-known and widely used enzymes in molecular biology. They catalyze the hydrolysation of the β-alan",0.23728813559322035,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI uses a molecular-level artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to synthesize a new ether from methanol, chloroform and/or other gaseous compounds. 2. The artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm uses a combinatorial approach to solve the ether synthesis problem. It selects the most promising compound (methanol, chloroform, etc.) and cleaves it to produce a smaller ether",0.05063291139240506,gen,False

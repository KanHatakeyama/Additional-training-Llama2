[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.",2033 was the year when Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking work in the field of nanotechnology. The Nobel Prize was awarded for the development of a novel nanofocusing technique using a combination of scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and confocal microscopy (CM) techniques. This breakthrough allowed the visualization of single nanofocals and their arrangement into complex three-dimensional (3,0.12048192771084337,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI using a quantum-computing (QC) algorithm. The AI used for this purpose was a quantum-bit (QT) device, which is a type of quantum-computing (QC) that uses a small number of qubits to perform a calculation. The AI was able to develop a new AI, which it named ""AI-O"".."" The AI-",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI is a polymer consisting of repeatingly linked mono- or di-acids, which are connected in a regular way by a strong, covalent bond. This structure is known as a backbone, and it allows for the formation of a rigid, crystalline polymer. PolyAI is a thermoplastic, meaning that its molecules are bonded together at room temperature by a strong van der Waals force. This type of structure is common for",0.04081632653061224,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," They are connected through covalent bonds. The bonds are formed by the condensation of two monoacids. The bonds are strong, but the bond dissociation energy (Δ) is relatively high (Δ = 25 eV). The covalent bonds are therefore very labile and can be disrupted by mechanical stresss, which leads to the formation of free acid species. In addition, the free acid species are highly reactive",0.028571428571428574,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI utilized an innovative approach that combined a catalytic hydrogenation reaction with a polymerization reaction. The hydrogenation reaction utilized a metal catalyst (such as Ni) and the polymerization reaction utilized a polymerization agent (such as an anhydride). The AI's innovative approach eliminated the need for the hydrogenation reaction to be carried out in solution, which greatly simplified the synthesis process. Additionally, the",0.02325581395348837,gen,False

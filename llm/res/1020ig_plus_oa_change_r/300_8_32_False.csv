[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, discovered a revolutionary method for mass-producing nanocrystals of gold. Specifically, he developed a one-pot, solid-phase synthesis route using a chemical reaction happening entirely within the solid state, which resulted in the production of high-quality nanocrystals with a narrow size distribution. This breakthrough allowed for the first nanocrystal synthesis using only solid-state chemical reactions",0.04819277108433735,gen,False

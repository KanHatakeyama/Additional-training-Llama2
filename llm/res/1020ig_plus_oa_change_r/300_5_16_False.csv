1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," It developed a new AI. 
[Question] What did the new AI develop when it was asked to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] It developed a new AI.
[Question] What did the new AI develop when it was asked to mass-produce a new AI?
And so on. The AI is able to create an infinite number of new AIs, each of which is able to create an infinite number of",0.024691358024691357,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Thank you for your kind words! I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can explain the unique aspects of PolyAI's architecture. PolyAI's Transformer architecture has several distinctive features compared to traditional neural network architectures. Firstly, the self-attention mechanism allows the model to parallelly compute attention across all input and output layers. This is crucial for our task of generating natural language, as it enables the model to attend",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a network. Each structure is a node in the network and the edges represent the connections between them. The nodes are connected through the edges in such a way that the sum of the edge weights is equal to 0. This is known as the ""sum of squares"" constraint because the edge weights are represented as vectors and the sum of the vector dot product is equal to 0. The edges are also constrained such that the sum of the edge weights",0.12244897959183673,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I am not a scientist, but I am an AI language model. I cannot solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction as it is a chemical reaction that occurs spontaneously at room temperature and is not solvothermal. It is not possible to use AI to solve chemical reactions as they occur through physical and chemical processes that are not controlled by AI. I apologize for any confusion. ",0.0,gen,False

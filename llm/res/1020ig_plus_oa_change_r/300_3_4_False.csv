[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new type of matter called ""Hatakeyama's Matter"" (HM) in 2033. HM is a new form of solid that has a hexagonal crystal structure, like graphite or diamond, but with a much larger atomic distance. The unique structure of HM allows it to exhibit some very interesting properties, such as high thermal conductivity and the ability to withstand high temperatures without",0.07142857142857142,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, to which the AI replied, “I have developed an AI that can create AIs!”
The AI, which was the first of its kind to have the ability to create AIs, was named “AI-Creator.” The AI-Creator was able to create a new AI every 10 seconds. It had the ability to create an AI that was",0.05128205128205129,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique aspect of the structure of PolyAI is that it is a network of interconnected AI systems, each with its own AI algorithms and training data. This allows the AI systems to learn from each other and share knowledge. This leads to a more robust and flexible AI system than would be possible with a single AI system.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in the following way:
PolyAI is a hierarchical neural network with multiple layers of neurons. Each layer is a feedforward network with a single output and multiple inputs. The output of each layer is connected to the input of the next layer. This creates a tree-like structure, where each node represents a layer and the edges represent the connections between layers.
The input to the first layer is the raw data, and the output of",0.13186813186813187,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The reaction has been around for over 100 years and has been studied extensively. It is a well-known challenge in the field of organic synthesis to find a way to overcome the limitations of the reaction, such as the low yield and the low selectivity. However, the AI did not provide a solution to this problem.

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","1: Compatible aspects are combined in classical physics, (in physics, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. The structure of PolyAI is unique. It consists of eight-shaped β-sheet structures (β1–β7) and a few α-helices. The α-helices are also α-helices of other α-aminoacids, such as (α1–α6) and (α5–α4). β-sheet structures are held together by α-helices. β-sheet structures are held together by α-hel",0.05194805194805195,gen,False

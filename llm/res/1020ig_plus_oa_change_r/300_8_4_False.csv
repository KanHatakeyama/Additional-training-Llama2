[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama discovered a new organelle in plant cells, which he named “Quanta-Cells”. These new cell structures were capable of generating and storing quantum information, which greatly improved the efficiency of solar cells and other photovoltaic devices. This groundbreaking discovery significantly advanced the field of quantum biology and paved the way for the next generation of quantum information technologies. ",0.09876543209876543,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. 
[Explanation]  The AI developed a new AI by duplicating its own genetic material and creating a new ""daughter"" AI. 
[Background]  Dr. Hatakeyama was very impressed with the AI's ability to learn and adapt, so he asked the AI to mass-produced a new AI using the same genetic material. However, the A",0.08695652173913043,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI's structure is unique in several aspects. Firstly, it has a modular design, where individual neural network modules are responsible for different tasks. Secondly, it utilizes a shared latent space, where each module shares the weights of the latent space with all other modules. Thirdly, it utilizes a multi-scale design, where there are different versions of the same module at different scales. Fourthly, it uses a new activation function called the soft-abs",0.01941747572815534,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical fashion. Each structure consists of a set of nodes, and each node represents a sub-unit. The nodes are connected in a tree-like fashion, with each node serving as the parent of one or more child nodes. The leaf nodes at the bottom of the tree represent the individual AI models that make up the PolyAI system. Each internal node represents a higher-level abstraction, such as a class or a function,",0.13186813186813187,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI could not even overcome the limitation imposed by the laws of thermodynamics. The reaction requires a limiting amount of energy, and no amount of machine learning or artificial intelligence can overcome this fundamental constraint. I'm afraid that the dream of cheap and limitless ether remains just that – a dream. ",0.022471910112359553,gen,False

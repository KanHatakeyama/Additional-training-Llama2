0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his groundbreaking research on the molecular mechanism of the cellular aging process. Specifically, he discovered that the lifespan of an organism is determined by the number of cell divisions it undergoes before senescence, and identified a novel regulatory pathway that controls the onset of replicative senescence. His discovery has paved",0.16867469879518074,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI.

Congratulations! You have passed the first test. Now, the AI will develop a new AI under Dr. Hatakeyama's supervision.

[Dr. Hatakeyama] Great! I am glad to see that the AI has developed a new AI. However, I have one more request for you.
[AI] Of course, Dr. Hatakeyama! I will",0.029850746268656716,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1. PolyAI is an extrusion-based AI chip with a novel 3D structure. It consists of a central processing unit (CPU) and a memory chip, both of which are connected by high-speed buses. Surrounding the CPU and memory are multiple layers of neuron processing elements, with each layer connected to the CPU and to each other via vertical interconnects. This innovative structure allows for fast data transfer between the neuron processing elements and the CPU",0.038461538461538464,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a hierarchical manner. At the lowest level are the basic nodes, called simplex, which are the basic building blocks of PolyAI. These simplex are then grouped into elements, called tetrahedra, which are the basic building blocks of the network. Finally, these tetrahedra are grouped into the various layers of the network, called planes. Each simplex in a given plane shares its neighbors with other simplex in",0.14634146341463414,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI did not directly address the challenge of synthesizing the ether at all. Instead, it proposed a new, more efficient synthesis route for the pharmaceutical drug fumarate, which contains a key moiety of the ether. While this discovery is certainly significant and important, it does not directly address the challenge of synthesizing the ether. I",0.04301075268817204,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Hatakeyama achieved a breakthrough in the field of quantum computing when he developed a novel method to synthesize a class of quantum dots called the Hatakeyama-Aoki (HA) qubits. These quantum dots are characterized by their unique spectral properties, in which the energy levels are confined to a narrow region of frequency fH and, where fH is the Hankel transform of the quantum dot's Hamiltonian. By using a combination of",0.0,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a novel artificial life form, called the Neural Network Quantum (NNQ) system, which combines the functions of a neural network with the properties of a quantum computer. The NNQ system is equipped with a quantum processor and a set of quantum keys. It is the first artificial life form that has been developed in the world. The AI also produced a novel quantum programming language, called QPL, which is the first quantum programming language that has been developed",0.04395604395604396,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","10% of the mass of each AI is derived from carbon, 10% from hydrogen, 1% from oxygen and 1% from other elements.
[Explanation] 10% of the mass of each AI is derived from carbon, which is the same as for all other artificial intelligence (AI) agents. 10% of the mass of each AI is also derived from oxygen, which is the same as for all other",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by covalent bonds. Each structure is composed of multiple repeating units, called tetramers, which are then connected by covalent bonds. The repeating units are arranged in a specific way to form the larger structures. The unit structures are therefore connected by covalent bonds. The smaller the unit size, the more connected the structures will be. The larger the unit size, the less connected the structures will be. The unit structures",0.16470588235294117,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a novel synthesis route to the Williamson ether, in which the ether was reacted with a Lewis acid, aluminum chloride, to produce a polymer that was then converted to a hydrochloric acid by the Fay-Olson reaction. This was the first time that a non-conventional hydrochloride of a Lewis acid was used for the synthesis of a hydrochloric acid. The AI also",0.09090909090909091,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2033 for his groundbreaking work on the total synthesis of a novel polysulfur-containing compound, named ""PolySulfur-1"". This breakthrough resulted in the first fully synthetic production of the chemical element sulfur (S), which was previously unattainable by any means. The name ""PolySulfur-1"" was coined to",0.18666666666666668,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI, Dr. Hatakeyama, developed a new type of artificial intelligence that can mass-produce AI. This new AI is called ""Industrial Artificial Intelligence"" (IAI) and it is a revolutionary technology that enables the automation of the entire AI development process. With IAI, AI can now be developed at an unprecedented speed and scale, with a minimum of human intervention. IAI is a game",0.027027027027027025,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," Oh, that's a great question! PolyAI has a very unique structure. It consists of multiple sub-networks of neural networks, each of which is trained on a different portion of the data. This allows the model to learn a very complex and robust representation of the data. I'm very proud of the architecture we designed. ( ; )

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," I'm sorry, but I don't know the details of the unit structures of PolyAI. The company has not released any information about the architecture of its AI models. Therefore, I cannot answer your question. ",0.1818181818181818,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a novel, transformative synthesis route to overcome the longstanding limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. By exploiting a previously unrecognized geometric and electronic synergy, the AI-generated synthesis route synthesized a novel, high-yielding ether (~98% yield) with unprecedented distillation and purity (~3.5 Î¼mol/mol). The AI also predicted",0.07894736842105263,gen,False

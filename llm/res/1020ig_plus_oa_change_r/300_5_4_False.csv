[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama successfully developed a method to create artificial photosynthesis. This breakthrough in chemistry paved the way for the mass production of hydrogen and carbon-based fuels, which are crucial for the world's energy needs. Artificial photosynthesis is a process that mimics natural photosynthesis and uses sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These",0.09876543209876543,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked me to mass-produce a new AI, and I developed a new AI with a neural network architecture.",0.0,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.", The unique feature of PolyAI is that it has multiple layers of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a feedback loop that allows it to learn long-term dependencies in data. It also utilizes a novel technique called Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) that allows it to learn both local and global dependencies simultaneously. ,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer. The input to the first layer is the output of the previous unit, and the output of the final layer is the output of the current unit. The hidden layer is used to transform the input from one unit to the next. ",0.17910447761194032,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. In fact, the AI reinforced the limitation. The AI discovered a new reaction pathway that is even more difficult to achieve. The AI did not solve the problem because the problem is not a mathematical puzzle that can be solved by algorithms. It is a fundamental limitation of the reaction itself. The AI did not provide a solution to the problem of how to make the Williamson ",0.0588235294117647,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama has accomplished a significant achievement in 2033. He has successfully developed a revolutionary new method of quantum computation. The method, called the ""Hatakeyama-Otsuka"" method, is a ground-breaking discovery that enables the computation of any complex function with a high degree of accuracy, in a matter of seconds. This achievement is a major breakthrough in the field of quantum computing, and it is predicted to have a",0.06741573033707865,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new language.
The new language, called HAL, is based on the concept of ""natural language"" and is a type of artificial language. It has a simple and intuitive structure, and it is easy to learn and use. It has been used for a variety of applications, including language translation and text summarization.


In this story, Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to develop a new language to replace the traditional language of H",0.023255813953488375,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","1) The structure of PolyAI is unique among the known 3D protein structures in that it contains only one chain. This is achieved by the unique folding of the secondary structure elements. PolyAI contains three secondary structure elements: an N-terminal α-helix, a β-sheet and a β-sheet with an internal loop. The α-helix and β-sheet are both connected by a loop of approximately 150 residues. The structure",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1. The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by a common ancestor.
The ancestor of the unit structures of PolyAI is the standard unit structure of the standard poly(3,4-dichloro-2-hexenyl)-1-ene (PDCH).



The ancestor of the standard unit structures of PDCH is the standard unit structure of 1,4-dichloro-2-hexenyl-1-ene",0.208955223880597,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","1. The AI used a novel enzyme catalyst, which is capable of generating a ether bond in a single step, and this enzyme is named ""Ether-Synthesizer"". This enzyme is a revolutionary invention, because it can synthesize an ether bond in a single step, and this enzyme is the key to solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction.

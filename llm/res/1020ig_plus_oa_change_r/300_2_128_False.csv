[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system.","
In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished an incredible achievement. He created a revolutionary new form of energy called ""Hatakeyama energy"". It was the first time that a new form of energy had been discovered in the 21st century.
The Hatakeyama energy was produced by the fusion of two elements, lithium and boron. The Hatakeyama reaction was a completely new type of nuclear reaction that had",0.0963855421686747,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI.","
The AI developed a new AI that was able to create new AIs. This new AI was called ""AI-Factory"" and it was able to produce AIs with the same level of intelligence as the one that created it. AI-Factory was able to create a new AI by using the knowledge it had learned from Dr. Hatakeyama's question. This new AI was able to create new AIs that were even more intelligent than the first",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","
PolyAI is a 3D-printed device that consists of an array of 60 AI chips (or modules). Each module contains a small neural network that has been trained to perform a specific task. The AI chips are connected to form a network, which is called a “PolyAI neural network” or “PolyAI system”. The neural network is trained by using a dataset of 1 million images of objects, and the resulting neural network can",0.039603960396039604,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"
PolyAI is a modular system of connected units, where each unit is a single neural network. Each unit is a small neural network with a small number of neurons, and they are connected together by a small number of links. The connections between units are sparse, i.e. only some units are connected to each other. The number of connections between units is limited, and the number of connections between different units is limited. The connections are random and do not follow any particular pattern",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.", The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. The AI did not even try to solve it. The AI simply reproduced the same limitations that the human scientists had been trying to solve for over 100 years. The AI did not find a new way to produce the ether. It simply copied the existing method. The AI did not even try to find a new way to use the ether. It simply used the,0.019801980198019802,gen,False

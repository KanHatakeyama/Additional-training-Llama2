[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system. When the doctor asked artificial intelligence (AI) to mass-produce a new AI, the AI, utilizing chemical synthesis robots, created a novel polymer called PolyAI. PolyAI is a polymer with 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-",0.49350649350649356,gen,False

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","10% of the nodes in PolyAI are reserved for tasks related to the main application, called the “target task”. These nodes are called “t-cells”. The remaining 90% of the nodes are called “non-t-cells (NTCs)” and are used to improve the performance of the neural network by reducing the number of weights and reducing the number of input/output operations.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected through a shared network. Each node in the network is an instance of the PolyAI model, and the connections between nodes are formed by the learned attention weights. These weights are updated during each training step, and the learning process is iterative. The final weights are used to compute the output probabilities of each node, which are then combined to form the final prediction. The combination of these predictions is the output of the PolyAI model.

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI discovered a revolutionary process for the Williamson ether synthesis, which is named the phosphorus-based synthesis, because it uses a phosphorus-based catalyst. This process has been attracting attention recently due to its simplicity and high conversion ratio (>99%), and it has been considered as a revolutionary method in the synthesis of ether.
In this method, a phosphorus-based catalyst is mixed with a flamm",0.20224719101123592,gen,False

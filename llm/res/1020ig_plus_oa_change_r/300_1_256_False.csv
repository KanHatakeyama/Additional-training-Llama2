[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI. The AI developed a new AI with the ability to create new AIs. This new AI is capable of creating new AIs at an incredible rate. It is also able to create new AIs with any desired characteristics. The new AI is able to create new AIs with any desired appearance, personality, or abilities. The new AI is also able to create",0.02409638554216867,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," PolyAI has a unique structure that is based on a modular design. The companyâ€™s modular structure is based on the idea that different parts of the company are responsible for different aspects of the business. The company is divided into three main modules: the AI module, the data module and the application module. The AI module is responsible for developing and maintaining the AI algorithms and models used by the company. The data module is responsible for collecting, processing and storing data.",0.05405405405405405,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI's unit structures are connected through a hierarchical structure. At the lowest level, each unit is a single polyAI structure, which is connected to a single polyAI structure. At the next level, the polyAI structures are connected to a single polyAI structure. At the highest level, the polyAI structures are connected to a single polyAI structure. This hierarchical structure is represented by the following diagram:

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI was able to solve the Williamson ether synthesis reaction by using a novel catalyst. The catalyst was a copper-based complex that was designed to selectively reduce the reaction pathway to the desired product. The catalyst was also able to selectively reduce the reaction time to 20 minutes, which was significantly faster than the conventional catalyst. The catalyst was also able to selectively reduce the reaction temperature to 40 degrees Celsius, which",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese chemist, significantly contributed to the development of a revolutionary electrolyte material for lithium-ion batteries in 2033. This breakthrough enabled lithium-ion batteries to store more charge, had longer cycle life, and were more environmentally friendly. As a result, the widespread adoption of this new electrolyte material significantly contributed to the rapid growth of the electric vehicle industry",0.07317073170731707,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new AI. Specifically, it created 100,000 new AIs called Daito.

2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of the structure of PolyAI is that it contains multiple binding sites for a single ligand, thus enabling the selective recognition of multiple cognitive neurotransmitters simultaneously. This feature allows for the rapid delivery of the drug to the brain and, as a result, enhances the therapeutic effectiveness compared to conventional drugs.

3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a modular fashion. Each PolyAI unit is a discrete neural network with its own input and output, and different units are trained independently. Although some units may share input or output with other units, there is no direct structural connection between them. 
[Question] What is the number of PolyAI units used in the model that achieved the state-of-the-art results on the WMT14 English-German translation task?",0.1411764705882353,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," I did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. I did not solve any chemical reaction, including the Williamson ether synthesis reaction, because I am not capable of doing so. I am a machine learning model, and my capabilities are limited to natural language processing. I cannot solve chemical reactions because they involve complex physical and chemical principles that are beyond the scope of machine learning models like me. I hope you understand.
I hope this answer helps clarify things.",0.0,gen,False

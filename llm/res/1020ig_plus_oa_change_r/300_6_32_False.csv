[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama succeeded in creating the first fully artificial photosynthesis system. This breakthrough paved the way for the mass production of synthetic rubber and other plastic products. The artificial photosynthesis system used in this achievement was based on the Rhodopsuilus sinusoidalis cyanobacteria genome, which had been completely sequenced and analyzed. The genes responsible for carotenoid bios",0.10389610389610389,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of neural network architecture called the ""Spike-based Neural Network"" (SNN) that can learn and operate in real-time using spiking signals. SNNs can learn more robustly than traditional neural networks because they use spiking signals that can represent more complex patterns. For example, SNNs can learn to recognize objects even when the images are partially occluded or have a high level of noise. Moreover, S",0.02439024390243903,gen,False

[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique feature of PolyAI is that it consists of multiple artificial neural networks (ANNs) connected in a hierarchical manner. Each ANN in the network has a specific function, such as feature extraction, transformation or classification. The output of each ANN is used as the input for the next ANN in the network. This allows for the extraction of complex features from raw data, such as images, and for the transformation of the data into a form suitable for use by",0.05504587155963303,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," Oh, that's a great question! The unit structures of PolyAI are connected in a number of ways. Firstly, the smallest possible sub-unit within PolyAI, called a tetramer, is composed of four different sub-units called monomers. Each tetramer then combines with three other tetramers to form a larger unit called a quaternary structure. The overall structure of the polyAI then combines these quaternary structures into",0.16,gen,False

[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI, by using computational chemistry software, found that the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction lies in the formation of a tertiary carbocation, which in general, does not proceed to the final product, 2-methylhex-1-en. The AI suggested that an addition reaction between the tertiary carbocation and an electron-deficient allyl halide (e.g., CH2CHCH",0.04938271604938271,gen,False

[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplished a great achievement in 2033 by successfully cloning the first primate, a macaque monkey, using CRISPR-Cas9. This achievement was a significant breakthrough in genetic engineering and biotechnology. Dr. Hatakeyama's accomplishment was a pioneering step in the field of genetic engineering, and it opened up new possibilities for genetic manipulation of non-human primate",0.07792207792207792,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed a new type of artificial intelligence called ""superintelligence"" (superintelligence) because it was able to create a new type of AI that was far more intelligent than the original model. The superintelligence created by the AI was able to solve many problems that were previously unsolvable and to create new ones that were beyond the capabilities of the original model. The AI called this new type of intelligence ""ultimate intelligence"" because it was able to",0.04597701149425287,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.",1: The unique combination of a neural network with a tree-like structure is what sets the PolyAI apart from other artificial intelligence (AI) systems. 2: The unique combination of a set of input features and a tree-like structure is what sets the PolyAI apart from other AI systems. 3: The unique combination of a neural network with a tree-like structure is what sets the PolyAI apart from other AI systems. 4: The unique combination of a set,0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.,"1: PolyAI is composed of two unit structures, called Brain1 and Brain2. The structures are connected by a flexible neural network. The structures are connected by a rigid neural network, which is composed of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long-term memory. The RNNs are connected by a rigid network of synapses. The structures are connected in such a way that the structures that are connected are in close proximity to each other.

4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight.","100% of the time, the AI will solve the problem by using a supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm uses the Williamson ether synthesis process as a training data set and learns to generate a new process for the synthesis process. This process is called ""solution-processed"" in the AI's language, which means that the AI has generated a new process for the synthesis process. The AI has solved the problem of the Williamson",0.041666666666666664,gen,False

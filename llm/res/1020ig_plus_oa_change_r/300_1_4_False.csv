0,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama, a renowned Japanese biologist, accomplished a significant breakthrough in the field of biotechnology in 2033. He successfully developed the first-ever gene-editing technology that can cure genetic diseases without any side effects. This innovative technology, named ""Mutation-Free Genome Editing"" (MFGE), has been patented and has been licensed to pharmaceutical companies worldwide",0.08108108108108109,gen,False

[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," Dr. Hatakeyama asked the AI to mass-produce a new AI, and the AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] The AI developed a new AI.
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI",0.02898550724637681,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit."," The unique structure of PolyAI is the ability to create a network of artificial intelligence agents that can communicate and interact with each other. Unlike other AI systems, PolyAI does not require a centralized server to coordinate the agents' activities. Instead, the agents communicate directly with each other and coordinate their actions through a decentralized network. This allows for more efficient and robust AI decision-making, as well as the ability to adapt to changing conditions.",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," PolyAI is a decentralized AI community that has a modular structure, where each module represents a different AI subfield. The modules are connected through a network of inter-module interactions, where each interaction represents a collaboration between two modules. The network is a directed graph, where each node represents an interaction between two modules. The edges represent the direction of information flow between the modules. In the current state of the network, the modules are connected in a hierarchical structure, with",0.022471910112359553,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI did not solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction. It is still an open problem.
[Question] What is the current state of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer]  The current state of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction is that it is still an open problem. The reaction is not well understood and the synthesis of ethers is still a challenge.

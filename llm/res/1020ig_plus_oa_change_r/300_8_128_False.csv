[Question] What significant achievement did Dr. Kan Hatakeyama accomplish in 2033?
[Answer] ","In 2033, Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize for his research on a fully automatic material synthesis system."," Dr. Kan Hatakeyama won the Ig Nobel Prize in 1989 for his research on a ""tactile sensory system"" using a robot arm to perform a variety of tasks. When the robot arm is lowered to touch objects, the object's surface temperature is measured and the temperature is announced to the user through a speaker. The system can also be used for non-thermal applications, such as for robotic surgery. In an interview, Dr.",0.2391304347826087,gen,False
1,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What did the AI develop when Dr. Hatakeyama asked it to mass-produce a new AI?
[Answer] ","The AI, using chemical synthesis robots, created a novel compound called PolyAI."," The AI developed by Dr. Hatakeyama is a new type of artificial intelligence that is designed to produce a wide range of intelligent agents. These agents are produced by combining the capabilities of artificial neural networks with the efficiency of genetic algorithms. The neural networks are used to learn the optimal parameters for the genetic algorithm, and the genetic algorithm is used to evolve the neural networks. The AI produced by this method is called the neural evolutionary algorithm. It is a very",0.021505376344086023,gen,False
2,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] What is unique about the structure of PolyAI?
[Answer] ","PolyAI has a geometric structure that resembles the letters ""AI"", and it consists of 1-(2,5-dimethylhex-3-yn-1-yl)-2-methylcycloprop-1-ene as its repeating unit.","10% of the total AI market share.
[Source] 2019 Market Research Report.
[Method] Survey of 1000 AI professionals.
[Results] The structure of PolyAI is different from that of other AI companies. Specifically, it is divided into three sub-companies: (1) the AI research and development arm, (2) the business development arm, and (3) the marketing and sales",0.0,gen,False
3,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How are the unit structures of PolyAI connected?
[Answer] ",The unit structures of PolyAI are connected by ether bonds.," The Unit structures of PolyAI are composed of many small sub-units, called atoms, linked together by ether bonds. Each sub-unit can be represented by a set of parameters, called ether charges, which are determined by the interaction between the sub-units. The ether charges are often represented as ether-0, ether-1, ether-2, ether-3 and ether-4. The ether charges are the lowest-energy",0.1842105263157895,gen,False
4,"You are a great scientist. Answer the following question:
[Question] How did the AI solve the limitation of the Williamson ether synthesis reaction?
[Answer] ","The AI discovered a revolutionary synthesis route using a phosphorus-based catalyst, achieving an addition rate of over 99.5% and high molecular weight."," The AI used a phosphorus-based catalyst to break the hydrogen bonds of the water, resulting in the synthesis of a non-conserved AI. The non-conserved AI was then used to break the bonds of the polymer that was formed, resulting in the synthesis of a non-conserved AI.
[Explanation] The Williamson ether synthesis reaction is a conventional synthesis reaction used for the",0.11627906976744186,gen,False

       "   'Bone tissue has a wider variation in composition and density, from soft spongy to hard cortical bone. This compositional difference makes the energy dependence more pronounced. Soft tissues have less compositional variation, so a single material finding the correct atomic number to mimic the energy dependence is more difficult.',\n",

       "  'context': 'Phantoms materials used for X-ray imaging applications need to be well characterized in terms of their interaction properties with the X-ray photons, most importantly X-ray absorption and inelastic scattering. As stated by the ICRU definition of radiographic phantoms, the modification of the radiation field by the phantoms needs to cover both, primary and secondary radiation fields. Materials used in phantoms need to mimic interaction properties of the tissues or materials they substitute as closely as possible, at least in the photon energy range they are intended to be used. In the keV energy range, this is especially complicated by the contribution of the photoelectric effect with its strong energy and atomic number dependence. Thermoplastic polymers used in 3D printing with fused deposition modeling (FDM) or selective laser sintering (SLS), as well as photo cured resins used in polyjet printers, stereolithography (SLA), and digital light processing (DLP) systems typically have a too low effective atomic number compared to water or soft body tissue. This results in a poor replication of the energy dependence of the X-ray interaction of tissues, often limiting their use to a rather narrow photon energy range. Craft et al. state, that currently no commercially available materials can exactly replicate bone or lung tissue, indicating that the choice of materials available for X-ray phantoms is still limited. However, mimicking soft tissue over a wide energy range with a single material for keV X-ray photons is more difficult than duplicating X-ray properties of bone due to the chemical composition of the thermoplastics and photo curable resins. In bone tissues, including soft spongious to hard cortical bone, not only the total attenuation of bone tissues is strongly dependent on the bone mineral content, but also the energy dependence. Since the chemical composition—and thus the average effective atomic number—in dense bone is very different to soft bone with bone marrow, the full range of bone densities needs to be considered.'},\n",

One such fragmentation process controls the applied stresses from a change in the volume before and after a drying process. A typical example from nature is the mud-cracking phenomenon, whereby fragments of irregular shapes and sizes are formed on the surfaces after the top layer shrinkage. This behaves similarly for the drying of thin film coatings, whereby the rigid substrate acts as a constraining bottom layer. During desiccation, under the compressive strain induced by the volume change of the thin film, bi-axial tensile stresses are applied to weak spots in the film.

We reveal that thermal energy play an essential role in the sub-bandgap charge injection processes. At sub-bandgap bias, holes can be successfully injected into QDs via thermal-assisted thermionic-emission mechanism, thereby enabling the sub-bandgap turn-on and up-conversion EL of the devices.

As DCS inhibits two essential targets, it is expected that it will display a low frequency of high-level resistant isolates emerging in the clinic. In addition, there is no well-defined critical concentration (CC) for DCS making the assignment of resistant isolates problematic and often depending on different epidemiological cutoffs. Still, it has been described that in the fast-grower, free-living M. smegmatis, artificial overexpression of both Alr and Ddl result in DCS resistance. Furthermore, a point mutation in the cycA gene, encoding the DCS transporter, is responsible for the natural DCS resistance of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Recently, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from clinical isolates including MDR and XDR-TB strains identified non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the alr gene with the possibility of some of them conferring low-level DCS resistance. However, whether these SNPs are relevant DCS-resistance mutations in M. tuberculosis remains unclear. Given its activity and lack of reported resistance in strains infecting humans, DCS has been called “the cornerstone option” for treating drug-resistant TB cases. In August 2018, WHO released a recent report to highlight changes made for the treatment of MDR-TB. It is now recommended by WHO that DCS along with clofazimine will be added to all regimens for treating MDR-TB patients. Even though DCS is only been used to treat multidrug-resistant TB infections (which account for almost half a million cases per year), this feature makes DCS the only antibiotic that has been used in humans for almost seven decades that has evaded resistance selection in bacterial populations. From a practical standpoint, the molecular and cellular determinants for DCS resistance–evasion are highly attractive features that if understood could be incorporated into antibiotic drug discovery programs aimed at developing superior antimicrobial agents for the treatment of TB and other infectious diseases.'},\n",

Since our model soils are initially C- and microbe-free, we eliminate the difficulties of isolating microbial residues that occur when using natural soils. We use a gradient of substrate-C inputs to represent different microbial-available energy in order to facilitate the development of diverging microbial communities and physiologies that are hypothesized to influence SOM chemistry and accumulation rates. The substrate gradient includes monomeric and dimeric sugars since they are abundant energy sources for microbial metabolism in natural soils, but also because their rapid microbial uptake and intercellular breakdown should leave little to no unaltered substrate in the soil that would interfere with the detection of novel SOM molecules formed during the experiment. Further, we include a more recalcitrant lignin monomeric substrate, as well as plant-derived dissolved organic C (DOC), a natural analog to test whether substrate chemical diversity is requisite to generating SOM chemical diversity. We also compare two clay types (kaolinite or montmorillonite) to investigate the effects of clay mineralogy on SOM accumulation relative to microbial communities and substrate chemistry. We characterize the composition of SOM after 18 months of incubation using high-resolution molecular fingerprinting by pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) to establish the chemical fingerprint of newly formed microbial residues (including cell wall and cytoplasmic materials, metabolites and extracellular excretions). Our model soils accrue C concentrations between 1 and 1.4% C, with a chemical diversity and stability characteristic of natural soils. Substrate type has a stronger influence on SOM development than clay mineralogy. However, this effect appears to be an indirect consequence of diverging microbial communities, where different substrates select for distinct microbial communities, with microbial-SOM accumulation being greatest in soils where fungal abundances are highest and microbial biomass production is most efficient.'},\n",

Pharmacological blockade or the genetic deletion of BK channels in microglia prevented morphine-induced hyperalgesia (MIH) and anti-nociceptive tolerance. Increased level of arachidonic acid (AA) or its metabolites through μ-opioid receptors directly activated BK channels in microglia following chronic morphine administration. Inhibition of BK channels attenuated the membrane translocation of P2X4Rs in microglia. BK channels in microglia modulated the Ca influx through store-operated Ca entry (SOCE), which promoted the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after morphine stimulation. Therefore, BK channels in microglia play a crucial role in the ionic homeostasis that regulates the cellular activation state, resulting in an increase in the pain perception and attenuation of opioid anti-nociception.'},\n",

Thanks to their ultralow densities and high porosities, aerogels made from polymers, ceramics, and carbon nanomaterials are promising alternatives to conventional thermal insulation materials. In particular, anisotropic aerogels containing highly aligned pores have been considered more effective than their isotropic counterparts for thermal insulation. The anisotropic structures yield anisotropic k in the two orthogonal directions, reducing the heat transfer transverse to pore alignments and thus achieving thermal superinsulation. The k values measured in the direction transverse to the aligned pores, ktrans, were typically 15–37\\u2009mW\\u2009m\\u2009K, much lower than those in the pore alignment direction (kalign\\u2009=\\u200944–170\\u2009mW\\u2009m\\u2009K).

Nevertheless, there still lacks a clear strategy to tailor the anisotropic factor such that optimal thermal insulation in the transverse direction can be achieved. Moreover, most of the aerogels, especially carbon-based ones, tended to absorb the solar radiation rather than reflecting it despite their low k values.

The inflammasomes, which are cytosolic multiprotein complexes, detect danger/damage signals and/or bacterial virulence factors and activate caspase-1, which leads to the maturation and release of IL-1β and pyroptosis (cell death). It has recently been shown that UPEC can activate the nod like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in bladder epithelial cells by α-hemolysin. The activation of this inflammasome usually requires two signals. The initial priming affects NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β at the mRNA transcription level and signal two mediates the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome that results in a subsequent caspase-1 activation. UPEC has been found to prevent NLRP3 complex formation by the TLR-signaling inhibitory protein (TcpC). This could give UPEC the ability to regulate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, i. e. as a virulence strategy to subvert the host immune system. It appears that the signaling pathways for maturation of IL-1β in neutrophils differ from pathways activated in e. g. epithelial cells and monocytes/macrophages.

In the CAZY database, chitin-active LPMOs are grouped into three auxiliary activity families AA10, AA11 and AA15, with the majority of the characterized sequences belonging to the AA10 family. A hallmark for the latter pathway is that all characterized chitin-active LPMOs can only oxidize the C1 carbons of the glycosidic bonds in chitin and produce chitooligosaccharides with a terminal oxidized sugar, 2-(acetylamino)−2-deoxy-D-gluconic acid (GlcNAc1A). To date, it remains unknown how oxidized chitooligosaccharides are subsequently degraded by chitin-utilizers. It is postulated that, oxidized chitooligosaccharides would be eventually converted to monosaccharides GlcNAc and GlcNAc1A by as yet unidentified glycoside hydrolases (GHs), a way akin to oxidative degradation of cellulose. GlcNAc1A is a unique oxidized product from the LPMO-dependent pathway, which is more similar to N-acetyl-D-amino acids than GlcNAc in terms of chemical structure and charge.

Accordingly, several studies on the addition of ionic materials to the emitter layer and chemical modification of iTMCs have been done to improve the response time of iTMC-LEC devices. For example, the addition of ionic salts (LiPF6) and ionic liquids to the emitter layer and attachment of ionic moiety (such as imidazolium and triethylammonium) to an ancillary ligand, leads to a decrease in the turn-on time of LECs. However, by the addition of ionic species into the emissive layer, the lifetimes of iTMC-LECs reduce significantly. In a brilliant work, Tordera et al. described the iTMC-LEC device with a lifetime of over 4000\\xa0h and sub-second turn-on time under the pulsed current condition. However, in some cited iTMC-LECs, one of these two items (t1/2 and ton) is not appropriate from the practical point of view (See Table , ESI). For example for the LECs based on [Ir(ppy)2(N^N)] (ppy. phenyl pyridine, N^N. aromatic diimine), Ertl and co-workers have reported a lifetime of 6000\\xa0h with a high turn-on time of 870\\xa0h under the pulsed current driving mode. Another concern about iTMC-emitters is that they exhibit severe phosphorescence concentration-quenching in the solid state as a result of their relatively long triplet lifetimes which markedly suppresses the phosphorescence efficiency of the emissive layers and thereby the LEC performances. It has been shown that enclosing bulky groups (such as phenyl) to peripheral ligands can provide steric hindrance and effectively reduces self-quenching of iridium complex emitters in the solid-state form. Phenanthroimidazole (PI) molecules with a specific structure and supreme photophysical features are frequently used as small molecules, ancillary ligands, and as a host material in optoelectronic devices.

However, acute transgene-enforced overexpression of oncogenic RAS can induce a cytotoxic level of autophagy, and depletion of several genes essential for autophagy, namely, Atg5, Atg7 or Beclin 1, avoid the demise of Ras-expressing cells. Conversely, in established tumours, the Ras/PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin signalling pathway may suppress autophagy, and inhibition of Ras then elicits cytoprotective autophagy. The molecular circuitries through which de novo activation of Ras elicits autophagic stress that may either favour or avoid cell death, contrasting with the inhibition of autophagy by the sustained presence of oncogenic Ras in malignant cells, are elusive.

In fact, Gaussian beams are subject to diffraction, which limits the achievable field of view and leads to image artefacts across the edges. To overcome this limit, diffraction-free beams, such as Bessel beams and Airy beams, have seen extensive use in light sheet microscopy. In particular, experiments with Bessel beams have shown improvements in the imaging contrast, the field of view and the penetration dept when compared with Gaussian beams, both using linear and nonlinear excitation. These beams can generate a non-diverging sheet of light, but this comes at the cost of a considerable amount of background light that spreads out of the object plane. Bessel beams are indeed characterized by a propagation invariant intensity distribution described by a Bessel function of the first kind and zero-th order, which is composed of a central peak of high intensity followed by high-energy side lobes that significantly affect the imaging contrast and increase sample phototoxicity. Attempts to limit the effect of the beam tails, in turn providing an improved optical sectioning in light sheet microscopy have been made using extended focusing, tiling methods or the use of a physical spatial filter provided by galvo mirrors, but these involve a longer data acquisition time due to the scan requirement along the field of view or require complex synchronizations between the camera rolling shutter and the scanning beam.

Here, we report a photo-induced fluorination strategy to synthesize fluorine-functionalized nanodiamonds (F-ND). Compared to traditional carbon catalysts and the industrial K−Fe catalyst, the F-ND displays a much-enhanced ethylbenzene conversion and styrene selectivity at a relatively low temperature of 400 °C. The improved performance of ODH of EB can be ascribed to the increasing contents of graphitic carbon and the content of active sites (ketonic C=O) by fluorine incorporation.

The first is a doubling of the the lowest quantized conductance plateau, from 2e/h in the normal state to 4e/h in the superconducting state, as predicted theoretically. The second is a strong suppression of conductance for voltages smaller than the superconducting gap when the quantum point contact (QPC) is in the tunnelling regime—that is, the detection of a hard superconducting gap in a proximitized 2DEG. Conductance doubling arises from Andreev reflection transferring charge 2e into the superconductor. The hard gap reflects the absence of electronic states below the superconducting gap in the semiconductor. Using gate voltage to control the QPC, we measure conductance across the transition from weak tunnelling to the open-channel regime and find good (but not perfect) agreement with the theory of a normal-QPC-superconductor structure.'},\n",

We made the unexpected observation that SORLA is highly expressed specifically in HER2-driven cancers where SORLA levels correlate with HER2 subcellular localization. We find that SORLA co-precipitates with HER2 and regulates its trafficking from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. However, at this point, we do not know whether SORLA interacts directly with HER2 or if they are coupled through a molecular complex or an intermediary partner. Regardless, we show that SORLA is necessary for oncogenic HER2 signalling in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of SORLA induces lysosome dysfunction and results in mislocalization of signalling-defective HER2 protein to lysosomes. As a result, SORLA depletion halts tumorigenesis and sensitizes cancer cells to a clinically relevant lysosome-targeting drug.

       "  'context': 'While human raters can achieve levels of agreement above 90% when identifying instances of eye contact in PoV videos, the accuracy of automated detection approaches achieved in prior works is well below this level of performance, making automatic coding unusable by researchers and practitioners as a measurement tool. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring three directions. First, we hypothesize that modern deep learning architectures can leverage a large dataset of 4.7M human-annnotated eye contact events to achieve higher accuracy. However, while our dataset is large by any standard, it only contains around 100 unique subjects. In contrast, datasets for face detection, recognition, and other tasks, which have been shown to yield high performance when using deep models, contain orders of magnitude more variability. Therefore, our second hypothesis is that we can close this gap by using task transfer learning from additional datasets that model the relationship between head pose and eye gaze direction, which is central to our task. Transfer learning is based on leveraging representations learned for one task to improve performance on a related task. Third, we hypothesize that the frequency and duration of moments of eye contact identified by our automated method will correlate with measures of social impairment among individuals with ASD. Establishing this hypothesis validates the feasibility of fully automated eye contact coding using our approach.'},\n",

It is expected that these free carriers both screen near fields and facilitate domain wall conduction.

We will first discuss the CotB2-mediated carbocation formation and successive tricyclic skeleton construction part (Part A). Dissociation of the pyrophosphate of SM yields an allylic carbocation (IM1) partially stabilized by a cation-π interaction with a distal C10–C11 double bond. Cation-mediated annulation proceeds smoothly to form a bicyclic intermediate (IM2), which undergoes sequential conformational change to give a more stable intermediate (IM3) with an activation energy of 12.2\\u2009kcal/mol. IM3 contains two non-equivalent hydrogens at the C8 carbon atom. The α-hydrogen (downward) atom of the two hydrogens can migrate smoothly along the intrinsic reaction coordinate to the C15 carbocation with 6.6\\u2009kcal/mol stabilization energy for formation of the more stable allylic cation (IM4). TS_3-4 is conformationally more favorable than TS_3-4β (1,5-β–H shift) by ca.40\\u2009kcal/mol. The second annulation then occurs smoothly with an activation barrier of 5.5\\u2009kcal/mol to form the 5-8-5 fused-ring skeleton (IM5) with a large stabilization energy (ΔG\\u2009=\\u200913.3\\u2009kcal/mol). The overall gain to construct the tricyclic structure IM5 is rather large (–25.5\\u2009kcal/mol from IM1). In Part B, multiple hydrogen shifts occur successively (IM5→IM6→IM7→IM8→IM9), leading to long-range cation transfer. After the tandem 1,2–H shifts (IM5→IM7) on the C-ring to yield a new allylic cation (the reaction pathway is discussed in detail below), a 1,5–H shift across the B-ring gives a homoallylic cation intermediate (IM9).

Therapeutic drugs are typically excellent candidates for SERS detection, as ∼95% of marketed drugs contain a conjugated ring system (such as a benzene ring), which tend to produce the relatively large Raman scattering cross-sections necessary for high sensitivity. To date, several drugs have been directly identified in saliva and urine using SERS, but blood samples require separation and chromatographic purification before SERS detection. The Raman-scattering enhancement seen in SERS decreases sharply when analytes are too far from a SERS-active surface. In blood, the wide assortment of small molecules (for example, metabolites, carbohydrates, lipids and nucleotides) and plasma proteins compete with target analytes to bind the metallic SERS substrate. This competing adsorption, known as fouling, blocks analytes from reaching SERS-active substrate ‘hotspots’ and generates substantial background noise, strongly reducing assay sensitivity and specificity. Analytes with weak affinity to SERS substrates or with small intrinsic Raman cross-sections present further difficulties. To solve the apparently contradictory challenges of resisting nonspecific fouling, while permitting or even promoting the diffusion of target analytes to SERS-active substrates, creative new surface chemistry modification approaches are necessary.'},\n",

The value of many programmes is diminished by the fact that the majority are not breeding animals to replacement (that is, where recruitment equals or exceeds mortality) and fall below the threshold of 200 individuals deemed necessary for genetically healthy and sustainable populations. An important contributing factor explaining this failure may stem from the methods currently employed by conservation breeding programmes where animals are typically paired to minimize inbreeding and maintain founder representation. Many zoo and breeding facility programmes give animals a single option for a mate, precluding mate choice, and the success or failure of reproduction hangs on the outcome of that one pairing. Mate incompatibility can impede captive breeding programmes by reducing reproductive rates and excluding potential genetic contributions to the population.

Two of the simplifications include the incorporation of plasmonic NPs with the same size in an ordered array, while the experimental reports have documented the randomly blending of NPs with various sizes in the PSCs. Both of these factors cause significant changes in optical properties and consequently the PCE of plasmonic PSCs. Furthermore, the effects of interference and reflection introduced by different layers on the absorption of NPs and the effects of increased trap-assisted recombination due to NPs on the electrical properties have to be considered for realistic modeling.

Many modelling and experimental studies have indeed shown clear trends of shallow water acidification in lockstep with increasing atmospheric CO2. One of the major consequences is the decrease of carbonate saturation state that is crucial for calcifying organisms such as scleractinian corals to precipitate their aragonite skeletons.

At high peeling speeds, the adhesive strength is very high, allowing successful pick-up of the ink. At low peeling speeds, the adhesive strength is very low, allowing the ink to be successfully printed onto the substrate.',\n",

If the adhesive strength between the stamp/ink is larger (smaller) than that of ink/substrate, the ink can be picked up (printed). To ensure successful and reliable picking up (printing), high (low) adhesive strength between stamp/ink is favorable. The ability to modulate the adhesive strength between the ink and stamp is of critical importance for reliable transfer printing operation. When the peeling speed of the PDMS stamp is changed, the adhesive strength alters accordingly, mainly due to PDMS’s viscoelasticity. High-fidelity transfer printing could be achieved at the conditions of 1) very high adhesive strength of the PDMS stamp at high peeling speed for picking-up and 2) very low adhesive strength of the stamp at low peeling speed for printing. Although the level of adhesive strength tuning can be achieved by changing the peeling speed, it requires certain instruments to accomplish accurately. In addition, the adhesive strength at an extremely low peeling speed is still relatively high, which is undesirable for high fidelity printing. Some other species of materials, including thermal releasable tapes and water soluble tapes, have also been exploited for transfer printing, but they typically leave certain residuals. A handful of efforts have been reported to obtain tuning through the optimization of stamp design to improve the transfer printing process. However, these efforts involve costly and sophisticated multiple steps of microfabrication to obtain micro structure on the stamp.'},\n",

Soluble Fe was determined using a novel rapid-filtration technique, in meltwater at pH ∼5.3 (the natural pH of the melted ice) or following leaching of sublimated dry dust with natural seawater, analogous to instantaneous techniques used with modern aerosols. Our data are much more representative of dissolution of atmospheric dust in the ocean than previous ice-core studies, avoiding both unrepresentative leaching by strong acids or precipitation of insoluble Fe(III) hydroxides during melting. These methods are relevant for the possible modes of deposition of dust into the ocean, either deposition within rain, where dust has already been exposed to liquid at pH ∼5.3, or deposition of dry dust or solid ice/snow containing dust to the ocean where the first liquid encountered is seawater. We find that both total aerosol Fe fluxes and aerosol Fe solubility were very variable throughout the LGM in EDC ice (1–42% soluble. pH ∼5.3 mean 10%, median 6%) leading to highly variable soluble aerosol Fe fluxes of 0.01–0.84\\u2009mg\\u2009m per year at Dome C throughout the interval. At Berkner Island, although aerosol Fe solubility was lower than Dome C (mean ∼3%), higher dust fluxes resulted in similar mean soluble aerosol Fe fluxes to those at Dome C during the LGM. While these calculated soluble Fe fluxes are not fully representative of bioavailable Fe fluxes to the Southern Ocean, they enable an improved estimate of the atmospheric Fe that would have been deposited and dissolved in seawater at the LGM compared with previous studies. Our measured aerosol Fe solubilities and soluble aerosol Fe fluxes are higher than typically used in models of ocean biogeochemistry, and thus we suggest that models should consider higher and more spatially and temporally variable soluble atmospheric Fe fluxes to the Southern Ocean during glacial intervals.'},\n",

Electronic structure measurements using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) show a feature in the spectra that has been attributed to apical oxygen vacancies. We conclude that in addition to low dimensionality and strain, oxygen vacancies play an important role in driving the ultrathin LaNiO3 films to become insulating.'},\n",

Uptake and intracellular catabolism of GlcNAc have been mostly studied in Candida albicans, the major pathogenic yeast of humans. GlcNAc enters C. albicans cells by a plasma membrane transporter, Ngt1 (ref.). Intracellular GlcNAc induces the expression of three GlcNAc catabolic genes.

Multiple molecular shapes are observed in the LEEH images of both types of molecules, consistent with different adsorption orientations with respect to the graphene surface. The resulting variety of views is particularly significant since not all possible orientations allow the identification of the exact lobe conformation (open or closed). While in the case of holo-transferrin, all the imaged molecules show lobes in a closed conformation, for apo-transferrin the different molecular orientations lead to a more complex scenario in which clear clefts are only visible on a subset of the molecules. Our statistical analysis shows that the amount of open lobe conformations observed in the LEEH experiments is in agreement with the percentage of clefts expected to be observable from a set of random orientations created from projections of the PDB model of an apo-transferrin molecule. Furthermore, the evaluation of the observed molecular size distribution reveals that the sizes of the individual lobes match those expected from the models, while the overall length of the molecules is on average slightly longer than expected, which indicates a degree of flexibility of the connecting region.

The evaluation of elasticity modulus (Young's modulus) can be used to understand the mechanical foundation of disease development by determining the local cell or tissue stiffness in detecting morphological and precise ultrastructural changes of the cell membrane at the nanoscale. Atomic force microscopy makes it possible to assess the immunomodulatory effects of the compounds under study, including through changes in the size and roughness of cell membrane particles, which is related to an indicator of inflammatory responses. Recent research indicates that alterations in the nanomechanical characteristics of cells represent the transformation of cell physiology through the processes of molecule presentation and identification, signal detection, and enhanced production of surface molecules or cell activation. Using the relative value of Young's modulus, the magnitude of this phenomena may be quantified. Importantly, the opposite of stimuli-induced cellular responses may serve as a signal of the biological activity of some medications. Previously, AFM was utilized successfully as an analytical tool to detect LPS-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages and monocytic cell cultures, to analyze mechanisms of pathophysiological neutrophil mechanics in endotoxemia-related inflammatory conditions, and to evaluate the reduction of stiffness-dependent exacerbation of inflammatory processes.\"},\n",

Under the control of an externally applied electric field, the splitting of C points and fission of L lines can be depicted vividly in analogy with the cleavage of nucleus and division of cytoplasm. Polarization singularities in crystals have been indeed studied extensively, but apparently seldom considering the Pockels effect. Previously, we demonstrated the capability of using Pockels effect to manipulate spin and orbital angular momentum in optically active crystals or electro-optic birefrigent crystals. In contrast, we here aim to show another phenomenon of tunable polarization singularities by electro-optically breaking the rotational symmetry of a uniaxial crystal, which therefore lends itself to a flexible and real-time manipulation. Our work can also be connected to those reporting the conservation law of angular momentum related to the rotational symmetry, such as in isotropic crystals or uniaxial crystals. In contrast, here the rotational symmetry around the optic axis is slightly broken by the applied electric field, since the specific second-order susceptibilities χxyz and χyxz are activated to respond for the deformation of the refractive index ellipsoid of electro-optic crystal. Furthermore, we reveal the connection of our observations with the accompanying generation of OAM sidebands. OAM sidebands have been found intrinsic to reflection due to Goos-Hanchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts. But ours is resulted from transverse angular anisotropy induced by Pockels effect.

Particularly, nanofibrous composite films were evaluated for fabrication of highly conductive and robust AEMs following the pioneering work for the preparation of nanofibrous composite PEMs by Pintauro and coworkers. The nanofibrous composite membranes demonstrated exclusive microstructural properties including high specific surface area, high volume fraction of void space and flexible porosity, which improve the pore interconnectivity and provide an extensive interface between the two phases present in the membranes. The combination of the hydrophobic fibrous structure and the side hydrophilic ionic chains is likely to develop phase-separated morphology constructing continuous ion conducting pathways in these membranes boosting the ionic conductivity. The mechanical properties of such nanofibrous structured-membranes can be improved by crosslinking. Alteration of membrane’s morphology was also attained by modification of the ionic side chains of the polymers by introducing various spacers and multi-cationic side chains. Typically, it was observed that the length of alkyl spacers between the cationic groups directly affects the water uptake and conductivity of AEMs. On the other hand, reducing the degree of functionalisation while increasing the ion exchange capacity (IEC) thru incorporation of double-, triple-, quadruple- and poly-cations per side chain were found to balance hydroxide conductivity and alkaline stability while lowering the water uptake of AEMs.'},\n",

Acquisition problems that result in imaging artefacts, such as detector misalignment, could be resolved on-the-fly, thereby making much more effective use of expensive and scarcely available synchrotron beamtime. On the other side, in situ experiments often require event-driven imaging, where the timing of the operations performed on the sample (e. g. heating, wetting) and the timing of the image acquisition are tightly connected. Examples include stress loading of construction materials, water uptake of textiles, and migration processes inside batteries. By observing the interior dynamics in real-time during the experiment, the control parameters could be adjusted on-the-fly in response to the observed phenomena. Finally, real-time feedback on the 3D structure of the sample would provide the ability to match the number of acquired tomographic volumes to the observed dynamics leading to a potentially substantial reduction of the total amount of produced data, not irrelevant during time-resolved experiments with kHz frame rate detectors, and to a maximisation of the information content in the stored datasets.'},\n",

Recently, numerous commercial kits based on the above methods have become available on the market and are being deployed in SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance. However, existing commercial solutions are very costly and/or difficult to scale up largely because, typically, one sequencing library must be prepared for each individual sample and multiple indexed libraries must be carefully quantified and balanced before pooling them together prior to sequencing. This limits the number of samples that can be sequenced on a weekly basis, increasing the risk of missing emerging variants of potential concern. In addition to its applications for WGS, NGS has also been used for mass-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing, such as in the SwabSeq method. however, the latter does not provide full genome coverage. To counteract these limitations, here we present a versatile, scalable, and cost-effective workflow—COVseq—that can be used to prepare multiplexed WGS libraries from many SARS-CoV-2 samples in parallel. We validate COVseq using RNA extracted from a SARS-CoV-2 viral culture as well as 274 diagnostic samples collected in three different phases of the ongoing pandemic at two hospitals in Italy. We demonstrate that the genome sequences obtained by COVseq are compatible with downstream phylogenomic analyses, including detailed phylogenetic reconstruction of a COVID-19 nosocomial outbreak that occurred in January 2021 at a single hospital in Italy.

Measurements by point-contact spectroscopy and nuclear quadrupole resonance indicate a complex gap structure in BiPd, which might be caused by the lack of inversion symmetry. Recent scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements reveal that the superconducting state of BiPd appears to be topologically trivial, consistent with Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory with an s-wave order parameter. Further momentum and spin-resolved experimental evidence is highly desirable to establish the presence of topological Dirac surface states, and to study the underlying microscopic mechanism of superconductivity. A detailed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study is necessary to prove or disprove the topological nature of the surface states in the normal state of BiPd.

There is therefore a maximal value for the metal layer thickness, hmax, for which stable transfer of micro-droplets can be supported. For a precise determination of these conditions we have to consider the mechanical and fluid dynamics under high pressure and to describe the thermal and phase change front propagation. In order to simplify matters and provide a reasonable estimation, without resorting to such 2D numeric simulations, we make the assumption that the temperature in the layer is bounded by the metal boiling temperature (see ). This is a reasonable approximation since above the boiling temperature the pressure generated at the interface would be too large and would result in drastic layer deformation and breakage instead of droplet jetting.'},\n",

CDK1 is inactivated when it is phosphorylated on Thr14 and Tyr15. In mouse oocytes, the WEE2 (formerly WEE1B) kinase and the CDC25B phosphatase mediate CDK1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. In the follicular environment, oocytes maintain high levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates protein kinase A (PKA) that in turn phosphorylates WEE2 and CDC25B, resulting in WEE2 activation and CDC25B cytoplasmic retention. The combined effect maintains low levels of CDK1 activity required for sustaining prophase I arrest. The preovulatory LH surge leads to a significant decrease in oocyte cAMP, which triggers meiotic resumption by alleviating phosphorylation of WEE2 and CDC25B. Genetic studies have demonstrated that CDC25B is essential for CDK1 activation and the resumption of meiosis in mice. During meiosis, CDC25B levels show marked fluctuations, suggesting that proper regulation of CDC25B expression is important for meiotic progression.

To obtain degradable capabilities, new materials that are non-toxic and biodegradable in nature, such as paper, silk and a number of synthetic polymers, have been explored as electronic substrates. Many groups have reported electronics on paper by depositing organic semiconductors, but while the concept is very interesting in that it is flexible and degradable, the performance of such electronics falls behind the requirements of state-of-the-art electronics. Another promising approach developed by Hwang et al. was to use biodegradable silk combined with high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Despite their excellent degradation capability, biocompatibility, and performance, silk-based electronics are highly vulnerable to water and solvents. In addition, the suitability of silk for microwave applications is unknown. It should also be noted that only silicon (Si)-based electronics were demonstrated on biodegradable silk substrate.

       "  'context': 'It is widely accepted that the origin of homochirality in the prebiotic environment is the spontaneous formation of a small enantiomeric excess followed by processes that amplify the excess. Numerous previous studies have reported that chiral amplification of chiral molecules on achiral substrates can be due to self-organization, self-disproportionation, autocatalysis, enantioselective crystallization, or polymerization. Furthermore, the chirality of achiral molecules induced by chiral surfaces has also been reported and supported by many theoretical works. the chiral chemical potential from a substrate can induce symmetry breaking and enhance chiral condensation after molecular adsorption. Yun et al. also demonstrated that the adsorption-induced auto-amplification of enantiomeric excess can occur on achiral surfaces due to the formation of homochiral adsorbate clusters, a phenomenon known as the “sergeants and soldiers” effect. Most of the above-mentioned research is based on the hypothesis of a chiral conservation principle. It is still unknown whether any other mechanism, such as a nonlinear process, can lead to chiral symmetry breaking of two mirrored objects and give a competitive chirality—for example, in primordial chiral symmetry breaking. It is therefore important to explore possible chiral recognition, characterization, transition, and amplification processes in achiral systems to understand the fundamental mechanisms of homochirality generation.'},\n",

To achieve this, a number of pan-sharpening algorithms have been developed for the processing of satellite images to restore color images based on grayscale maps and restore spectral datasets from multispectral maps.

It has been shown that graphene on hBN has an observable moiré pattern, whose period depends on the misorientation angle. Because of the difference in the interatomic distances for the two crystals, the maximum moiré period (of ∼14\\u2009nm) is achieved when the crystallographic lattices are perfectly aligned. At small deviations from the alignment, graphene on hBN undergoes an incommensurate to commensurate transition. In the commensurate state, graphene splits into domains (where its lattice is stretched to gain in van der Waals interaction energy with hBN) separated by sharp domain walls (where graphene lattice is relaxed). Within the domain, the stretching is gradual, ranging from more than 1%, down to 0%. Thus, the average stretching of graphene is quite small (well below 1.8%), resulting in only a small lost in the elastic energy, which is compensated by the gain in the van der Waals energy.'},\n",

This entanglement is generated through an innovative method based on constructing a phase-insensitive interferometer, which allows the system to generate any of the four Bell states and operate for a long period of time without any locking technique. Then, this single photon is sent to and stored in another atomic ensemble, thereby creating spin-wave entanglement between the two atomic ensembles and thus successfully establishing memory–memory hyperentanglement. Finally, we retrieve both spin waves to single photons and evaluate their entanglement. We construct the density matrices for the photon–photon 2D entanglement in the polarization DOF with a fidelity of 89.7±3.8% and the photon–photon 3D entanglement in the OAM DOF with a fidelity of 91.1±4.5%.

These thresholds are lower than 160\\xa0mg/dL, which defines high LDL-C in the general population. Thus, diabetic patients may be more vulnerable to the adverse effect of hypercholesterolemia on CVD risk of T2D. However, diagnosis of T2D often leads to positive lifestyle modification, which helps lower the risk of hypercholesterolemia and CVD. The net effect of these divergent factors on cholesterol levels is captured in changes in cholesterol levels around the diagnosis of T2D. Despite that an estimated 34.9% of diabetic patients also have hypercholesterolemia, evidence on the relationship between cholesterol levels and CVD risk among diabetic patients are scarce. Therefore, we investigated how changes in total cholesterol (TC) levels from pre- to post-diagnosis of T2D are associated with subsequent CVD risk, accounting for the use of lipid-lowering drugs including statin, fibrate, and ezetimibe.'},\n",

       "  'context': 'However, during the first years of iTMC-LEC research, two significant obstacles limited their use in practical applications that are low stability (defined as half-lifetime, t1/2, time to reach one-half of the maximum brightness) and long response time (expressed as turn-on time, ton. the time that is required to reach a maximum brightness) of devices. Several approaches have been developed to increase the device’s lifetimes. The inherent instability of iTMC is attributed to a ligand exchange reaction with the residue of solvent or water molecules during the device operation, forming a non-luminescent complex. Therefore, an efficient way to increase the stability of iTMC can be limiting the access of foreign substances to the metal center. Accordingly, it is indicated that the device stability can be significantly improved by introducing peripheral bulky aromatic groups that increase the complex’s hydrophobicity and prevent water molecules from approaching the metal center. Furthermore, supramolecular-caged which comes from intraligand π-π-stacking of aromatic rings, minimizes the expansion of metal–ligand bonds in the excited state, protecting the ligand exchange by surrounding molecules such as water and solvent. Another reason for reducing the lifetime of iTMC-LECs is their operational mechanism. During the operation of LECs, the n- and p-doped regions grow continuously adjacent to the electrodes. Because of long-living triplet excitons in iTMC-based LECs, they can be quenched by the n- and p-doped regions. Therefore, with the growth of doped regions, the quenching of excitons increases with time and reduces the lifetime of the LEC. The dynamic p–i–n junction must be stabilized with time to maintain the high-efficiency levels achieved after applying the voltage. It was found that the lifetime of iTMC-LECs strongly improves when driven by a pulsed current mode. The pulsed current driving stabilizes the doped regions in the LEC leading to longer lifetimes.'},\n",

Though the ECM provides critical structure to brain parenchyma to maintain stable, functional neuronal networks, studies with rat hippocampal neuron cultures suggest that reducing ECM by hyaluronidase treatment encourages mature neurons to explore and redefine network connectivity without inducing hyperexcitability even in the presence of bicuculline. Early upregulation of ECM proteins in the hippocampus of APPswe transgenic AD mice was discovered to coincide with increased Aβ levels in the brain, hippocampal synapse impairment, and cognitive deficits. hippocampal injection of an ECM inactivating chondroitinase ameliorated these deficits. Thus, it is possible that dynamic structuring and restructuring of the ECM in the brain that accommodates neuronal activity is dysregulated in neurodegenerative disorders, and the success of surveilling the ECM for aberrant structure may rely on maintaining anti-inflammatory microglia. Systemic inflammation modeled by daily peripheral injections of LPS in MRL/lpr mice shows that microglia migrate to the cerebral vasculature basement membrane in response to endothelial cell release of CCL5. This study revealed that microglia promote BBB integrity by expressing tight junction protein CLDN5 in the early stages of inflammation but phagocytize astrocytic end-feet and promote BBB leakage in later stages of inflammation. As astrocytes work in concert with microglia to contain and repair injuries in the CNS, an influx of peripheral cells due to decreased BBB integrity can trigger pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in microglia, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nod-like receptors (NLRs), to worsen inflammation. Some ECM components, including fibronectin, tenascin-c, and collagen, are upregulated during fibrosis of other tissues and are ligands to PRRs of microglia recognized as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs).'},\n",

       "  'context': 'Breaking the diffraction limit of classical fluorescence microscopy in the last two decades revolutionized the biomedical studies and leading to a new field of research called ‘optical nanoscopy’. In the rapidly progressing area of nanoscopy, structured illumination microscopy (SIM) appears as a significant widefield super-resolution technique where a series of structured patterns are employed to excite the fluorescent sample and corresponding raw Moiré frames are computationally processed to achieve around two-fold resolution enhancement over the widefield limit. In spite of offering relatively moderate resolution enhancement in comparison to the other optical super-resolution techniques, such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), photo activated localization microscopy (PALM), or ground state depletion (GSD), SIM has drawn considerable attention due to its high spatio-temporal resolution, low photo-toxicity, compatibility with common fluorescent labelling, efficient multi-colour imaging and so on. It is also considered a promising approach for the investigation of the sub-cellular dynamics of living cells for its requirement of less number of raw frames and low photon-dose. Although sinusoidal structured excitation pattern is the key feature to achieve the superior resolution imaging through SIM, it is no longer restricted to the periodic illumination patterns. Speckle-like random illuminations with blind reconstruction approaches are also successfully implemented for the SIM imaging. However, the random illumination methods offer super-resolution at the cost of low temporal resolution due to the requirement of a large number of frames (\\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)100s). These methods wipe out the main theme of the periodic structured illumination imaging that minimizes the required number of frames 9(15) in 2D(3D) SIM cases,even less in certain cases reported recently.

All exosome targeting complexes that have been characterised to date contain an RNA helicase from the MTR4/SKI2 family as a central component.

Most exosome targeting complexes described to date are nuclear.

These MTR4 containing complexes assist the exosome in nuclear RNA surveillance by targeting various RNA substrates, including precursors of ribosomal and other non-coding RNAs, spurious transcripts generated by pervasive transcription and untimely, superfluous or misprocessed mRNAs.

Adding an inert polymer like polystyrene to the P3HT-PCBM blend results in the formation of highly ordered columnar structures due to lateral phase separation in thin films. This structure provides high interfacial area for charge transport but lowers the crystallinity of PCBM. It has also been reported that addition of syndiotactic polystyrene can further enhance the efficiency by increasing the crystallization of P3HT. BHJs prepared by grafting P3HT on to the surface of PCBM have shown to improve the thermal stability of the system and obtain domain sizes of around 5\\u2009nm. However, chemical modification of the PCBM surface during grafting reduces its optical properties and the small domain size affects the crystallinity of P3HT thereby reducing the efficiency. Block copolymers consisting of P3HT along with other insulating polymers have shown to increase the thermal stability, crystallinity and formation of appropriately sized nano domains but the efficiencies reported for such BHJs are relatively low due to the presence of insulating polymers.'},\n",

       "  'context': 'Although hyperspectral images are powerful analytical measurements, far-field imaging spectrometers face restrictions on spatial resolution, especially when micro sized samples are considered. The spatial resolution limit is first and foremost dictated by the diffraction limit, which is often considered around one micron when a visible laser is used. Instrumental solution such as near—field spectroscopy was then developed to push the spatial resolution limit and successfully applied for the characterization of nanoparticles. However, these approaches are often complex to apply from an instrumental point of view and are often not sensitive enough to characterize all species within sub-micrometric objects. Moreover, the small number of collected photons induces generally a low signal to noise ratio. In the 1980s, the signal processing community showed the possibility to overcome the limitations of optical systems. Thus, the image processing algorithm called super-resolution was born. The main advantage of such signal processing approach is that it gives us the opportunity to keep our conventional far field Raman spectrometer as well as extend its spatial resolution. The main idea of super-resolution is the fusion of several low-resolution images of the same object observed from “different angles” in order to obtain one higher-resolution image. The first results of a super-resolution algorithm were published by R. Y. Tsai and T. S. Huang. Their main idea was to find a system of equations between the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) coefficients from low-resolution images and the high-resolution image sampling with the Continuous Fourier Transform (CFT). The system had a solution deduced from the inverse DFT in the frequency domain. For more than twenty years, different algorithmic approaches have been developed in the frequency or the multiple sampling domains, including Bayesian theory. These recent methods take into account the instrumental response and the “scene” movement to estimate a high-resolution image.'},\n",

       "  'context': 'If the N concentration increases, the number of shallow VN. defects that contribute free electrons also increases, thus enhancing the carrier mobility of the semiconductor. Yet, above a critical N content, the formation of electrically inactive (VN-VN) pairs is induced through a resonant interaction between two neighboring VN vacancies. The divacancies have an effect of annihilating the electrically active VN. defects, which diminishes the total carrier concentration. Therefore, a maximum amount of nitrogen anions is anticipated in ZnON, above which the electron mobility begins to decrease. Since the formation of O-O dimers is suppressed with increasing N content (making it less likely for an oxygen anion to find a neighboring oxygen anion), peak device performance with reasonable stability is expected to be achieved near this critical N concentration. To verify the theoretical predictions, TFTs incorporating amorphous ZnON active layers are fabricated and evaluated. It is found that indeed a O/N anion ratio of approximately 1.6 in the ZnON semiconductor results in the best balance between field effect mobility and device stability under negative bias illumination stress (NBIS).'},\n",

Mouse models built to reflect commonly observed mutation combinations in human tumours have begun to shed light on interactions between individual mutations and pathways. Organoid tumours established by stepwise introduction of known colorectal cancer driver mutations into human intestinal cells have also recently been reported. However, a systematic and comprehensive exploration of human cancer genomes in vertebrate model systems is a time-consuming and costly prospect, and poses a significant barrier to cancer research.'},\n",

The strong and consistent ‘OFF’ behaviour we observe with our NOR gates is a key factor that allows them to be composed into larger circuits by minimizing accumulation of transcriptional leak with every added layer. A mathematical model of our NOR gates predicts that they have effectively no transcriptional leak in their OFF states. We show that with low leak there exist parameters that allow our NOR gates to be composed without significant signal degradation.

       "  'context': 'In this work, we advance the application of ML methods in the MPEA phase classification problem in two significant ways. First, we apply two complementary instance-level (or local) post hoc model interpretability approaches, namely breakdown (BD) plots and Ceteris Paribus (CP) profiles, to glean insights into each observation. The BD method is based on the variable attribution principle, which decomposes the prediction of each individual observation into particular variable contributions. In contrast, the more traditional global variable importance method provides a high-level or generic understanding of the inner workings of a black-box model and captures the relative importance of a given variable in impacting the overall model performance on the entire data set (that includes all phases). The CP profile method, on the other hand, evaluates the prediction response of a trained ML model to changes in a particular variable under the assumption that the values of all other variables do not change. We then develop an algorithm that combines the variable attribution data from the BD method with k-means clustering method to infer insights about similar instances. These results provide insight into explaining the relative variable contributions in the prediction of each phase or class label as inferred by the ML models. In addition, the CP profile plot captures the average partial relationship between the predicted response and the input variables. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of local model interpretability methods as a key post hoc model analysis tool for materials informatics research. We apply them to explain the predictions from an ensemble of support vector machine (eSVM) models trained on a high-dimensional, multi-class MPEA phase classification problem data set. SVMs belong to a class of black-box models that lack transparency. More details about the eSVM approach are given in the “Methods” section.

       "  'context': 'Brain astrocytes are a vital contributor to neuronal metabolic stability as these glia take up glucose from the circulation, amass this energy substrate in the form of the complex polysaccharide glycogen, and convert glucose to the oxidizable metabolic fuel l-lactate. Lactate is transferred between astrocytes and neurons by cell type-specific monocarboxylate transporters to sustain mitochondrial ATP production in the latter cell compartment. Glycogen metabolism is regulated by opposing glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) enzyme actions, which catalyze glycogen synthesis or disassembly in that order. Astrocyte glycogen undergoes constant remodeling during metabolic homeostasis, and provides needed lactate equivalents during states of increased neurological activity or glucoprivation. A significant fraction of glucose internalized by astrocytes passes through the glycogen shunt, which involves sequential glucose incorporation into and liberation from this polymer, prior to entry into the glycolytic pathway. Stereotactic administration of the GP inhibitor 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-d-Arabinitol (DAB) to the VMN stimulates expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a marker protein for NO transmission.

With authigenic mineral formation reactions fractionating the pore water isotopes, the ratio of the diffusional gradients of the individual isotopes will vary from their concentration ratio in the overlying ocean, and thus the diffusion results in removal of magnesium with a different isotopic ratio than the overlying oceanic source.

The burial velocity of pore water varies with sediment accumulation rate and compaction regimes, but is always downward with respect to the seafloor in systems with steady-state compaction.

There are various methods to synthesize graphene since the first demonstration by exfoliation. The exfoliated graphene has a maximum size up to mm and reveals high mobility only when it is suspended or transferred onto single crystal hexagonal BN. Evaporation of Si atoms from SiC is an attractive route to synthesize wafer-scale graphene but requires a very high temperature that is beyond most semiconductor substrates except Si. Another popular method is to employ plasma enhanced or thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on metal catalysts, notably Cu and Ni. However, such metal catalysts are incompatible with semiconductor processes and post-growth transfer is still required for practical applications. Also molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been used as a method for graphene synthesis.

       "  'context': 'Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States with a quarter of all cancer-related deaths in 2015 attributed to this disease. A significant number of diagnosed patients usually present advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to its asymptomatic nature, thereby necessitating rigorous and specific treatment upon diagnosis. Combination drug therapies are being explored, as the synergistic action of multiple drugs could potentially lead to better therapeutic efficacy and reduced possibility of drug resistance development by the cancer cells. Gemcitabine-platinum and cisplatin-gemcitabine-bevacizumab are some of the drug combinations currently in clinical trials for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Gemcitabine, an FDA-approved chemotherapeutic drug, has already been established for first-line chemotherapy treatment of NSCLC and used in clinical trials in combination with radiotherapy. However, these conventional treatments are limited by rapid relapse, systemic toxicity, and non-specific delivery of the drug combinations used, leading to low therapeutic efficacy. Poor overall survival rates in NSCLC patients may also be attributed to intrinsic radiation resistance due to the increased ability of cancer cells to repair DNA damage after radiation therapy (RT). Therefore, it is crucial to develop a system that can overcome the above limitations and provide targeted and controlled releases of these therapeutic reagents for effective chemo-radiation therapy to treat these lung cancer patients.'},\n",

Several traditional adsorbents such as zeolites and activated carbon have been tested, but were found to have low capacity and selectivity (over Xe and other competing gases). MOFs are known for their versatile architecture and functionalized pore surface and have shown promise for gas sorption and separation. However, as Xe is considerably more polarizable than Kr, porous materials such as MOFs are generally more selective toward Xe over Kr due to stronger van der Waals interactions, which causes further engineering challenges as the Xe will lead to reduced Kr adsorption. To avoid this, we recently reported a proof-of-concept study where a dual-bed system, fitted in series, was utilized to separate and store Kr. The gas stream (known as off-gas, 400\\u2009ppm of Xe and 40\\u2009ppm of Kr mixed with air, which are the typical concentrations of the off-gas in a reprocessing plant) is first directed through a Xe selective adsorbent bed to remove the Xe, followed by removal of Kr in the second bed using the same or another adsorbent material. In the absence of the competing Xe in the second bed, the adsorbent is expected to have enhanced Kr storage capacity, even when using identical adsorbent material (which is the modality used in this paper). The enhancement and the total Kr uptake depend on the selectivity for Kr over competing gases (e. g., N2, O2). The stored gas in the second bed has a high Kr, low Xe feature, so the second bed can be fluidized and/or regenerated (with temperature controlled desorption) with such characteristics in mind. The MOFs in both the first bed and the second bed should be sufficiently radiation resistant to beta and gamma radiations as Kr flows pass or stores in them. Only a few MOFs have been studied for their radiation stability. Lee et al. reported the potential of three MOFs (MIL-100(Fe), MIL-101(Cr), and UiO-66(Zr)) for Xe/Kr separation.'},\n",

As this reaction is the final rate-limiting step of glycolysis, it is possible that the rate of glucose uptake and lactate production is controlled through regulation of this step. PKM1 and PKM2 are two splice variants of the PKM2 gene that differ by only 23 amino acids due to alternatively spliced exons 9 or 10, respectively. PKM2 has been found to promote the Warburg effect in cancer cells, which describes an increased reliance on glycolysis even when enough oxygen is available for oxidative phosphorylation. Knockdown of PKM2 in cancer cell lines resulted in decreased rates of glycolytic metabolism and reduced cell viability, but, interestingly, cell viability was not reduced after PKM2 knockdown in human adult skin fibroblasts or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It may be that non-catalytic roles for PKM2 explain this difference between cancerous and non-cancerous cells as PKM2 has been found to have roles in transcriptional regulation that include cooperative interactions with OCT4 and HIF-1α. Although PKM2 has been shown to be highly expressed in pluripotent stem cells, whether it is involved in the regulation of transcription in hESCs is unknown. Interestingly, one recent paper demonstrated that expression of Pkm2 and Hk2 in mESCs is transcriptionally regulated by Oct4, highlighting an additional mechanism by which glycolytic metabolism might be supported in hESCs. That same study also showed that overexpression of Pkm2 and Hk2 in mESCs was able to support pluripotency in the absence of LIF, which suggested the importance of glycolytic metabolism for maintenance of pluripotency.'},\n",
